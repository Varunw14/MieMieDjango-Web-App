Methods: One hundred patients aged 45-90 years, 63% male (50 in AF and 50 age matched controls in sinus rhythm [SR]) were identified with arterial lines measuring beat-to-beat BP fluctuation. Non-invasive BP measurements utilising the manual sphygmomanometer (MS), PulseCor R6.5 (PC) and automated sphygmomanometer (AS) were taken simultaneously with invasive BP in a randomised sequence. This was repeated three times in each patient. Results: In SR differences in systolic BP (SBP) for MS, AS and PC were \u22120.34 mm Hg (95% CI \u22122.31 to 1.63; P =.733), \u22123.80 mm Hg (95% CI \u22125.73 to \u22121.87; P =.0001) and \u22123.90 mm Hg (95% CI \u22125.90 to \u22121.90; P =.0001) and for diastolic BP (DBP) were 6.02 mm Hg (95% CI 4.39-7.64; P <.0001), 8.95 mm Hg (95% CI 7.36-10.55; P <.0001) and 7.54 mm Hg (95% CI 5.89-9.18; P <.0001), respectively. In AF mean differences in SBP for MS, AS and PC were \u22127.33 mm Hg (95% CI \u22129.11 to \u22125.55; P <.0001), \u22125.29 mm Hg (95% CI \u22127.08 to \u22123.50; P <.0001) and \u22125.75 mm Hg (95% CI \u22127.54 to \u22123.96; P <.0001) respectively and for DBP were 5.28 mm Hg (95% CI 4.03-6.54; P <.0001), 6.26 mm Hg (95% CI 5.00-7.52; P <.0001) and 6.89 mm Hg (95% CI 5.64-8.15; P <.0001) respectively. Conclusions: The MS is accurate in SR because of direct assessment of Korotkoff sounds. Non-invasive BP assessment in AF is significantly less accurate. These findings have important prognostic and therapeutic implications.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072091570", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"26644757600": {"Name": "Eysenck W.", "AuthorID": "26644757600", "AffiliationID": "60013181", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Research Department, Eastbourne General Hospital"}, "57210972817": {"Name": "Ammar A.", "AuthorID": "57210972817", "AffiliationID": "60013181", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Research Department, Eastbourne General Hospital"}, "57210968611": {"Name": "Kanthasamy V.", "AuthorID": "57210968611", "AffiliationID": "60013181", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Research Department, Eastbourne General Hospital"}, "24177743600": {"Name": "Veasey R.A.", "AuthorID": "24177743600", "AffiliationID": "60013181", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Research Department, Eastbourne General Hospital"}, "7401624661": {"Name": "Patel N.R.", "AuthorID": "7401624661", "AffiliationID": "60013181", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Research Department, Eastbourne General Hospital"}, "7004099203": {"Name": "Furniss S.S.", "AuthorID": "7004099203", "AffiliationID": "60013181", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Research Department, Eastbourne General Hospital"}, "7004131426": {"Name": "Sulke N.", "AuthorID": "7004131426", "AffiliationID": "60013181", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Research Department, Eastbourne General Hospital"}, "57204674407": {"Name": "Freemantle N.", "AuthorID": "57204674407", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology, University College London"}}}
