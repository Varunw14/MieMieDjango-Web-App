Solar flares with a fan-spine magnetic topology are able to form circular ribbons. A previous study based on H\u03b1 line observations of the solar flares on 5 March 2014 revealed a uniform and continuous rotation of the magnetic fan-spine. A preliminary analysis of the flare time profiles revealed quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) with similar properties in hard X-rays, H\u03b1, and microwaves. Aims. In this work, we address the question of whether the observed periodicities are related to periodic acceleration of electrons or plasma heating. Methods. We analysed QPPs in the H\u03b1 emission from the centre of the fan (inner ribbon R1), a circular ribbon (R2), a remote source (R3), and an elongated ribbon (R4) located between R2 and R3. We used methods of correlation, Fourier, wavelet, and empirical mode decomposition. We compared the QPPs in H\u03b1 emission with those in microwave and X-ray emission. Results. We found multi-wavelength QPPs with periods around 150 s, 125 s, and 190 s. The 150 s period is seen to co-exist in H\u03b1, hard X-rays, and microwave emissions, which allowed us to connect it with flare kernels R1 and R2. These kernels spatially coincide with the site of the primary flare energy release. The 125 s period is found in the H\u03b1 emission of the elongated ribbon R4 and the microwave emission at 5.7 GHz during the decay phase. The 190 s period is present in the emission during all flare phases in the H\u03b1 emission of both the remote source, R3, and the elongated ribbon, R4, in soft X-rays and in microwaves at 4-8 GHz. Conclusions. We connected the dominant 150 s QPPs with the slipping reconnection mechanism occurring in the fan. We suggested that the period of 125 s in the elongated ribbon can be caused by a kink oscillation of the outer spine, connecting the primary reconnection site with the remote footpoint. The period of 190 s is associated with the three-minute sunspot oscillations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acceleration of particles", "Magnetic reconnection", "Sun: chromosphere", "Sun: flares", "Sun: radio radiation", "Sun: X-rays, gamma rays"], "IndexKeywords": ["Continuous rotation", "Empirical Mode Decomposition", "Magnetic topologies", "Microwave emissions", "Preliminary analysis", "Quasi-periodic pulsations", "Quasi-periodicities", "Reconnection sites"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094893781", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"12767931400": {"Name": "Kashapova L.K.", "AuthorID": "12767931400", "AffiliationID": "60069972", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Solar-Terrestrial Physics SB RAS"}, "36934030000": {"Name": "Kolotkov D.Y.", "AuthorID": "36934030000", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Fusion Space and Astrophysics, Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}, "8872194400": {"Name": "Kupriyanova E.G.", "AuthorID": "8872194400", "AffiliationID": "60070886, 60021331", "AffiliationName": "Central (Pulkovo) Astronomical Observatory of the RAS"}, "56181549700": {"Name": "Xu Z.", "AuthorID": "56181549700", "AffiliationID": "60014205, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Yunnan Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "26435468500": {"Name": "Reid H.A.S.", "AuthorID": "26435468500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Space and Climate Physics, University College"}}}
