All rights reserved.Do dopaminergic reward structures represent the expected utility of information similarly to a reward? Optimal experimental design models from Bayesian decision theory and statistics have proposed a theoretical framework for quantifying the expected value of information that might result from a query. In particular, this formulation quantifies the value of information before the answer to that query is known, in situations where payoffs are unknown and the goal is purely epistemic: That is, to increase knowledge about the state of the world. Whether and how such a theoretical quantity is represented in the brain is unknown. Here we use an event-related functional MRI (fMRI) task design to disentangle information expectation, information revelation and categorization outcome anticipation, and response-contingent reward processing in a visual probabilistic categorization task. We identify a neural signature corresponding to the expectation of information, involving the left lateral ventral striatum. Moreover, we show a temporal dissociation in the activation of different reward-related regions, including the nucleus accumbens, medial prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex, during information expectation versus reward-related processing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bayesian optimal experimental design (OED)", "Expected value of information", "FMRI", "Reward", "Ventral striatum"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anticipation, Psychological", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Motivation", "Reward", "Ventral Striatum", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087465864", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"21733418000": {"Name": "Filimon F.", "AuthorID": "21733418000", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Surrey"}, "55169673400": {"Name": "Nelson J.D.", "AuthorID": "55169673400", "AffiliationID": "60026562", "AffiliationName": "Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition, Max Planck Institute for Human Development"}, "57219695387": {"Name": "Sejnowski T.J.", "AuthorID": "57219695387", "AffiliationID": "60030612", "AffiliationName": "Temporal Dynamics of Learning Center, University of California San Diego"}, "7102792906": {"Name": "Cottrell G.W.", "AuthorID": "7102792906", "AffiliationID": "60121653, 60030612", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science Engineering Department, University of California San Diego"}, "7005050489": {"Name": "Sereno M.I.", "AuthorID": "7005050489", "AffiliationID": "60018926", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, San Diego State University"}}}
