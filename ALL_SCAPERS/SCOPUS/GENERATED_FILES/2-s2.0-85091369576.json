During ubiquitination, E3 ligases recognize target proteins and determine the topology of ubiquitin chains. Recruitment of E3 ligases to targets proteins under stress conditions including oxidative stress and their implication in cell death have not been systemically explored. In the present study, we characterized the role of TRIM32 as an E3 ligase in regulation of oxidative stress induced cell death. TRIM32 is ubiquitously expressed in cell lines of different origin and form cytoplasmic speckle like structures that transiently interact with mitochondria under oxidative stress conditions. The ectopic expression of TRIM32 sensitizes cell death induced by oxidative stress whereas TRIM32 knockdown shows a protective effect. The turnover of TRIM32 is enhanced during oxidative stress and its expression induces ROS generation, loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and decrease in complex-I activity. The pro-apoptotic effect was rescued by pan-caspase inhibitor or antioxidant treatment. E3 ligase activity of TRIM32 is essential for oxidative stress induced apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, TRIM32 decreases X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) level and overexpression of XIAP rescued cells from TRIM32 mediated oxidative stress and cell death. Overall, the results of this study provide the first evidence supporting the role of TRIM32 in regulating oxidative stress induced cell death, which has implications in numerous pathological conditions including cancer and neurodegeneration.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cell death", "Mitochondria", "Oxidative stress", "TRIM32", "ubiquitination", "XIAP"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091369576", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"55358830100": {"Name": "Prajapati P.", "AuthorID": "55358830100", "AffiliationID": "60015941", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience, University of Kentucky"}, "57201885433": {"Name": "Gohel D.", "AuthorID": "57201885433", "AffiliationID": "60002112", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, The M.S.
