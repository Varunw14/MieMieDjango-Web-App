Relevance is ambiguous, particularly over a schema-rich KG like DBpedia which supports a wide range of different semantics of relevance based on numerous types of relations and attributes. As users may lack the expertise to formalize the desired semantics, supervised methods have emerged to learn the hidden user-defined relevance from user-provided examples. Along this line, in this paper we propose a novel generative model over KGs for relevance search, named GREASE. The model applies to meta-path based relevance where a meta-path characterizes a particular type of semantics of relating the query entity to answer entities. It is also extended to support properties that constrain answer entities. Extensive experiments on two large-scale KGs demonstrate that GREASE has advanced the state of the art in effectiveness, expressiveness, and efficiency.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Generative model", "Knowledge graph", "Meta-path", "Relevance search"], "IndexKeywords": ["Generative model", "Knowledge graphs", "Meta-path", "Relevance search", "State of the art", "Supervised methods", "Support properties", "Types of relations"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079533822", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"57206472658": {"Name": "Zhou T.", "AuthorID": "57206472658", "AffiliationID": "60033100", "AffiliationName": "National Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University"}, "57206473931": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "57206473931", "AffiliationID": "60033100", "AffiliationName": "National Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University"}, "36103954800": {"Name": "Cheng G.", "AuthorID": "36103954800", "AffiliationID": "60033100", "AffiliationName": "National Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University"}, "57214934385": {"Name": "Wei Y.", "AuthorID": "57214934385", "AffiliationID": "60033100", "AffiliationName": "National Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University"}, "55902731900": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "55902731900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
