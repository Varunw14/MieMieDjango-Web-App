Published by Cambridge University Press.BackgroundEthnic minority groups in Western countries face an increased risk of psychotic disorders. Causes of this long-standing public health inequality remain poorly understood. We investigated whether social disadvantage, linguistic distance and discrimination contributed to these patterns.MethodsWe used case-control data from the EUropean network of national schizophrenia networks studying Gene-Environment Interactions (EU-GEI) study, carried out in 16 centres in six countries. We recruited 1130 cases and 1497 population-based controls. Our main outcome measure was first-episode ICD-10 psychotic disorder (F20-F33), and exposures were ethnicity (white majority, black, mixed, Asian, North-African, white minority and other), generational status, social disadvantage, linguistic distance and discrimination. Age, sex, paternal age, cannabis use, childhood trauma and parental history of psychosis were included as a priori confounders. Exposures and confounders were added sequentially to multivariable logistic models, following multiple imputation for missing data.ResultsParticipants from any ethnic minority background had crude excess odds of psychosis [odds ratio (OR) 2.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.69-2.43], which remained after adjustment for confounders (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.31-1.98). This was progressively attenuated following further adjustment for social disadvantage (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.22-1.89) and linguistic distance (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.95-1.57), a pattern mirrored in several specific ethnic groups. Linguistic distance and social disadvantage had stronger effects for first- A nd later-generation groups, respectively.ConclusionSocial disadvantage and linguistic distance, two potential markers of sociocultural exclusion, were associated with increased odds of psychotic disorder, and adjusting for these led to equivocal risk between several ethnic minority groups and the white majority.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Discrimination", "epidemiology", "ethnicity", "psychotic disorders", "social disadvantage"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081607960", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57200244360": {"Name": "Jongsma H.E.", "AuthorID": "57200244360", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge"}, "57218240440": {"Name": "Kirkbride J.B.", "AuthorID": "57218240440", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "PsyLife Group, Division of Psychiatry, UCL"}, "56489064900": {"Name": "Jones P.B.", "AuthorID": "56489064900", "AffiliationID": "60005210", "AffiliationName": "CAMEO Early Intervention Service, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough National Health Service Foundation Trust"}, "57202601716": {"Name": "Gayer-Anderson C.", "AuthorID": "57202601716", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Services and Population Research, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "55608671400": {"Name": "Morgan C.", "AuthorID": "55608671400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Services and Population Research, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "12762952600": {"Name": "Tarricone I.", "AuthorID": "12762952600", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Transcultural Psychosomatic Team (BoTPT), Department of Surgical and Medical Sciences, Bologna University"}, "57193569808": {"Name": "Velthorst E.", "AuthorID": "57193569808", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Early Psychosis Section, Department of Psychiatry, Amsterdam UMC, Location AMC"}, "7005592387": {"Name": "De Haan L.", "AuthorID": "7005592387", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Early Psychosis Section, Department of Psychiatry, Amsterdam UMC, Location AMC"}, "44861788000": {"Name": "Van Der Ven E.", "AuthorID": "44861788000", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology, School for Mental Health and Neuroscience, Maastricht University Medical Centre"}, "6603411181": {"Name": "Rutten B.P.", "AuthorID": "6603411181", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology, School for Mental Health and Neuroscience, Maastricht University Medical Centre"}, "7102358027": {"Name": "Van Os J.", "AuthorID": "7102358027", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Brain Center Rudolf Magnus, Utrecht University Medical Centre"}, "8900019500": {"Name": "Quattrone D.", "AuthorID": "8900019500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "10738849300": {"Name": "Di Forti M.", "AuthorID": "10738849300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "57219715244": {"Name": "Murray R.M.", "AuthorID": "57219715244", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7005549815": {"Name": "Menezes P.R.", "AuthorID": "7005549815", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Preventive Medicine, Faculdade de Medicina, University of Sa\u00f5 Paulo"}, "57204744667": {"Name": "Del-Ben C.M.", "AuthorID": "57204744667", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, Department of Neuroscience and Behaviour, Medical School, University of Sa\u00f5 Paulo"}, "6508338058": {"Name": "Arango C.", "AuthorID": "6508338058", "AffiliationID": "60104561", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red de Salud Mental"}, "57197687797": {"Name": "Lasalvia A.", "AuthorID": "57197687797", "AffiliationID": "112876462", "AffiliationName": "Section of Psychiatry, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integra di Verona"}, "57208023356": {"Name": "Berardi D.", "AuthorID": "57208023356", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical and Neuro-motor Sciences, Psychiatry Unit, Alma Mater Studiorum Universit\u00e0 di Bologna"}, "6601925392": {"Name": "La Cascia C.", "AuthorID": "6601925392", "AffiliationID": "105705902", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Psychiatry, 'P.
