Published by Cambridge University Press.BackgroundDaily use of high-potency cannabis has been reported to carry a high risk for developing a psychotic disorder. However, the evidence is mixed on whether any pattern of cannabis use is associated with a particular symptomatology in first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients.MethodWe analysed data from 901 FEP patients and 1235 controls recruited across six countries, as part of the European Network of National Schizophrenia Networks Studying Gene-Environment Interactions (EU-GEI) study. We used item response modelling to estimate two bifactor models, which included general and specific dimensions of psychotic symptoms in patients and psychotic experiences in controls. The associations between these dimensions and cannabis use were evaluated using linear mixed-effects models analyses.ResultsIn patients, there was a linear relationship between the positive symptom dimension and the extent of lifetime exposure to cannabis, with daily users of high-potency cannabis having the highest score (B = 0.35; 95% CI 0.14-0.56). Moreover, negative symptoms were more common among patients who never used cannabis compared with those with any pattern of use (B = -0.22; 95% CI -0.37 to -0.07). In controls, psychotic experiences were associated with current use of cannabis but not with the extent of lifetime use. Neither patients nor controls presented differences in depressive dimension related to cannabis use.ConclusionsOur findings provide the first large-scale evidence that FEP patients with a history of daily use of high-potency cannabis present with more positive and less negative symptoms, compared with those who never used cannabis or used low-potency types.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cannabis use", "cannabis-associated psychosis", "first episode psychosis", "psychopathology", "psychotic experiences", "symptom dimensions"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082692624", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"8900019500": {"Name": "Quattrone D.", "AuthorID": "8900019500", "AffiliationID": "60001972, 60005285, 60016908", "AffiliationName": "Medical Faculty Mannheim, Central Institute of Mental Health, University of Heidelberg"}, "55961024500": {"Name": "Vassos E.", "AuthorID": "55961024500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7402975073": {"Name": "Lewis C.M.", "AuthorID": "7402975073", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "10738849300": {"Name": "Di Forti M.", "AuthorID": "10738849300", "AffiliationID": "60028884, 60011520, 60171762, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, King's College London"}, "57219715244": {"Name": "Murray R.M.", "AuthorID": "57219715244", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "35796165100": {"Name": "Reininghaus U.", "AuthorID": "35796165100", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology, School for Mental Health and Neuroscience, S.
