All rights reserved.Purpose:To compare the survival of a first penetrating keratoplasty (PK) or endothelial keratoplasty (EK) for iridocorneal endothelial (ICE) syndrome with transplant survival in Fuchs endothelial dystrophy (FED) and pseudophakic bullous keratopathy (PBK).Methods:We compared graft survival of PK and EK for ICE syndrome for 2 time periods. We then compared graft survival in ICE syndrome with graft survival in FED and PBK. Kaplan-Meier estimates of graft survival up to 5 years posttransplant were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI), whereas comparisons between the groups were performed using the log-rank test.Results:We included 86 first transplants for ICE syndrome. There was no difference in graft survival between the 58 PKs and the 28 EKs for up to 5 years after surgery (P = 0.717). For the period from 2009 to 2017, the 5-year graft survival rates for ICE syndrome were 64.3% (CI, 21.8%-88.0%) for the 16 PKs and 66.8% (CI, 41.8%-83.0%) for the 26 EKs (P = 0.469). Between 2009 and 2017, the 5-year survival rate for 42 grafts with ICE syndrome was 62.7% (CI, 39.6%-79.0%), which was lower than 75.9% (CI, 74.2%-77.4%) in 7058 transplants for FED but higher than 55.1% (CI, 52.0%-58.0%) in 3320 transplants for PBK, although the numbers of ICE transplants are too small to tell whether this difference was by chance.Conclusions:The results indicate no difference in graft survival between PK and EK for ICE syndrome. Graft survival in ICE syndrome is intermediate between that of FED and PBK.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cornea", "iridocorneal endothelial syndrome", "keratoplasty"], "IndexKeywords": ["Descemet Stripping Endothelial Keratoplasty", "Endothelium, Corneal", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Fuchs' Endothelial Dystrophy", "Graft Rejection", "Graft Survival", "Humans", "Incidence", "Iridocorneal Endothelial Syndrome", "Keratoplasty, Penetrating", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Registries", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome", "United Kingdom", "Visual Acuity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075961129", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"56226551500": {"Name": "Rotenberg M.", "AuthorID": "56226551500", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7005642367": {"Name": "Larkin D.F.", "AuthorID": "7005642367", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7004454391": {"Name": "Tuft S.J.", "AuthorID": "7004454391", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "57212113425": {"Name": "Downward L.", "AuthorID": "57212113425", "AffiliationID": "60030968", "AffiliationName": "Statistics and Clinical Studies, NHS Blood and Transplant"}, "24922684600": {"Name": "Curnow E.", "AuthorID": "24922684600", "AffiliationID": "60030968", "AffiliationName": "Statistics and Clinical Studies, NHS Blood and Transplant"}}}
