We demonstrate that this conception of dependence conflates the structure of a dependency network, and the observations across this network. By disentangling these two elements we show, via mathematical proof and specific examples, that there are cases where dependencies yield an informational advantage over independence. More precisely, when a structural dependency exists, but observations are either partial or contradicting, these observations provide more support to a hypothesis than when this structural dependency does not exist, ceteris paribus. Furthermore, we show that lay reasoners endorse sufficient assumptions underpinning these advantageous structures yet fail to appreciate their implications for probability judgments and belief revision.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Belief updating", "Dependence", "Evidential reasoning", "Probabilistic reasoning", "Reliability"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086841613", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"56110120100": {"Name": "Pilditch T.D.", "AuthorID": "56110120100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6507379819": {"Name": "Lagnado D.", "AuthorID": "6507379819", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57205216629": {"Name": "Hahn U.", "AuthorID": "57205216629", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Birkbeck University of London"}, "7003719812": {"Name": "Fenton N.", "AuthorID": "7003719812", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University of London"}}}
