Children with Williams syndrome and Down syndrome are at higher risk of vision problems, and these are less likely to be detected due to diagnostic overshadowing and difficulty accessing eye-care. Education, Health and Care (EHC) plans are statutory documents, introduced by the Children and Families Act 2014 in England, with the intention of integrating provision across these domains. Vision issues should be reported in these plans, and recommendations made about appropriate adjustments for them. We analysed the EHC plans from 53 children with Down or Williams syndrome. Our results showed significant underreporting, especially for children with Williams syndrome, and little explanation of what adjustments should be made. We also report pockets of good practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Down syndrome", "Neurodevelopmental disorders", "Special educational needs", "Vision", "Williams syndrome"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083983333", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"57216585706": {"Name": "Harvey H.", "AuthorID": "57216585706", "AffiliationID": "121718943", "AffiliationName": "SeeAbility"}, "57201557313": {"Name": "Ashworth M.", "AuthorID": "57201557313", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Human Development, UCL Institute of Education"}, "14631196700": {"Name": "Van Herwegen J.", "AuthorID": "14631196700", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Human Development, UCL Institute of Education"}, "26031680000": {"Name": "Palikara O.", "AuthorID": "26031680000", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Education Studies, University of Warwick"}}}
