Computer-assisted planning (CAP) improves risk scores, gray matter sampling, orthogonal drilling angles to the skull and intracerebral length in a fraction of the time required for manual planning. Due to differences in planning practices, such algorithms may not be generalizable between institutions. We provide a prospective validation of clinically feasible trajectories using \u201cspatial priors\u201d derived from previous implantations and implement a machine learning classifier to adapt to evolving planning practices. Methods: Thirty-two patients underwent consecutive SEEG implantations utilizing computer-assisted planning over 2 years. Implanted electrodes from the first 12 patients (108 electrodes) were used as a training set from which entry and target point spatial priors were generated. CAP was then prospectively performed using the spatial priors in a further test set of 20 patients (210 electrodes). A K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) machine learning classifier was implemented as an adaptive learning method to modify the spatial priors dynamically. Results: All of the 318 prospective computer-assisted planned electrodes were implanted without complication. Spatial priors developed from the training set generated clinically feasible trajectories in 79% of the test set. The remaining 21% required entry or target points outside of the spatial priors. The K-NN classifier was able to dynamically model real-time changes in the spatial priors in order to adapt to the evolving planning requirements. Conclusions: We provide spatial priors for common SEEG trajectories that prospectively integrate clinically feasible trajectory planning practices from previous SEEG implantations. This allows institutional SEEG experience to be incorporated and used to guide future implantations. The deployment of a K-NN classifier may improve the generalisability of the algorithm by dynamically modifying the spatial priors in real-time as further implantations are performed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["computer-assisted planning", "epilepsy surgery", "EpiNav", "machine learning", "spatial priors", "stereoelectroencephalography"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088945774", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"54954062300": {"Name": "Vakharia V.N.", "AuthorID": "54954062300", "AffiliationID": "122111391", "AffiliationName": "Chalfont Centre for Epilepsy"}, "57215499053": {"Name": "Miserocchi A.", "AuthorID": "57215499053", "AffiliationID": "122111391", "AffiliationName": "Chalfont Centre for Epilepsy"}, "57204026204": {"Name": "McEvoy A.W.", "AuthorID": "57204026204", "AffiliationID": "122111391", "AffiliationName": "Chalfont Centre for Epilepsy"}, "57215026527": {"Name": "Duncan J.S.", "AuthorID": "57215026527", "AffiliationID": "122111391", "AffiliationName": "Chalfont Centre for Epilepsy"}, "57219298090": {"Name": "Sparks R.E.", "AuthorID": "57219298090", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "55195507900": {"Name": "Granados A.", "AuthorID": "55195507900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}}}
