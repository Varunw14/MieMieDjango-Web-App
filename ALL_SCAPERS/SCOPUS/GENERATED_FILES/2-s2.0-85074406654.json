Currently available schemes have only modest prognostic accuracy. The TRA2\u00b0P score aids in vascular risk stratification in patients with previous myocardial infarction (MI). Aim: We investigated whether the prognostic performance of TRA2\u00b0P can be extended in patients with ischemic stroke and whether it can improve the risk stratification made by CHA2DS2VASc and Essen-Stroke-Risk-Score (ESRS). Methods: We analyzed the Athens Stroke Registry using Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox-regression analyses to assess if TRA2\u00b0P (in different categorizations) predicts the composite endpoint of stroke recurrence, MI or cardiovascular death. We compared its incremental predictive value over CHA2DS2-VASc and ESRS and calculated continuous net reclassification indices (cNRI). Results: In 2833 patients (followed for 9278 patient-years) and 776 events, there was decreased survival probability for TRA2\u00b0P-based high-risk patients compared to low-risk (log-rank-test P < .001), but the discriminatory power for the occurrence of the composite endpoint was only modest (Harrell's-C:.566, 95% CI:.545-.587). Combined with ESRS, TRA2\u00b0P conferred incremental discrimination (Harrell's-C:.544, 95% CI:.513-.574 versus .574, 95% CI:.543-.605 respectively, P = .049) and reclassification value (cNRI = 9.8%, P = .02). Combined with CHA2DS2-VASc, TRA2\u00b0P did not improve discrimination (Harell's-C:.578, 95% CI: .547-.608 versus .585, 95% CI:.554-.616, P = .738). Conclusion: The currently available prognostic scores have generally low performance to predict the overall cardiovascular risk in ischemic stroke patients. Further research is needed to improve vascular risk stratification in ischemic stroke patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CHA2DS2-VASc", "Essen-Stroke-Risk-Score", "Risk stratification", "TRA2\u00b0P"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Brain Ischemia", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Cause of Death", "Decision Support Techniques", "Female", "Greece", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prognosis", "Prospective Studies", "Registries", "Reproducibility of Results", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Stroke", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074406654", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Rehabilitation", "MEDI", "2742"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57188877741": {"Name": "Georgiopoulos G.", "AuthorID": "57188877741", "AffiliationID": "60028900, 60031258", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Therapeutics, Alexandra Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "6602464098": {"Name": "Stamatelopoulos K.", "AuthorID": "6602464098", "AffiliationID": "60028900, 60031258", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Therapeutics, Alexandra Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "6701353378": {"Name": "Manios E.", "AuthorID": "6701353378", "AffiliationID": "60028900, 60031258", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Therapeutics, Alexandra Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "16426036800": {"Name": "Ntaios G.", "AuthorID": "16426036800", "AffiliationID": "60025812", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, University of Thessaly"}, "57188640319": {"Name": "Korompoki E.", "AuthorID": "57188640319", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "First Department of Neurology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "57212059516": {"Name": "Vemmou E.", "AuthorID": "57212059516", "AffiliationID": "105397034", "AffiliationName": "Hellenic Cardiovascular Research Society"}, "7003501172": {"Name": "Vemmos K.", "AuthorID": "7003501172", "AffiliationID": "105397034", "AffiliationName": "Hellenic Cardiovascular Research Society"}, "7004193512": {"Name": "Milionis H.", "AuthorID": "7004193512", "AffiliationID": "60029082", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, University of Ioannina Medical School"}, "57210724180": {"Name": "Masi S.", "AuthorID": "57210724180", "AffiliationID": "60028868", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Universit\u00e0 di Pisa"}, "57216675273": {"Name": "Lip G.Y.H.", "AuthorID": "57216675273", "AffiliationID": "60022134", "AffiliationName": "Aalborg Thrombosis Research Unit, Department of Clinical Medicine, Aalborg University"}}}
