In this study, we examined relations between WMH load and distribution, amyloid pathology and vascular risk in 339 controls and cases with either subjective (SCD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Regional deep (DWMH) and periventricular (PWMH) WMH loads were determined using an automated algorithm. We stratified on A\u03b21-42 pathology (A\u03b2+/\u2212) and analyzed group differences, as well as associations with Framingham Risk Score for cardiovascular disease (FRS-CVD) and age. Occipital PWMH (p = 0.001) and occipital DWMH (p = 0.003) loads were increased in SCD-A\u03b2+ compared with A\u03b2\u2212 controls. In MCI-A\u03b2+ compared with A\u03b2\u2212 controls, there were differences in global WMH (p = 0.003), as well as occipital DWMH (p = 0.001) and temporal DWMH (p = 0.002) loads. FRS-CVD was associated with frontal PWMHs (p = 0.003) and frontal DWMHs (p = 0.005), after adjusting for age. There were associations between global and all regional WMH loads and age. In summary, posterior WMH loads were increased in SCD-A\u03b2+ and MCI-A\u03b2+ cases, whereas frontal WMHs were associated with vascular risk. The differences in WMH topography support the use of regional WMH load as an early-stage marker of etiology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s", "cerebrospinal fluid", "cognitive impairment/decline", "small vessel disease", "white matter disease"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091303539", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57195545908": {"Name": "P\u00e5lhaugen L.", "AuthorID": "57195545908", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo"}, "57195542863": {"Name": "Tecelao S.", "AuthorID": "57195542863", "AffiliationID": "60068728", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Akershus University Hospital"}, "56222844000": {"Name": "Aarsland D.", "AuthorID": "56222844000", "AffiliationID": "60069103", "AffiliationName": "Center for Age-Related Diseases, Stavanger University Hospital"}, "36814445900": {"Name": "Selnes P.", "AuthorID": "36814445900", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo"}, "57211101142": {"Name": "Fladby T.", "AuthorID": "57211101142", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo"}, "56667713500": {"Name": "Almdahl I.S.", "AuthorID": "56667713500", "AffiliationID": "60105037", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geriatric Psychiatry, Oslo University Hospital"}, "57192425345": {"Name": "Kalheim L.F.", "AuthorID": "57192425345", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo"}, "56198868700": {"Name": "Sudre C.H.", "AuthorID": "56198868700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics, University College London"}, "57204636980": {"Name": "Cardoso M.J.", "AuthorID": "57204636980", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics, University College London"}, "57195546676": {"Name": "Nakling A.", "AuthorID": "57195546676", "AffiliationID": "100540950", "AffiliationName": "Betanien Hospital"}, "24556172800": {"Name": "Johnsen S.H.", "AuthorID": "24556172800", "AffiliationID": "60021255", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Medicine, Brain and Circulation Research Group, UiT The Arctic University of Norway"}, "13907592500": {"Name": "Rongve A.", "AuthorID": "13907592500", "AffiliationID": "60029622", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Medicine (K1), University of Bergen"}, "55883109200": {"Name": "Bj\u00f8rnerud A.", "AuthorID": "55883109200", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Oslo"}}}
