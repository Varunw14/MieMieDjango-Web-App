However, studies on this important serotype have been hampered by the inability to genetically modify these strains. In this study we have genetically modified a serotype 1 strain (519/43), the first time that this has been achieved for this serotype, providing the methodology for a deeper understanding of its biology and pathogenicity. As proof of principle we constructed a defined pneumolysin mutant and showed that it lost its ability to lyse red blood cells. We also showed that when mice were infected intranasally with the mutant 519/43\u0394ply there was no significant difference between the load of bacteria in lungs and blood when compared to the wild type 519/43. When mice were infected intraperitoneally there were significantly fewer bacteria recovered from blood for the mutant 519/43\u0394ply strain, although all mice still displayed signs of disease. Our study demonstrates S. pneumoniae serotype 1 strains can be genetically manipulated using our methodology and demonstrate that the ability to cause pneumonia in mice is independent of active pneumolysin for the 519/43 serotype 1 strain.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Haemolysis", "Mutagenesis", "Pneumolysin", "S. pneumoniae", "Serotype 1"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078656384", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"35082757900": {"Name": "Terra V.S.", "AuthorID": "35082757900", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection Biology, Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7101805466": {"Name": "Wren B.W.", "AuthorID": "7101805466", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection Biology, Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "55314220700": {"Name": "Plumptre C.D.", "AuthorID": "55314220700", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Inflammation and Tissue Repair, Department of Medicine, Royal Free and University College Medical School, Rayne Institute"}, "35553480100": {"Name": "Brown J.S.", "AuthorID": "35553480100", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Inflammation and Tissue Repair, Department of Medicine, Royal Free and University College Medical School, Rayne Institute"}, "25655543600": {"Name": "Wall E.C.", "AuthorID": "25655543600", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity"}}}
