Methods: Individually linked health data in Denmark (2000\u22122012), Finland (2005\u20132014), Iceland (2004\u20132017), Norway (2005\u20132015), Sweden (2006\u20132015), Germany (2006\u20132015), Australia (New South Wales, 2004\u20132012), Hong Kong (2001\u20132015), UK (2006\u20132016), and the US (Medicaid, 2000\u20132013, and IBM MarketScan, 2012\u20132015) were used. Using a uniformed approach, we estimated the prevalence of antipsychotic use as the proportion of pregnancies where a woman filled at least one antipsychotic prescription within three months before pregnancy until birth. For the Nordic countries, data were meta-analyzed to investigate maternal characteristics associated with the use of antipsychotics. Results: We included 8,394,343 pregnancies. Typical antipsychotic use was highest in the UK (4.4%) whereas atypical antipsychotic use was highest in the US Medicaid (1.5%). Atypical antipsychotic use increased over time in most populations, reaching 2% in Australia (2012) and US Medicaid (2013). In most countries, prochlorperazine was the most commonly used typical antipsychotic and quetiapine the most commonly used atypical antipsychotic. Use of antipsychotics decreased across the trimesters of pregnancy in all populations except Finland. Antipsychotic use was elevated among smokers and those with parity \u22654 in the Nordic countries. Conclusion: Antipsychotic use during pregnancy varied considerably between populations, partly explained by varying use of the typical antipsychotic prochlorperazine, which is often used for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy. Increasing usage of atypical antipsychotics among pregnant women reflects the pattern that was previously reported for the general population.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antipsychotics", "Drug utilization study", "Epidemiology", "Pharmacological treatment", "Pregnancy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083005998", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"16835448900": {"Name": "Reutfors J.", "AuthorID": "16835448900", "AffiliationID": "60012311, 60080973", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Pharmacoepidemiology, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska Institutet"}, "57194733808": {"Name": "Cesta C.E.", "AuthorID": "57194733808", "AffiliationID": "60012311, 60080973", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Pharmacoepidemiology, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska Institutet"}, "57200443676": {"Name": "Pazzagli L.", "AuthorID": "57200443676", "AffiliationID": "60012311, 60080973", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Pharmacoepidemiology, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska Institutet"}, "55418970200": {"Name": "Br\u00f6ms G.", "AuthorID": "55418970200", "AffiliationID": "60026150", "AffiliationName": "Internal Medicine, Danderyd Hospital"}, "7410007973": {"Name": "Cohen J.M.", "AuthorID": "7410007973", "AffiliationID": "60011916", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chronic Diseases and Ageing, Norwegian Institute of Public Health"}, "7003614018": {"Name": "Engeland A.", "AuthorID": "7003614018", "AffiliationID": "60029622", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Public Health and Primary Care, University of Bergen"}, "6602279640": {"Name": "Furu K.", "AuthorID": "6602279640", "AffiliationID": "60011916", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chronic Diseases and Ageing, Norwegian Institute of Public Health"}, "21739510300": {"Name": "Karlstad \u00d8.", "AuthorID": "21739510300", "AffiliationID": "60011916", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chronic Diseases and Ageing, Norwegian Institute of Public Health"}, "7006113804": {"Name": "Bateman B.T.", "AuthorID": "7006113804", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60016782", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative, and Pain Medicine, Brigham and Women's, Harvard Medical School"}, "6603369021": {"Name": "Huybrechts K.F.", "AuthorID": "6603369021", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School"}, "54384760200": {"Name": "Brauer R.", "AuthorID": "54384760200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Practice and Policy, School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "55883514900": {"Name": "Man K.K.C.", "AuthorID": "55883514900", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Erasmus University Medical Centre"}, "57204678291": {"Name": "Wang Z.", "AuthorID": "57204678291", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Practice and Policy, School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "12774836400": {"Name": "Einarsd\u00f3ttir K.", "AuthorID": "12774836400", "AffiliationID": "60071113", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Public Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Iceland"}, "23491093000": {"Name": "Zoega H.", "AuthorID": "23491093000", "AffiliationID": "60011463, 60028333", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Big Data Research in Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW"}, "7006446486": {"Name": "Gissler M.", "AuthorID": "7006446486", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Division of Family Medicine and Primary Care, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet"}, "24587493700": {"Name": "Leinonen M.K.", "AuthorID": "24587493700", "AffiliationID": "110150203", "AffiliationName": "Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare"}, "8396094300": {"Name": "Havard A.", "AuthorID": "8396094300", "AffiliationID": "60011463, 60028333", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Big Data Research in Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW"}, "56004188500": {"Name": "Schaffer A.", "AuthorID": "56004188500", "AffiliationID": "60011463, 60028333", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Big Data Research in Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW"}, "56639580500": {"Name": "Hernandez-Diaz S.", "AuthorID": "56639580500", "AffiliationID": "60032499", "AffiliationName": "Harvard T.H.
