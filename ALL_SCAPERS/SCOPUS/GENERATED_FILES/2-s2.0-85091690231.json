The material exhibits a high porosity (surface area 326 m2 g\u22121 and total pores volume 0.484 cm3 g\u22121) and heterogeneous surface chemistry. In the used LPHF-US synthetic protocol, the energy-demanding calcination step leading to crystallization is eliminated and an organic residue is simultaneously grafted to the surface. That organic residue affects the anatase nanocrystals, size (4\u20137 nm), which are embedded in an amorphous titanium hydroxide network. This nanomaterial shows superior performance as a heterogenous photocatalyst either in a gaseous phase by decomposing toxic vapors of chemical warfare agents (a mustard-gas surrogate), or in a liquid phase by selectively oxidizing benzyl alcohol, a model lignin-biomass-derived compound. The grafted organic phase enhances the catalyst's photoreactivity under visible light, by acting as a photosensitizer (antenna effect) and/or as a source of chromophores.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biomass valorization", "chemical warfare agents", "heterogeneous photocatalysis", "organic phase grafted titanium oxide nanoparticles", "ultrasound assisted synthesis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anatase nanocrystals", "Chemical warfare agents", "Heterogeneous surface", "High frequency HF", "Organic functionalities", "Precipitation synthesis", "Synthetic protocols", "Titanium hydroxides"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091690231", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57193516842": {"Name": "Giannakoudakis D.A.", "AuthorID": "57193516842", "AffiliationID": "60028458", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, The City College of New York"}, "57219205104": {"Name": "Qayyum A.", "AuthorID": "57219205104", "AffiliationID": "60014383, 60030078", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physical Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "6602077174": {"Name": "\u0141omot D.", "AuthorID": "6602077174", "AffiliationID": "60014383, 60030078", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physical Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "8707096900": {"Name": "Lisovytskiy D.", "AuthorID": "8707096900", "AffiliationID": "60014383, 60030078", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physical Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "13405955400": {"Name": "Colmenares J.C.", "AuthorID": "13405955400", "AffiliationID": "60014383, 60030078", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physical Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "57211733437": {"Name": "Bandosz T.J.", "AuthorID": "57211733437", "AffiliationID": "60028458", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, The City College of New York"}, "55372475000": {"Name": "Besenhard M.O.", "AuthorID": "55372475000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
