To achieve this goal, chemists traditionally choose the correct starting materials and reaction conditions, but it often lacks selectivity and efficiency. A promising alternative is to design laser control schemes and apply them to guide and control chemical reactions. This mini-review attempts to provide theoretical insight into the laser-induced control of chemical reactions by highlighting some recent achievements, discussing the present challenges, and shedding some light on future prospects.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094949108", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"56047407500": {"Name": "Dey D.", "AuthorID": "56047407500", "AffiliationID": "60103615", "AffiliationName": "Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata, Department of Chemical Sciences"}, "57168662300": {"Name": "Tiwari A.K.", "AuthorID": "57168662300", "AffiliationID": "60103615", "AffiliationName": "Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata, Department of Chemical Sciences"}}}
