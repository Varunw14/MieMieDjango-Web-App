All rights reserved.Peptide biosynthesis is performed by ribosomes and several other classes of enzymes, but a simple chemical synthesis may have created the first peptides at the origins of life. a-Aminonitriles\u2014prebiotic a\u2013amino acid precursors\u2014are generally produced by Strecker reactions. However, cysteine\u2019s aminothiol is incompatible with nitriles. Consequently, cysteine nitrile is not stable, and cysteine has been proposed to be a product of evolution, not prebiotic chemistry. We now report a high-yielding, prebiotic synthesis of cysteine peptides. Our biomimetic pathway converts serine to cysteine by nitrile-activated dehydroalanine synthesis. We also demonstrate that N-acylcysteines catalyze peptide ligation, directly coupling kinetically stable\u2014but energy-rich\u2014a-amidonitriles to proteinogenic amines. This rare example of selective and efficient organocatalysis in water implicates cysteine as both catalyst and precursor in prebiotic peptide synthesis.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alanine", "Catalysis", "Cysteine", "Kinetics", "Nitriles", "Origin of Life", "Peptides", "Serine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096082235", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57219920916": {"Name": "Foden C.S.", "AuthorID": "57219920916", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57213340326": {"Name": "Islam S.", "AuthorID": "57213340326", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57191518996": {"Name": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Garc\u00eda C.", "AuthorID": "57191518996", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55767078500": {"Name": "Maugeri L.", "AuthorID": "55767078500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7006813758": {"Name": "Sheppard T.D.", "AuthorID": "7006813758", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "14631029600": {"Name": "Powner M.W.", "AuthorID": "14631029600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
