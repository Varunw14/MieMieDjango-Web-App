Areas covered: In view of the recent knowledge, changes in nutritional and physical activity habits ameliorate glycemic control during pregnancy and in turn improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes. Recently, a series of small clinical and experimental studies indicated that supplemenation with inositols, a family of insulin sensitizers, was associated with beneficial impact for both GDM and NTDs. Expert opinion: Herein, we discuss the most significant scientific evidence supporting myo-inositol administration as a prophylaxis for the above-mentioned conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["D-chiro-inositol (DCI)", "gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)", "insulin resistance", "myo-inositol (MI)", "neural tube defects (NTDs)", "prevention"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096148347", "SubjectAreas": [["Toxicology", "PHAR", "3005"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"7101668012": {"Name": "Facchinetti F.", "AuthorID": "7101668012", "AffiliationID": "60004591", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Mother-Infant Department, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia"}, "8660280400": {"Name": "Cavalli P.", "AuthorID": "8660280400", "AffiliationID": "105994625", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Genetics, ASST - Bergamo Est"}, "7006634311": {"Name": "Copp A.J.", "AuthorID": "7006634311", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Newlife Birth Defects Research Centre and Developmental Biology & Cancer Research and Teaching Department, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "35587452100": {"Name": "Greene N.D.E.", "AuthorID": "35587452100", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Newlife Birth Defects Research Centre and Developmental Biology & Cancer Research and Teaching Department, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57188973166": {"Name": "D\u2019Anna R.", "AuthorID": "57188973166", "AffiliationID": "60011576", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Pathology, University of Messina"}, "22953321900": {"Name": "Kandaraki E.", "AuthorID": "22953321900", "AffiliationID": "60029813", "AffiliationName": "Department of Endocrinology & Diabetes, HYGEIA Hospital"}, "6701839229": {"Name": "Unfer V.", "AuthorID": "6701839229", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": "125427802", "AffiliationName": "The Experts Group on Inositol in Basic and Clinical Research"}}}
