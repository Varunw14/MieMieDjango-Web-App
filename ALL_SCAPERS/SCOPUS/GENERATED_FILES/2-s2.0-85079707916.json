However, many authors have observed that a transitional behaviour occurs in certain granular intermediate soils in which the fines content and the initial void ratio have a significant effect on the location of this line. This work investigates these effects in poorly graded granular soils as previous studies reported that this type of soil does not exhibit transitional behaviour. Results from this study reveal that poorly graded fine-grained sand exhibits transitional behaviour similar to that of intermediate soils, and subsequently, it can be grouped into ranges of initial densities in which each group approaches a unique CSL in v:lnp\u2019 space. A unique state boundary surface is identified by determining the critical state parameters from each group and using these parameters to normalise the stress paths; this shows that the critical state framework can be successfully applied to this type of soil.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fabric/structure of soil", "Laboratory test", "Sand"], "IndexKeywords": ["Critical state behaviour", "Critical state lines", "Fabric/structure of soils", "Fine-grained sand", "Initial density", "Initial void ratios", "Laboratory test", "State boundary surface"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079707916", "SubjectAreas": [["Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology", "EART", "1909"]], "AuthorData": {"57208404609": {"Name": "Ekinci A.", "AuthorID": "57208404609", "AffiliationID": "60004305", "AffiliationName": "Civil Engineering Program, Middle East Technical University"}, "57215022350": {"Name": "Hanafi M.", "AuthorID": "57215022350", "AffiliationID": "60012620", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Engineering, European University of Lefke"}, "57200769511": {"Name": "Ferreira P.M.V.", "AuthorID": "57200769511", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
