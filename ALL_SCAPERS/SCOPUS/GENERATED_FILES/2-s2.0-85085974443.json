This article responds to issues raised by Alice Sullivan concerning how the UK 2021 census will ask about sex and gender. The two-centuries-old question about male/female sex is not ideal, even with the new guidance proposed; however, I will argue that the proposed changes are unlikely to cause harm. The new open-ended census question on gender identity is welcome and will yield important data. I also respond to Sullivan\u2018s worries that \u201cqueer postmodernists\u201d are \u201ccoming for\u201d questionnaires and threaten the sanctity of scientific fact. Sullivan misrepresents trans-inclusive gender theories and how scientific research explaining sex/gender differences is carried out. Finally, I discuss how questioning the ontological reality of trans gender identities leads to transphobic harassment and worse.", "AuthorKeywords": ["gender identity", "sex", "UK census"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085974443", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"8923645900": {"Name": "Fugard A.", "AuthorID": "8923645900", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosocial Studies, Birkbeck, University of London"}}}
