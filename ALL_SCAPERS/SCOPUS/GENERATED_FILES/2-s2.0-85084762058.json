The combustible nature of timber suggests that the current models and correlations for compartment fire dynamics might not apply to compartments with timber boundaries, due to the increased fuel load and its redistribution across the compartment. In order to fill this knowledge gap, 24 medium-scale timber compartments have been carried out to characterise the fire dynamics when timber members are present. This experimental campaign provides data about the gas-phase temperatures, the flow fields at the opening, the burning behaviour of timber and its contribution to the total heat release rate. This data is then compared to Thomas and Heselden (1972) [1] compartment fire framework that predicts the fire development in conventional compartments. This comparison highlights the limitations of this framework, and the subsequent analysis proposes several changes to include the effect of burning timber elements. It is concluded that gas flow velocities increase with the amount of timber present in the compartment. Therefore, the fire transitions to a new regime where the gases do not have enough time to mix and react inside the compartment, the temperatures decrease and the horizontal velocities at the opening increase.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Compartment fires", "Heat release rate", "Timber buildings"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084762058", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57202393743": {"Name": "Gorska C.", "AuthorID": "57202393743", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "The University of Queensland"}, "56903753000": {"Name": "Hidalgo J.P.", "AuthorID": "56903753000", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "The University of Queensland"}, "7004558676": {"Name": "Torero J.L.", "AuthorID": "7004558676", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
