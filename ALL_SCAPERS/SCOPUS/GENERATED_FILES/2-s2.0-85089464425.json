In current reports, researchers indicate that acute symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection is relatively rare and much less severe than in adults. This case highlights that infection can be associated with life-threatening pulmonary disease in young infants and that infection can follow a similar disease course to that described in adults. We provide first data on the use of the novel antiviral remdesivir in a young child and an innovative approach to expedited approval from a multidisciplinary clinical team and bioethics committee for compassionate access to the drug.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adenosine Monophosphate", "Alanine", "Antiviral Agents", "Coronavirus Infections", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Premature", "Intensive Care Units", "Intubation, Intratracheal", "Pandemics", "Patient Discharge", "Pneumonia, Viral", "Radiography, Thoracic", "Respiration, Artificial", "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089464425", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"23495816600": {"Name": "Frauenfelder C.", "AuthorID": "23495816600", "AffiliationID": "60189793, 60009512", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery, Adelaide Medical School, University of Adelaide"}, "9534200900": {"Name": "Brierley J.", "AuthorID": "9534200900", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children National Health Service Foundation Trust"}, "57188933411": {"Name": "Perucca G.", "AuthorID": "57188933411", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children National Health Service Foundation Trust"}, "36022352400": {"Name": "Bamford A.", "AuthorID": "36022352400", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Infectious Diseases, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24470545300": {"Name": "Whittaker E.", "AuthorID": "24470545300", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Infectious Diseases, Imperial College Healthcare National Health Service Trust"}}}
