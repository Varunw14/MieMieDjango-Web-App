The quality of a project affects the trust in the platform, and therefore the value of the digital tokens exchanged over it. In this paper, we investigate whether developers\u2019 emotions can effectively provide insights that can improve the prediction of the price of tokens. We consider developers\u2019 comments and activity for two major blockchain projects, namely Ethereum and Bitcoin, extracted from Github. We measure sentiment and emotions (joy, love, anger, etc.) of the developers\u2019 comments over time, and test the corresponding time series (i.e. the affect time series) for correlations and causality with the Bitcoin/Ethereum time series of prices. Our analysis shows the existence of a Granger-causality between the time series of developers\u2019 emotions and Bitcoin/Ethereum price. Moreover, using an artificial recurrent neural network (LSTM), we can show that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)\u2014associated with the prediction of the prices of cryptocurrencies\u2014significantly decreases when including the affect time series.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blockchain", "Data mining", "Open source software development"], "IndexKeywords": ["Development practices", "Digital tokens", "Granger Causality", "Open source projects", "Root mean square errors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088451943", "SubjectAreas": [["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"]], "AuthorData": {"57215691088": {"Name": "Bartolucci S.", "AuthorID": "57215691088", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies"}, "55303609700": {"Name": "Destefanis G.", "AuthorID": "55303609700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies"}, "56313321800": {"Name": "Ortu M.", "AuthorID": "56313321800", "AffiliationID": "60032259", "AffiliationName": "DIEE, University of Cagliari"}, "57218249645": {"Name": "Uras N.", "AuthorID": "57218249645", "AffiliationID": "60032259", "AffiliationName": "DMI, University of Cagliari"}, "7005947166": {"Name": "Marchesi M.", "AuthorID": "7005947166", "AffiliationID": "60032259", "AffiliationName": "DMI, University of Cagliari"}, "7004058057": {"Name": "Tonelli R.", "AuthorID": "7004058057", "AffiliationID": "60032259", "AffiliationName": "DMI, University of Cagliari"}}}
