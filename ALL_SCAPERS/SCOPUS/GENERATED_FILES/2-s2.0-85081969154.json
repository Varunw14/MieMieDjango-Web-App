The collective FG Nup behavior has long been conceptualized either as a polymer brush, dominated by entropic and excluded-volume (repulsive) interactions, or as a hydrogel, dominated by cohesive (attractive) interactions between FG Nups. Here we compare mesoscale computational simulations with a wide range of experimental data to demonstrate that FG Nups are at the crossover point between these two regimes. Specifically, we find that repulsive and attractive interactions are balanced, resulting in morphologies and dynamics that are close to those of ideal polymer chains. We demonstrate that this property of FG Nups yields sufficient cohesion to seal the transport barrier, and yet maintains fast dynamics at the molecular scale, permitting the rapid polymer rearrangements needed for transport events.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Attractive interactions", "Computational simulation", "Crossover points", "Nuclear pore complexes", "Polymer morphology", "Selective barriers", "Transport barrier", "Transport events", "Intrinsically Disordered Proteins", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins", "Protein Conformation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081969154", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57200962097": {"Name": "Davis L.K.", "AuthorID": "57200962097", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for the Physics of Living Systems, University College London"}, "57203260116": {"Name": "Ford I.J.", "AuthorID": "57203260116", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "6701845862": {"Name": "Hoogenboom B.W.", "AuthorID": "6701845862", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for the Physics of Living Systems, University College London"}, "23669259400": {"Name": "\u0160ari\u0107 A.D.S.", "AuthorID": "23669259400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for the Physics of Living Systems, University College London"}}}
