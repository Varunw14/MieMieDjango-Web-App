Using frequentist and Bayesian analyses, Study 1 (N = 1,676), launched within days of the attacks, found that compared to a control condition, the interventions did not significantly improve intergroup attitudes. Instead, the data showed strong support of the null hypotheses that there were no intervention effects. Proximity to the attacks did not moderate the effect. Study 2 (N = 285) reexamined the effects of the three interventions 2.5 years after the attacks, generally replicating the pattern of findings in Study 1. Together, this research highlights the challenge of intergroup bias reduction following terror attacks. We conclude by discussing several recommendations for how psychological interventions could play a more impactful role in contexts of heightened conflict.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dissonance induction", "intergroup attitudes", "secure attachment", "self-affirmation", "terrorism"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081980144", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"56001546100": {"Name": "Van Assche J.", "AuthorID": "56001546100", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Center for Social and Cultural Psychology, University of Leuven"}, "57215023384": {"Name": "Dierckx K.", "AuthorID": "57215023384", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Developmental, Personality and Social Psychology, Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, Ghent University"}, "56682813600": {"Name": "Bostyn D.", "AuthorID": "56682813600", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Developmental, Personality and Social Psychology, Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, Ghent University"}, "24177414200": {"Name": "Noor M.", "AuthorID": "24177414200", "AffiliationID": "60030210", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Keele University"}, "25321039000": {"Name": "Saleem M.", "AuthorID": "25321039000", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Social Research, University of Michigan"}, "56656607800": {"Name": "Bouchat P.", "AuthorID": "56656607800", "AffiliationID": "60000145", "AffiliationName": "Center for Social and Cultural Psychology, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles"}, "57194473229": {"Name": "de Guissme L.", "AuthorID": "57194473229", "AffiliationID": "60000145", "AffiliationName": "Center for Social and Cultural Psychology, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles"}, "57200604239": {"Name": "Carew M.", "AuthorID": "57200604239", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Leonard Cheshire Disability and Inclusive Development Centre, University College London"}, "36815900400": {"Name": "Ernst-Vintila A.", "AuthorID": "36815900400", "AffiliationID": "60017338", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire Parisien de Psychologie Sociale, Universit\u00e9 Paris Ouest Nanterre La D\u00e9fense"}, "15841756200": {"Name": "Chao M.M.", "AuthorID": "15841756200", "AffiliationID": "60008592", "AffiliationName": "Department of Management, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"}}}
