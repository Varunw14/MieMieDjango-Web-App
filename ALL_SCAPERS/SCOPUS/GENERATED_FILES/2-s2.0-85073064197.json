The American Astronomical Society.Stealth coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are eruptions from the Sun that have no obvious low coronal signature. These CMEs are characteristically slower events but can still be geoeffective and affect space weather at Earth. Therefore, understanding the science underpinning these eruptions will greatly improve our ability to detect and, eventually, forecast them. We present a study of two stealth CMEs analyzed using advanced image processing techniques that reveal their faint signatures in observations from the extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) imagers on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, Solar Dynamics Observatory, and Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory spacecraft. The different viewpoints given by these spacecraft provide the opportunity to study each eruption from above and the side contemporaneously. For each event, EUV and magnetogram observations were combined to reveal the coronal structure that erupted. For one event, the observations indicate the presence of a magnetic flux rope before the CME's fast-rise phase. We found that both events originated in active regions and are likely to be sympathetic CMEs triggered by a nearby eruption. We discuss the physical processes that occurred in the time leading up to the onset of each stealth CME and conclude that these eruptions are part of the low-energy and velocity tail of a distribution of CME events and are not a distinct phenomenon.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Sun: activity", "Sun: corona", "Sun: coronal mass ejections (CMEs)", "Sun: magnetic fields"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073064197", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57211232299": {"Name": "O'Kane J.", "AuthorID": "57211232299", "AffiliationID": "60084281", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, UCL"}, "7401917508": {"Name": "Green L.", "AuthorID": "7401917508", "AffiliationID": "60084281", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, UCL"}, "57211231301": {"Name": "Long D.M.", "AuthorID": "57211231301", "AffiliationID": "60084281", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, UCL"}, "26435468500": {"Name": "Reid H.", "AuthorID": "26435468500", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "SUPA School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Glasgow"}}}
