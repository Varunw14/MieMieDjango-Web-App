The study of rainbow subgraphs goes back more than two hundred years to the work of Euler on Latin squares. Since then rainbow structures have been the focus of extensive research and have found applications in the areas of graph labelling and decomposition. An edge-colouring is locally k-bounded if each vertex is contained in at most k edges of the same colour. In this paper we prove that any such edge-colouring of the complete graph Kn contains a rainbow copy of every tree with at most (1 - o(1))n/k vertices. As a locally k-bounded edge-colouring of Kn may have only (n - 1)/k distinct colours, this is essentially tight. As a corollary of this result we obtain asymptotic versions of two long-standing conjectures in graph theory. Firstly, we prove an asymptotic version of Ringel\u2019s conjecture from 1963, showing that any n-edge tree packs into the complete graph K2n+o(n) to cover all but o(n2) of its edges. Secondly, we show that all trees have an almost-harmonious labelling. The existence of such a labelling was conjectured by Graham and Sloane in 1980. We also discuss some additional applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Graph decomposition", "Graph labeling", "Rainbow subgraphs", "Trees"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092790109", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"56559380400": {"Name": "Montgomery R.", "AuthorID": "56559380400", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics, University of Birmingham"}, "37087562400": {"Name": "Pokrovskiy A.", "AuthorID": "37087562400", "AffiliationID": "60009016, 60033387", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, Mathematics, and Statistics, Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "35553760600": {"Name": "Sudakov B.", "AuthorID": "35553760600", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, ETH"}}}
