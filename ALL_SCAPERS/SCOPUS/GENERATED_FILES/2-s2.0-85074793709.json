Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc on behalf of American Neurological Association.Objective: Intrathecal inflammation, compartmentalized in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in meningeal infiltrates, has fundamental role in inflammation, demyelination, and neuronal injury in cerebral cortex in multiple sclerosis (MS). Since the exact link between intrathecal inflammation and mechanisms of cortical pathology remains unknown, we aimed to investigate a detailed proteomic CSF profiling which is able to reflect cortical damage in early MS. Methods: We combined new proteomic method, TRIDENT, CSF analysis, and advanced 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in 64 MS patients at the time of diagnosis and 26 controls with other neurological disorders. MS patients were stratified according to cortical lesion (CL) load. Results: We identified 227 proteins differently expressed between the patients with high and low CL load. These were mainly related to complement and coagulation cascade as well as to iron homeostasis pathway (30 and 6% of all identified proteins, respectively). Accordingly, in the CSF of MS patients with high CL load at diagnosis, significantly higher levels of sCD163 (P < 0.0001), free hemoglobin (Hb) (P < 0.05), haptoglobin (P < 0.0001), and fibrinogen (P < 0.01) were detected. By contrast, CSF levels of sCD14 were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in MS patients with low CL load. Furthermore, CSF levels of sCD163 positively correlated (P < 0.01) with CSF levels of neurofilament, fibrinogen, and B cell-related molecules, such as CXCL13, CXCL12, IL10, and BAFF. Interpretation: Intrathecal dysregulation of iron homeostasis and coagulation pathway as well as B-cell and monocyte activity are strictly correlated with cortical damage at early disease stages.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Blood Coagulation Factors", "Brain", "Complement System Proteins", "Female", "Homeostasis", "Humans", "Iron", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting", "Proteomics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074793709", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"7801612382": {"Name": "Magliozzi R.", "AuthorID": "7801612382", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Brain Sciences, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "57197867420": {"Name": "Marastoni D.", "AuthorID": "57197867420", "AffiliationID": "60032256", "AffiliationName": "Neurology B, Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, University of Verona"}, "57217735667": {"Name": "Rossi S.", "AuthorID": "57217735667", "AffiliationID": "60010062", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology and Molecular Oncology, Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0"}, "55523754600": {"Name": "Castellaro M.", "AuthorID": "55523754600", "AffiliationID": "60032256", "AffiliationName": "Neurology B, Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, University of Verona"}, "57211659007": {"Name": "Poli A.", "AuthorID": "57211659007", "AffiliationID": "60032256", "AffiliationName": "Neurology B, Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, University of Verona"}, "57211659805": {"Name": "Lattanzi F.", "AuthorID": "57211659805", "AffiliationID": "60032256", "AffiliationName": "Neurology B, Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, University of Verona"}, "9736421900": {"Name": "Monaco S.", "AuthorID": "9736421900", "AffiliationID": "60032256", "AffiliationName": "Neurology B, Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, University of Verona"}, "14319094000": {"Name": "Calabrese M.", "AuthorID": "14319094000", "AffiliationID": "60032256", "AffiliationName": "Neurology B, Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, University of Verona"}, "15768161200": {"Name": "Nicholas R.", "AuthorID": "15768161200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Brain Sciences, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "7401829594": {"Name": "Reynolds R.", "AuthorID": "7401829594", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Brain Sciences, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "54784420800": {"Name": "Hametner S.", "AuthorID": "54784420800", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimmunology Department, Center for Brain Research, Medical University of Vienna"}, "35420677900": {"Name": "Lassmann H.", "AuthorID": "35420677900", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimmunology Department, Center for Brain Research, Medical University of Vienna"}, "6604018654": {"Name": "Facchiano F.", "AuthorID": "6604018654", "AffiliationID": "60010062", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology and Molecular Oncology, Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0"}, "35871244700": {"Name": "Visconti A.", "AuthorID": "35871244700", "AffiliationID": "109586941", "AffiliationName": "Medical Affairs Department, Merck Serono"}}}
