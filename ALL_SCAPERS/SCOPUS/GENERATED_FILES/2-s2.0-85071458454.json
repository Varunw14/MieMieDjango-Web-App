When this network is perturbed by transient exposure to ultraviolet light, short-term LCs are temporarily reconstituted from an initial wave of monocytes but thought to be superseded by more permanent repopulation with undefined LC precursors. However, the extent to which this process is relevant to immunopathological processes that damage LC population integrity is not known. Using a model of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, where alloreactive T cells directly target eLCs, we have asked whether and how the original LC network is ultimately restored. We find that donor monocytes, but not dendritic cells, are the precursors of long-term LCs in this context. Destruction of eLCs leads to recruitment of a wave of monocytes that engraft in the epidermis and undergo a sequential pathway of differentiation via transcriptionally distinct EpCAM+ precursors. Monocyte-derived LCs acquire the capacity of self-renewal, and proliferation in the epidermis matched that of steady-state eLCs. However, we identified a bottleneck in the differentiation and survival of epidermal monocytes, which, together with the slow rate of renewal of mature LCs, limits repair of the network. Furthermore, replenishment of the LC network leads to constitutive entry of cells into the epidermal compartment. Thus, immune injury triggers functional adaptation of mechanisms used to maintain tissue-resident macrophages at other sites, but this process is highly inefficient in the skin.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cells, Cultured", "Humans", "Langerhans Cells", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Mice, Transgenic", "Monocytes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071458454", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"57207920401": {"Name": "Ferrer I.R.", "AuthorID": "57207920401", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Institute Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer Studies, University College London"}, "57200193783": {"Name": "West H.C.", "AuthorID": "57200193783", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Institute Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer Studies, University College London"}, "56682617700": {"Name": "Sousa P.S.E.", "AuthorID": "56682617700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Institute Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer Studies, University College London"}, "6701831494": {"Name": "Chakraverty R.", "AuthorID": "6701831494", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Institute Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer Studies, University College London"}, "7401715179": {"Name": "Bennett C.L.", "AuthorID": "7401715179", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Institute Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer Studies, University College London"}, "35548946900": {"Name": "Henderson S.", "AuthorID": "35548946900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bill Lyons Informatics Centre, Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "16647815200": {"Name": "Ushakov D.S.", "AuthorID": "16647815200", "AffiliationID": "60177635, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Peter Gorer Department of Immunobiology, School of Immunology and Microbial Sciences, King's College London, New Hunt's House"}, "6602092133": {"Name": "Strid J.", "AuthorID": "6602092133", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Immunology and Inflammation, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Campus"}, "35742438800": {"Name": "Yates A.J.", "AuthorID": "35742438800", "AffiliationID": "60027565, 60002388", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center"}}}
