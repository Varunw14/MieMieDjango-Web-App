Design: A prospective observational cohort study of 177 women who had successful expectant management of tubal ectopic pregnancy, who attended a single Early Pregnancy Unit between January 2014 and December 2018. All participants were monitored until their serum beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (beta-HCG) dropped to non-pregnant concentrations and with 2-weekly follow-up ultrasound scans until resolution of the pregnancy. Results: A total of 112/177 (63.3%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 55.7\u201370.4) of tubal ectopic pregnancies were indiscernible on ultrasound 2 weeks after serum beta-HCG had returned to non-pregnant concentrations. In 8/177 (4.5%, 95% CI 2.0\u20138.7), physical resolution took longer than 78 days. There was a positive correlation between biochemical and physical resolution of tubal ectopic pregnancy (r = 0.21, P = 0.006). Conclusions: Physical resolution of tubal ectopic pregnancy is often prolonged and is positively correlated with initial and maximum beta-HCG concentrations. Results of this study indicate that beta-HCG resolution cannot be used as the end-point of expectant management of tubal ectopic pregnancy, which should be considered when counselling women and planning for future pregnancies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ectopic pregnancy", "Pregnancy complications", "Tubal Pregnancy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085905402", "SubjectAreas": [["Reproductive Medicine", "MEDI", "2743"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"]], "AuthorData": {"57210916516": {"Name": "Dooley W.", "AuthorID": "57210916516", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, Faculty of Population Health Sciences, University College London"}, "57220305757": {"Name": "De Braud L.", "AuthorID": "57220305757", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, Faculty of Population Health Sciences, University College London"}, "16507186800": {"Name": "Memtsa M.", "AuthorID": "16507186800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, Faculty of Population Health Sciences, University College London"}, "57191418451": {"Name": "Thanatsis N.", "AuthorID": "57191418451", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, Faculty of Population Health Sciences, University College London"}, "57203176734": {"Name": "Jauniaux E.", "AuthorID": "57203176734", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, Faculty of Population Health Sciences, University College London"}, "7004871743": {"Name": "Jurkovic D.", "AuthorID": "7004871743", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, Faculty of Population Health Sciences, University College London"}}}
