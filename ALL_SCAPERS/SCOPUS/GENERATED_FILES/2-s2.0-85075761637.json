Cities\u2019 transport infrastructure, particularly street networks, provides an invaluable source of information about the urban patterns generated by peoples\u2019 movements and their interactions. With the increasing availability of street network datasets and the advancements in deep learning methods, we are presented with an unprecedented opportunity to push the frontiers of urban modelling towards more data-driven and accurate models of urban forms.In this study, we present our initial work on applying deep generative models to urban street network data to create spatially explicit urban models. We based our work on Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) which are deep generative models that have recently gained their popularity due to the ability to generate realistic images. Initial results show that VAEs are capable of capturing key high-level urban network metrics using low-dimensional vectors and generating new urban forms of complexity matching the cities captured in the street network data.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Street networks", "Urban modelling", "Variational autoencoders"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075761637", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"]], "AuthorData": {"57200079515": {"Name": "Kempinska K.", "AuthorID": "57200079515", "AffiliationID": "60159677", "AffiliationName": "Alphamoon Ltd"}, "56013716500": {"Name": "Murcio R.", "AuthorID": "56013716500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA), University College London"}}}
