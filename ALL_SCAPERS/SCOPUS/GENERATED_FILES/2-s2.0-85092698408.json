Design: Single-center, comparative, retrospective interventional case series. Methods: POPULATION: Consecutive cases of keratoconus treated with big-bubble F-DALK from August 1, 2015, to September 1, 2018 and big-bubble M-DALK from September 1, 2012, to September 30, 2016. SETTING: Moorfields Eye Hospital, London. OBSERVATIONS: Data on preoperative status, operative details, intraoperative and postoperative complications, secondary interventions, and visual outcomes were archived on a customized spreadsheet for analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rate of intraoperative perforation and conversion to penetrating keratoplasty (PK) and the percentage of patients, post removal of sutures (ROS), with corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) \u226520/40. Results: We analyzed 58 eyes of 55 patients who underwent F-DALK and 326 eyes of 309 patients who underwent M-DALK. Intraoperative perforation of Descemet membrane occurred in 15 of 58 (25.9%) F-DALK cases compared to 148 of 326 (45.4%) M-DALK cases (P = .006). Intraoperative conversion to PK was carried out in 2 of 58 (3.4%) F-DALK cases compared to 80 of 326 (24.5%) M-DALK cases (P = .001). Post ROS, 86.5% of F-DALK eyes had a CDVA of \u226520/40 (15 \u00b1 7.3 months after surgery) compared to 83.7% of M-DALK eyes (24.9 \u00b1 10.6 months) (P =. 825). Conclusion: Laser automation of some steps in DALK for keratoconus may reduce the rate of intraoperative Descemet perforation and the conversion to PK in a multi-surgeon setting.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cornea", "Corneal Topography", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Keratoconus", "Keratoplasty, Penetrating", "Laser Therapy", "Male", "Retrospective Studies", "Surgeons", "Treatment Outcome", "Visual Acuity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092698408", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"57202339413": {"Name": "Gadhvi K.A.", "AuthorID": "57202339413", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Corneal and External Eye Diseases, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "25960336600": {"Name": "Romano V.", "AuthorID": "25960336600", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Corneal and External Eye Diseases, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "55340829200": {"Name": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Vega Cueto L.", "AuthorID": "55340829200", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Corneal and External Eye Diseases, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "57094732600": {"Name": "Aiello F.", "AuthorID": "57094732600", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Corneal and External Eye Diseases, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "36028093000": {"Name": "Day A.C.", "AuthorID": "36028093000", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Corneal and External Eye Diseases, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7102413535": {"Name": "Gore D.M.", "AuthorID": "7102413535", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Corneal and External Eye Diseases, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7102506160": {"Name": "Allan B.D.", "AuthorID": "7102506160", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Corneal and External Eye Diseases, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}}}
