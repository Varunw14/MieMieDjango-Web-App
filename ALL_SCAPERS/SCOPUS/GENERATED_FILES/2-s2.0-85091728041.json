Herein, a novel ternary alloy catalyst supported on carbon, PdIrAu/C, has been synthesised, characterised and compared to the binary PdIr/C to show how the addition of Au improves the stability of the catalyst. Transmission electron microscopy was utilised to analyse electrode structure as a function of the synthesis method, showing the optimum annealing temperature, of those tested, to be 400 \u00b0C, while inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry provided analysis of the degradation of the two catalysts, confirming the PdIrAu/C catalyst is more stable at potentials similar to those at a fuel cell anode than PdIr/C.", "AuthorKeywords": ["alloy", "durability", "electrocatalysts", "fuel cells", "gold", "iridium", "palladium"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091728041", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Electrochemistry", "CHEM", "1603"]], "AuthorData": {"57201655565": {"Name": "Allerston L.K.", "AuthorID": "57201655565", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Research, School of Chemical Engineering, University of Birmingham"}, "7005875522": {"Name": "Rees N.V.", "AuthorID": "7005875522", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Research, School of Chemical Engineering, University of Birmingham"}, "57210462729": {"Name": "Hodgson D.", "AuthorID": "57210462729", "AffiliationID": "122577104", "AffiliationName": "Amalyst Limited"}, "56110284600": {"Name": "Gibbs C.", "AuthorID": "56110284600", "AffiliationID": "122577104", "AffiliationName": "Amalyst Limited"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.J.L.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Laboratory, Department of Chemical Engineering, UCL"}}}
