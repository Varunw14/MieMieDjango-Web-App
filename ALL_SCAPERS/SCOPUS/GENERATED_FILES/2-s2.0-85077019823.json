OCTA is a novel technique, which demonstrates capillary networks based on the amount of light returned from moving blood cells, providing further information on pathophysiological changes in uveitis. The aim of this review is to describe the basic principles of OCTA and its application to ocular inflammatory disorders. It particularly emphasizes on its contribution not only in the diagnosis and management of the disease but also in the identification of possible complications, comparing it with fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA). Although the advent of OCTA has remarkably enhanced the assessment of uveitic entities, we highlight the need for further investigation in order to better understand its application to these conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blood flow", "Chorioretinal inflammation", "Dye-based angiography", "Optical coherence tomography angiography", "Uveitis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077019823", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"6701842055": {"Name": "Tranos P.", "AuthorID": "6701842055", "AffiliationID": "115099593", "AffiliationName": "Vitreoretinal & Uveitis Department, Ophthalmica Clinic"}, "57205326692": {"Name": "Karasavvidou E.M.", "AuthorID": "57205326692", "AffiliationID": "60003720", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Hippokrateio General Hospital of Thessaloniki"}, "57212553513": {"Name": "Gkorou O.", "AuthorID": "57212553513", "AffiliationID": "115099593", "AffiliationName": "Vitreoretinal & Uveitis Department, Ophthalmica Clinic"}, "7003495942": {"Name": "Pavesio C.", "AuthorID": "7003495942", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Uveitis Department, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}}}
