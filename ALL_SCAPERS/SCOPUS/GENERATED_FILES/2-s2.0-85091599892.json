Cultural transmission and evolution theory frequently emphasizes apprentices\u2019 need for accurate imitation (high-fidelity copying) of their mentors\u2019 actions. However, the ensuing prediction of standardized fashioning patterns within communities of practice has not been directly addressed in handicraft traditions such as pottery throwing. To fill this gap, we analysed variation in vessel morphogenesis amongst and within traditional potters from culturally different workshops producing for the same market. We demonstrate that, for each vessel type studied, individual potters reliably followed distinctive routes through morphological space towards a much-less-variable common final shape. Our results indicate that mastering the pottery handicraft does not result from accurately reproducing a particular model behaviour specific to the community\u2019s cultural tradition. We provide evidence that, at the level of the elementary clay-deforming gestures, individual learning rather than simple imitation is required for the acquisition of a complex motor skill such as throwing pottery.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Consensus Development Conferences as Topic", "Culture", "Humans", "Motor Skills", "Social Learning"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091599892", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"36182438900": {"Name": "Gandon E.", "AuthorID": "36182438900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "35173363300": {"Name": "Nonaka T.", "AuthorID": "35173363300", "AffiliationID": "60011418", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Human Development and Environment, Kobe University"}, "7004085093": {"Name": "Endler J.A.", "AuthorID": "7004085093", "AffiliationID": "60089707, 60018805", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Integrative Ecology, School of Life & Environmental Sciences, Deakin University"}, "23391813700": {"Name": "Coyle T.", "AuthorID": "23391813700", "AffiliationID": "60102127, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "Institut des Sciences du Mouvement, Aix Marseille Universit\u00e9, CNRS"}, "7004257641": {"Name": "Bootsma R.J.", "AuthorID": "7004257641", "AffiliationID": "60102127, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "Institut des Sciences du Mouvement, Aix Marseille Universit\u00e9, CNRS"}}}
