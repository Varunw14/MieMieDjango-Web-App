Haemophilia published by John Wiley & Sons LtdIntroduction: Previous studies reported the efficacy and safety profile of extended half-life PEGylated recombinant factor VIII (FVIII) rurioctocog alfa pegol (TAK-660, SHP660, BAX 855) in preventing bleeding in haemophilia A patients. Aim: This study evaluated long-term safety and efficacy of rurioctocog alfa pegol for prophylaxis and treatment of bleeding in previously treated children and adults. Methods: In this phase 3b, prospective, open-label, multicentre study (NCT01945593), eligible patients \u2264 75 years with severe haemophilia A (FVIII < 1%) received prophylactic rurioctocog alfa pegol in a fixed dose (FD, twice-weekly or less frequent) or pharmacokinetic (PK)-tailored dose regimen. Co-primary endpoints were incidence of confirmed FVIII inhibitory antibody development and spontaneous annualized bleed rate (ABR), analysed using a generalised linear model. Secondary endpoints included overall haemostatic efficacy, occurrence of adverse events and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Results: Overall, 216 patients were included; mean (SD) age at enrolment was 22.8 (15.7) years. No patients developed confirmed FVIII inhibitors. The point estimate (95% CI) of mean spontaneous ABR was 1.20 (0.92-1.56) among 186 patients receiving twice-weekly FD prophylaxis and 0.96 (0.54-1.71) among 25 patients receiving PK-tailored prophylaxis. Overall haemostatic efficacy was rated good or excellent in 88.6% of all bleeds. No new safety signals were observed. Patients reported improvements in HRQoL measures of pain, and physical and mental well-being. Conclusion: These results highlight the long-term safety and efficacy of rurioctocog alfa pegol prophylaxis in previously treated children and adults with severe haemophilia A, with a safety profile similar to previous studies and continuing ABR reduction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adverse effects", "haemophilia A", "long-term outcomes", "patient-reported outcome measures", "prophylaxis", "recombinant factor VIII", "rurioctocog alfa pegol"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087165795", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"57193134405": {"Name": "Chowdary P.", "AuthorID": "57193134405", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Katharine Dormandy Haemophilia and Thrombosis Centre, Royal Free Hospital"}, "26029183300": {"Name": "Mullins E.S.", "AuthorID": "26029183300", "AffiliationID": "60017412, 60030440", "AffiliationName": "Division of Hematology, Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center and Department of Paediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine"}, "7004710808": {"Name": "Konkle B.A.", "AuthorID": "7004710808", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Bloodworks Northwest and University of Washington"}, "53981774300": {"Name": "McGuinn C.", "AuthorID": "53981774300", "AffiliationID": "60007997", "AffiliationName": "Weill Cornell Medical College"}, "55494467600": {"Name": "Park Y.S.", "AuthorID": "55494467600", "AffiliationID": "60025071", "AffiliationName": "Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong"}, "55786651500": {"Name": "Stasyshyn O.", "AuthorID": "55786651500", "AffiliationID": "60068515", "AffiliationName": "Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine"}, "6603145513": {"Name": "Zulfikar B.", "AuthorID": "6603145513", "AffiliationID": "60117280", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Hematology, Istanbul University Cerrahpasa"}, "13102650700": {"Name": "Engl W.", "AuthorID": "13102650700", "AffiliationID": "115776717", "AffiliationName": "Baxalta Innovations GmbH, a Member of the Takeda Group of Companies"}, "6506136597": {"Name": "Tangada S.", "AuthorID": "6506136597", "AffiliationID": "115787842", "AffiliationName": "Baxalta US Inc., a Member of the Takeda Group of Companies"}}}
