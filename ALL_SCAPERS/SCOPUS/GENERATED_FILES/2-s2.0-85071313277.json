Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdAim: To evaluate the superiority of coronally advanced flaps (CAFs) when used in combination with a xenogeneic collagen matrix (CMX) for root coverage of multiple adjacent gingival recessions. Materials and Methods: Participants with at least 2 upper adjacent teeth exhibiting gingival recession depth \u22652 mm were recruited and randomized to CAF with (test) or without (control) CMX, respectively. Mean and complete root coverage, amount of keratinized tissue (KTw), gingival thickness (GThick) and patient-reported outcomes (PROMs) were recorded at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. Results: Twenty-four patients providing 61 gingival recessions were analysed. After 1 year, gingival recession depth decreased from 2.3 \u00b1 0.7 to 0.3 \u00b1 0.4 mm in the CAF + CMX group (2.0 \u00b1 0.8 mm meanRC) and from 2.6 \u00b1 1.0 to 0.6 \u00b1 0.3 mm in the control group (2.0 \u00b1 1.1 mm meanRC). No difference was observed between the two groups (p = 0.2023). Nineteen (63%) of the test and 16 (52%) of control defects showed complete root coverage (p = 0.4919). GThick greatly increased in the test group (0.5 mm; 0.2\u20130.8 mm, 95% CI; p = 0.0057). No difference between the two groups was observed for KTw (p = 0.5668) and PROMs. Conclusion: At 1 year, CAF + CMX provided similar root coverage to CAF alone, but a significant increase in gingival thickness.", "AuthorKeywords": ["gingiva", "gingival recession", "humans", "Mucograft", "randomized controlled trials", "smiling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Collagen", "Connective Tissue", "Gingiva", "Gingival Recession", "Humans", "Surgical Flaps", "Tooth Root", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071313277", "SubjectAreas": [["Periodontics", "DENT", "3506"]], "AuthorData": {"7003711963": {"Name": "Rotundo R.", "AuthorID": "7003711963", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Honorary in Periodontology, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "57210729105": {"Name": "Genzano L.", "AuthorID": "57210729105", "AffiliationID": "101759597", "AffiliationName": "Private Practice"}, "57210724334": {"Name": "Patel D.", "AuthorID": "57210724334", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Specialist Trainee, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "6507515725": {"Name": "D'Aiuto F.", "AuthorID": "6507515725", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Chair and Honorary Consultant in Periodontology, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "6602845073": {"Name": "Nieri M.", "AuthorID": "6602845073", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Translational Medicine, University of Florence"}}}
