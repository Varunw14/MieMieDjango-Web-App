We present the largest analysis of anaesthetic logbooks to date, with data from 494,235 cases logged by 964 anaesthetists over a 4-year period. Our analysis describes and compares the annual case-load and supervision levels of different grades of anaesthetists across the UK and Republic of Ireland. We calculated the number of cases undertaken per year by grade (median (IQR [range]) core trainees = 388 (252\u2013512 [52\u20131204]); specialist trainees = 344 (228\u2013480 [52\u20131144]); and consultants = 328 (204\u2013500 [52\u20131316]). Overall, the proportion of cases undertaken with direct consultant supervision was 56.7% and 41.6% for core trainees and specialist trainees, respectively. The proportion of supervised cases reduced out-of-hours, for both core trainees (day 93.5%, evening 86.3%, night 78.6%) and specialist trainees (day 81.0%, evening 67.7%, night 56.4%).", "AuthorKeywords": ["continuing professional development", "medical education", "supervision", "training"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anesthesiologists", "Anesthesiology", "Clinical Competence", "Databases, Factual", "Humans", "Ireland", "Retrospective Studies", "United Kingdom", "Workload"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073940507", "SubjectAreas": [["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"57204672212": {"Name": "Perella P.", "AuthorID": "57204672212", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "57201497364": {"Name": "Palmer E.", "AuthorID": "57201497364", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "57213930782": {"Name": "Conway R.", "AuthorID": "57213930782", "AffiliationID": "123355955", "AffiliationName": "Medberry Ltd"}, "57211436042": {"Name": "Wong D.J.N.", "AuthorID": "57211436042", "AffiliationID": "60116802", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Academic Anaesthesia Health Services Research Centre, Royal College of Anaesthetists"}}}
