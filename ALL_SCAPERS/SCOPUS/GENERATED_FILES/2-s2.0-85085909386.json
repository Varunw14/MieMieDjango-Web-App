The authors have previously demonstrated that the variance of spectral entropy (VSE) is a reliable estimate of SNR in nonstationary noise. Based on pre-estimated VSE-SNR relationship functions, the SNR of unseen acoustic environments can be estimated from the measured VSE. This study predicts that introducing a compressive function based on cochlear processing will increase the stability of the pre-estimated VSE-SNR relationship functions. This study demonstrates that calculating the VSE based on a nonlinear filter-bank, simulating cochlear compression, reduces the VSE-based SNR estimation errors. VSE-SNR relationship functions were estimated using speech tokens presented in babble noise comprised of different numbers of speakers. Results showed that the coefficient of determination (R2) of the estimated VSE-SNR relationship functions have absolute percentage improvements of over 26% when using a filter-bank with a compressive function, compared to when using a linear filter-bank without compression. In 2-talker babble noise, the estimation accuracy is more than 3 dB better than other published methods.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085909386", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"]], "AuthorData": {"57190842380": {"Name": "Liu F.", "AuthorID": "57190842380", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "6603720155": {"Name": "Demosthenous A.", "AuthorID": "6603720155", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57203606003": {"Name": "Yasin I.", "AuthorID": "57203606003", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
