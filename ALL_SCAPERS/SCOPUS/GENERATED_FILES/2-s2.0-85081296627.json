The solution is based on identifying a minimal and finite Lie algebra that generates the time-evolution of the system. This reduces the problem to considering a finite set of coupled ordinary differential equations of real functions. To demonstrate the applicability of our method, we compute the degree of non-Gaussianity of the time-evolved state of the system by means of a measure based on the relative entropy of the non-Gaussian state and its closest Gaussian reference state. We find that the addition of a constant mechanical squeezing term to the standard optomechanical Hamiltonian generally decreases the overall non-Gaussian character of the state. For sinusoidally modulated squeezing, the two second-order differential equations mentioned above take the form of the Mathieu equation. We derive perturbative solutions for a small squeezing amplitude at parametric resonance and show that they correspond to the rotating-wave approximation at times larger than the scale set by the mechanical frequency. We find that the non-Gaussianity of the state increases with both time and the squeezing parameter in this specific regime.", "AuthorKeywords": ["non-Gaussianity", "nonlinear optomechanics", "optomechanics", "quantum optomechanics", "squeezing"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081296627", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Mathematical Physics", "MATH", "2610"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57203859921": {"Name": "Qvarfort S.", "AuthorID": "57203859921", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7006026939": {"Name": "Serafini A.", "AuthorID": "7006026939", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "26538352900": {"Name": "Xuereb A.", "AuthorID": "26538352900", "AffiliationID": "60072651", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Malta"}, "7201926643": {"Name": "Braun D.", "AuthorID": "7201926643", "AffiliationID": "60017246", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Theoretische Physik, Eberhard-Karls-Universitat T\u00fcbingen"}, "37005823500": {"Name": "Ratzel D.", "AuthorID": "37005823500", "AffiliationID": "60000762", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Physik, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin"}, "36833573200": {"Name": "Bruschi D.E.", "AuthorID": "36833573200", "AffiliationID": "60033241", "AffiliationName": "Theoretical Physics, Universitat des Saarlandes"}}}
