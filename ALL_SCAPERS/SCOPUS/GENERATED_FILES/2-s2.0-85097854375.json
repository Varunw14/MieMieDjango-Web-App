However, there are challenges associated with such trials, which researchers must address. This discussion paper follows the structure of the Down Your Drink trial methodology paper, providing an update from the literature for each key trial parameter (recruitment, registration eligibility checks, consent and participant withdrawal, randomization, engagement with a web-based intervention, retention, data quality and analysis, spamming, cybersquatting, patient and public involvement, and risk management and adverse events), along with our own recommendations based on designing the Relatives Education and Coping Toolkit randomized controlled trial for relatives of people with psychosis or bipolar disorder. The key recommendations outlined here are relevant for future web-based and hybrid trials and studies using iterative development and test models such as the Accelerated Creation-to-Sustainment model, both within general health research and specifically within mental health research for relatives. Researchers should continue to share lessons learned from conducting web-based trials of web-based interventions to benefit future studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carers", "Internet", "Mental health", "Methods", "Randomized controlled trial", "Relatives", "Research design", "Web"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85097854375", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57210018732": {"Name": "Robinson H.", "AuthorID": "57210018732", "AffiliationID": "60117764, 60117923, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "Division of Health Research, Spectrum Centre for Mental Health Research, Lancaster University"}, "57195051944": {"Name": "Flowers S.", "AuthorID": "57195051944", "AffiliationID": "60117764, 60117923, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "Division of Health Research, Spectrum Centre for Mental Health Research, Lancaster University"}, "55330903800": {"Name": "Jones S.H.", "AuthorID": "55330903800", "AffiliationID": "60117764, 60117923, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "Division of Health Research, Spectrum Centre for Mental Health Research, Lancaster University"}, "57195053359": {"Name": "Mezes B.", "AuthorID": "57195053359", "AffiliationID": "60117764, 60117923, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "Division of Health Research, Spectrum Centre for Mental Health Research, Lancaster University"}, "7403910759": {"Name": "Walker A.", "AuthorID": "7403910759", "AffiliationID": "60117764, 60117923, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "Division of Health Research, Spectrum Centre for Mental Health Research, Lancaster University"}, "6506642330": {"Name": "Lobban F.", "AuthorID": "6506642330", "AffiliationID": "60117764, 60117923, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "Division of Health Research, Spectrum Centre for Mental Health Research, Lancaster University"}, "56685037400": {"Name": "Appelbe D.", "AuthorID": "56685037400", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics, Clinical Trials Research Centre, University of Liverpool"}, "35500901600": {"Name": "Dodd S.", "AuthorID": "35500901600", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics, Clinical Trials Research Centre, University of Liverpool"}, "57207946452": {"Name": "Rainford N.", "AuthorID": "57207946452", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics, Clinical Trials Research Centre, University of Liverpool"}, "57191166941": {"Name": "Rosala-Hallas A.", "AuthorID": "57191166941", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics, Clinical Trials Research Centre, University of Liverpool"}, "57212501855": {"Name": "Williamson P.", "AuthorID": "57212501855", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics, Clinical Trials Research Centre, University of Liverpool"}, "7406331085": {"Name": "Johnson S.", "AuthorID": "7406331085", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "36981803100": {"Name": "Mateus C.", "AuthorID": "36981803100", "AffiliationID": "60117764, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "Division of Health Research, Lancaster University"}, "7202670002": {"Name": "Murray E.", "AuthorID": "7202670002", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}}}
