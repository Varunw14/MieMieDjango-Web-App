All rights reserved.This article, derived from a larger EU-funded empirical research project, draws on a comparative analysis of pioneering global citizenship education (GCE) in-service primary teacher education programmes, as theorized and practised in four European countries, to explore how higher education institutions (HEIs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and participating teachers shape the development of content-based, competence-based and values-based approaches to teacher education. With reference to the multiple-site case study in Ireland, Austria, the Czech Republic and Italy, this article argues that, through investment, structural and institutional support and professional teacher education expertise, HEIs are, alongside NGOs and in-service teachers, pivotal actors in the collaborative development of GCE teacher education. The article concludes that successful collaborations can foster teacher agency through transformative, values-based approaches to GCE teacher education.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Comparative education", "Global citizenship education", "Multi-stakeholder collaboration", "Teacher agency", "Teacher education"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073273193", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"55569994300": {"Name": "Tarozzi M.", "AuthorID": "55569994300", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "57191061287": {"Name": "Mallon B.", "AuthorID": "57191061287", "AffiliationID": "60025059", "AffiliationName": "Dublin City University"}}}
