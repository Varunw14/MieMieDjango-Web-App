However, traditional energy models and scenarios generally assume exogenous policy targets and fail to capture this co-evolution between policy-makers and heterogeneous private and public investors. This paper uses BRAIN-Energy, a novel agent-based model of investment in electricity generation to simulate and contrast government and investor dynamics in the transition pathways of the UK, German and Italian electricity sectors. Key findings show that a successful transition \u2013 which achieves the energy policy \u201ctrilemma\u201d (low carbon, secure, affordable) \u2013 requires the co-evolution of the policy dimension (strong and frequently updatable CO2 price, renewable subsidies and capacity market) with the strategies of the heterogeneous market players. If this dynamic balance is maintained then incentives are politically feasible and suppliers learn and evolve (in what we term a virtuous cycle). If either the incentives are too weak to drive learning or too expensive so the policy regime collapses, then the transition fails on one of its key dimensions (in what we term a vicious cycle). Getting this balance right is harder in risky markets that also have players with more pronounced bounded rationality and path dependence in how they make investments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Agent-based modelling", "Co-evolution", "Electricity", "Governance", "Heterogeneity of actors", "Investment decisions"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079243214", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Nuclear Energy and Engineering", "ENER", "2104"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"]], "AuthorData": {"57214080337": {"Name": "Barazza E.", "AuthorID": "57214080337", "AffiliationID": "60084282", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute"}, "57204344067": {"Name": "Strachan N.", "AuthorID": "57204344067", "AffiliationID": "60084282", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute"}}}
