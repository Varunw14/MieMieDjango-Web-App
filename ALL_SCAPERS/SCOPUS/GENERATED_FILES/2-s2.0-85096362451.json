Reduced uterine blood flow (UBF) and lack of bioavailable VEGF due to placental insufficiency is a major cause. Transduction of uterine arteries in normal or FGR sheep and guinea pigs using an adenovirus (Ad) encoding VEGF isoforms A (Ad.VEGF-A165) and a FLAG-tagged pre-processed short form D (DDNDC, Ad.VEGF-DDNDC-FLAG) increases endothelial nitric oxide expression, enhances relaxation and reduces constriction of the uterine arteries and their branches. UBF and angiogenesis are increased long term, improving fetal growth in utero. For clinical trial development we compared Ad.VEGF vector transduction efficiency and function in endothelial cells (ECs) derived from different species. We aimed to compare the transduction efficiency and function of the pre-clinical study Ad. constructs (Ad.VEGF-A165, Ad.VEGF-DDNDC-FLAG) with the intended clinical trial construct (Ad.VEGF-DDNDC) where the FLAG tag is removed. We infected ECs from human umbilical vein, pregnant sheep uterine artery, pregnant guinea pig aorta and non-pregnant rabbit aorta, with increasing multiplicity of infection (MOI) for 24 or 48 hours of three Ad.VEGF vectors, compared to control Ad. containing the LacZ gene (Ad.LacZ). VEGF supernatant expression was analysed by ELISA. Functional assessment used tube formation assay and Erk-Akt phosphorylation by ELISA. VEGF expression was higher after Ad.VEGF-DDNDC-FLAG and Ad.VEGF-DDNDC transduction compared to Ad.VEGF-A165 in all EC types (*p < 0.001). Tube formation was higher in ECs transduced with Ad.VEGF-DDNDC in all species compared to other constructs (***p < 0.001, *p < 0.05 with rabbit aortic ECs). Phospho-Erk and phospho-Akt assays displayed no differences between the three vector constructs, whose effect was, as in other experiments, higher than Ad.LacZ (***p < 0.001). In conclusion, we observed high transduction efficiency and functional effects of Ad.VEGF-DDNDC vector with comparability in major pathway activation to constructs used in pre-clinical studies, supporting its use in a clinical trial.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adenovirus", "Endothelial cells", "Gene transfer", "VEGF"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096362451", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"57192640201": {"Name": "Rossi C.", "AuthorID": "57192640201", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Biology and Medicine, University College London"}, "57201620424": {"Name": "Lees M.", "AuthorID": "57201620424", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Biology and Medicine, University College London"}, "56179129000": {"Name": "Spencer R.", "AuthorID": "56179129000", "AffiliationID": "125398120", "AffiliationName": "Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Institute for Women's Health"}, "7006889522": {"Name": "Peebles D.M.", "AuthorID": "7006889522", "AffiliationID": "125398120", "AffiliationName": "Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Institute for Women's Health"}, "7402605276": {"Name": "David A.L.", "AuthorID": "7402605276", "AffiliationID": "125398120", "AffiliationName": "Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Institute for Women's Health"}, "35604074600": {"Name": "Mehta V.", "AuthorID": "35604074600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Biology and Medicine, University College London"}, "55619306923": {"Name": "Martin J.", "AuthorID": "55619306923", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Biology and Medicine, University College London"}, "7006463251": {"Name": "Zachary I.", "AuthorID": "7006463251", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Biology and Medicine, University College London"}, "7801651333": {"Name": "Heikura T.", "AuthorID": "7801651333", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "A.I.Virtanen Institute for Molecular Sciences, University of Eastern Finland"}, "57219248024": {"Name": "Yla-Herttuala S.", "AuthorID": "57219248024", "AffiliationID": "117223437", "AffiliationName": "European Society of Cell and Gene Therapy Conference"}, "57199183057": {"Name": "Shaw R.", "AuthorID": "57199183057", "AffiliationID": "122578166", "AffiliationName": "FinVector Oy"}, "56798436300": {"Name": "Karhinen M.", "AuthorID": "56798436300", "AffiliationID": "122578166", "AffiliationName": "FinVector Oy"}}}
