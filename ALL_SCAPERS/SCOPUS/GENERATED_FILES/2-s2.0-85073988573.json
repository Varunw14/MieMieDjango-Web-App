KGaA, WeinheimIncorporating growth into contemporary material functionality presents a grand challenge in materials design. The F-actin cytoskeleton is an active polymer network that serves as the mechanical scaffolding for eukaryotic cells, growing and remodeling in order to determine changes in cell shape. Nucleated from the membrane, filaments polymerize and grow into a dense network whose dynamics of assembly and disassembly, or \u201cturnover,\u201d coordinates both fluidity and rigidity. Here, the extent of F-actin nucleation is varied from a membrane surface in a biomimetic model of the cytoskeleton constructed from purified protein. It is found that nucleation of F-actin mediates the accumulation and dissipation of polymerization-induced F-actin bending energy. At high and low nucleation, bending energies are low and easily relaxed yielding an isotropic material. However, at an intermediate critical nucleation, stresses are not relaxed by turnover and the internal energy accumulates 100-fold. In this case, high filament curvatures template further assembly of F-actin, driving the formation and stabilization of vortex-like topological defects. Thus, nucleation coordinates mechanical and chemical timescales to encode shape memory into active materials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["actin", "defects", "memory", "nucleation", "turnover"], "IndexKeywords": ["actin", "Contemporary materials", "Critical nucleation", "Internal energies", "Isotropic materials", "Mechanical memory", "Topological defect", "turnover"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073988573", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57210470397": {"Name": "Yadav V.", "AuthorID": "57210470397", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Yale University"}, "57204159104": {"Name": "Tabatabai A.P.", "AuthorID": "57204159104", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Yale University"}, "8100955900": {"Name": "Murrell M.P.", "AuthorID": "8100955900", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Yale University"}, "57218134516": {"Name": "Banerjee D.S.", "AuthorID": "57218134516", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "53363223100": {"Name": "Banerjee S.", "AuthorID": "53363223100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7003684420": {"Name": "Kovar D.R.", "AuthorID": "7003684420", "AffiliationID": "60029278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology, The University of Chicago"}, "55696501300": {"Name": "Kim T.", "AuthorID": "55696501300", "AffiliationID": "60015912, 60009254", "AffiliationName": "MJIS 3031, Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering, Purdue University"}}}
