Geweke's autoregressive formulation of Granger causality is used to compute linear transfer entropy, and Schreiber's general, non-parametric, information-theoretic formulation is used to quantify nonlinear transfer entropy. We first validate these measures against synthetic data. Then we apply these measures to detect statistical causality between social sentiment changes and cryptocurrency returns. We validate results by performing permutation tests by shuffling the time series, and calculate the Z-score. We also investigate different approaches for partitioning in non-parametric density estimation which can improve the significance. Using these techniques on sentiment and price data over a 48-month period to August 2018, for four major cryptocurrencies, namely bitcoin (BTC), ripple (XRP), litecoin (LTC) and ethereum (ETH), we detect significant information transfer, on hourly timescales, with greater net information transfer from sentiment to price for XRP and LTC, and instead from price to sentiment for BTC and ETH. We report the scale of nonlinear statistical causality to be an order of magnitude larger than the linear case.", "AuthorKeywords": ["causality", "cryptocurrency", "Granger", "information theory", "transfer entropy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85093498853", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57219514827": {"Name": "Keskin Z.", "AuthorID": "57219514827", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7003460450": {"Name": "Aste T.", "AuthorID": "7003460450", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies, University College London"}}}
