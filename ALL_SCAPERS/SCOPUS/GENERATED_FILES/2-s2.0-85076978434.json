All Rights Reserved.Europe is a diverse and heterogeneous linguistic community that faces the challenge of educating an increasingly multicultural and multilingual population. Language teachers are key players on this regard as they may foster multilingualism and contribute to students\u2019 inclusion in their classrooms. Portugal is no exception and Portuguese schools and teachers are adapting to an increasingly multilingual society, a situation that is not entirely new but nevertheless presents new challenges. In the present article, we analyse teachers\u2019 conceptions regarding multilingualism in Portugal and the educational practices developed in multilingual classrooms. Participants were 505 teachers from all levels of education teaching in multilingual classrooms. A questionnaire created by the multilingual group of the European Literacy Network translated and adapted for Portugal was answered online. The results show a low concentration of immigrant children per class, the prominent role of English as a second language, teachers with an open attitude towards linguistic diversity, who are multilingual and aware of ultilingualism, and value the language and culture of their students. They believe that being able to master different languages is an asset to the students' academic and cognitive development.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Educational practices", "Immigrants", "L1", "L2", "Multilingualism", "Teachers\u2019 conceptions"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076978434", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"56124794700": {"Name": "Martins M.A.", "AuthorID": "56124794700", "AffiliationID": "60029444", "AffiliationName": "Margarida Alves Martins, Centro de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o em Educa\u00e7\u00e3o, ISPA \u2013 Instituto Universit\u00e1rio"}, "56432594300": {"Name": "Sousa O.", "AuthorID": "56432594300", "AffiliationID": "60106051, 60018688", "AffiliationName": "Escola Superior de Educa\u00e7\u00e3o de Lisboa \u2013 ESELx, Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico de Lisboa Lisboa, Portugal/Instituto de Educa\u00e7\u00e3o, Universidade de Lisboa"}, "7101787229": {"Name": "Castro S.L.", "AuthorID": "7101787229", "AffiliationID": "60007249", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Psicologia, Faculdade de Psicologia e Ci\u00eancias da Educa\u00e7\u00e3o, Universidade do Porto"}, "7004429681": {"Name": "Dockrell J.", "AuthorID": "7004429681", "AffiliationID": "60117700", "AffiliationName": "Psychology & Human Development UCL \u2013 Institute of Education"}, "7006823109": {"Name": "Papadopoulos T.", "AuthorID": "7006823109", "AffiliationID": "60071343", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology Centre for Applied Neuroscience, University of Cyprus, Nicosia"}, "55962118500": {"Name": "Mifsud C.", "AuthorID": "55962118500", "AffiliationID": "60072651", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Literacy, University of Malta, Msida"}}}
