The article explores the colonial origins of Singapore\u2019s contemporary ethnic population breakdown and the emergence of ethnic Chinese as the island\u2019s majority community. It examines how the Singapore government has come to officially depict the island\u2019s multicultural \u2018success story\u2019 since independence, and the official emphasis on the necessity of maintaining fixed ethnic ratios which ensure that Chinese remain roughly three-quarters of the island\u2019s settled population. At the same time, this article interrogates the official rationale behind such a policy, illuminating the colonial-era discursive assumptions that underpin it, and highlighting the way such assumptions have been contested. The article especially focuses on the role that immigration has played in the state\u2019s effort to ensure Singapore\u2019s racial \u2018balance\u2019, and argues that such an ethnically-determined immigration policy has frequently unsettled the Chinese majority it has been intended to bolster, while calling into question the multicultural idealism on which the Republic of Singapore was ostensibly founded.", "AuthorKeywords": ["colonial discourse", "demography", "ethnic relations", "immigration", "multiculturalism", "population", "Singapore"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088373118", "SubjectAreas": [["Demography", "SOCI", "3317"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"]], "AuthorData": {"35887072000": {"Name": "Frost M.R.", "AuthorID": "35887072000", "AffiliationID": "60001359", "AffiliationName": "Department of History, University of Essex"}}}
