I show that three of the key drivers for fictionalising research accounts relate to the ambitions of aesthetic engagement, verisimilitude and user engagement. I look at the different ways that authors have attempted to achieve these ambitions and the methodological tensions that arise from them. I show that contemporary evaluative criteria in qualitative inquiry helps us to understand that fictional reporting is an important tool for researchers in creating more affective writing. However, there are divergences in how researchers conceive of and use fictional accounts, which highlight the importance of continued debate about the methodological practices of its use. In order to contribute to these debates I point to three areas that need particular consideration for researchers working in this area: (1) the structures of academic publishing and their embodiment in university audit regimes; (2) the absence of engagement with alternative forms of writing in academic professional development and training; and (3) the substantial ethical dilemmas in the use of fictional accounts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["affect", "ethics", "Fiction", "qualitative evaluative criteria", "research impact", "user engagement", "verisimilitude"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086092452", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"], ["History and Philosophy of Science", "ARTS", "1207"]], "AuthorData": {"55588397700": {"Name": "Gibson W.", "AuthorID": "55588397700", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Education"}}}
