The past decade has offered new insights into trigeminal neuralgia symptomatology, pathophysiology, and treatment, leading to a change in the classification of the condition. An accurate diagnosis is crucial because neuroimaging interpretation and clinical management differ among the various forms of facial pain. MRI using specific sequences should be a part of the diagnostic workup to detect a possible neurovascular contact and exclude secondary causes. Demonstration of a neurovascular contact should not be used to confirm a diagnosis but rather to facilitate surgical decision making. Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine are drugs of first choice for long-term treatment, whereas microvascular decompression is the first-line surgery in medically refractory patients. Advances in neuroimaging techniques and animal models will provide further insight into the causes of trigeminal neuralgia and its pathophysiology. Development of more efficacious treatment options is highly warranted.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Anticonvulsants", "Carbamazepine", "Decompression, Surgical", "Disease Management", "Humans", "Neuroimaging", "Oxcarbazepine", "Pain Measurement", "Trigeminal Neuralgia"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089515336", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"8861682800": {"Name": "Bendtsen L.", "AuthorID": "8861682800", "AffiliationID": "60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Danish Headache Center"}, "56743299000": {"Name": "Heinskou T.B.", "AuthorID": "56743299000", "AffiliationID": "60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Danish Headache Center"}, "6504586620": {"Name": "Maarbjerg S.", "AuthorID": "6504586620", "AffiliationID": "60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Danish Headache Center"}, "56810833400": {"Name": "Zakrzewska J.M.", "AuthorID": "56810833400", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Eastman Dental Hospital, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6506463954": {"Name": "Hodaie M.", "AuthorID": "6506463954", "AffiliationID": "60002401", "AffiliationName": "Krembil Brain Institute, Toronto Western Hospital"}, "6701574822": {"Name": "Leal P.R.L.", "AuthorID": "6701574822", "AffiliationID": "60102126", "AffiliationName": "University of Lyon"}, "7003637906": {"Name": "Nurmikko T.", "AuthorID": "7003637906", "AffiliationID": "60160417, 60103483", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience Research Centre, Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust"}, "14020024800": {"Name": "Obermann M.", "AuthorID": "14020024800", "AffiliationID": "115748360", "AffiliationName": "Center for Neurology, Asklepios Hospitals Schildautal"}, "24293056600": {"Name": "Cruccu G.", "AuthorID": "24293056600", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Neuroscience, Sapienza University"}}}
