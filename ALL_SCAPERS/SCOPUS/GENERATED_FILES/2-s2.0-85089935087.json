Deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks can be employed for this assignment with different training strategies: leveraging pre-trained models as baselines; training from scratch with the target dataset; or fine-tuning from the pre-trained model. Although there are separate systems used for learning features from labelled and unlabelled data, there are few models combining all available information. Therefore, in this paper, we present a novel semi-supervised deep network training strategy that comprises a convolutional network and an autoencoder using a joint classification and reconstruction loss function. We show our network improves the learned feature embedding when including the unlabelled data in the training process. The results using the feature embedding obtained by our network achieve better classification accuracy when compared with competing methods, as well as offering good generalisation in the context of transfer learning. Furthermore, the proposed network ensemble and loss function is highly extensible and applicable in many recognition tasks.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Feature generalisation", "Semi-supervised learning", "Transfer learning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Classification accuracy", "Convolutional networks", "Feature embedding", "Learning methods", "Network ensemble", "Network training", "Training process", "Training strategy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089935087", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"57207845185": {"Name": "dos Santos F.P.", "AuthorID": "57207845185", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Mathematical and Computer Sciences (ICMC), University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP)"}, "6604059264": {"Name": "Ponti M.A.", "AuthorID": "6604059264", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Mathematical and Computer Sciences (ICMC), University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP)"}, "34871084000": {"Name": "Zor C.", "AuthorID": "34871084000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC), University College London"}, "7102315971": {"Name": "Kittler J.", "AuthorID": "7102315971", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing (CVSSP), University of Surrey"}}}
