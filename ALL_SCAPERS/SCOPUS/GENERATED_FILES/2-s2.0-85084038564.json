First, to examine how the negative environmental consequences of intensive agriculture have driven China and the UK to shift away from narrowly focused farm output policies and adopt more holistic green development pathways. Second, to explore the policy objectives they have in common. Third, to assess the numerous opportunities for joint research and knowledge sharing through the Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network and other existing institutional mechanisms. The intensification of agricultural production in the UK started several decades earlier than in China as did the negative environmental consequences of the farm practices. However, their strategies and policies for sustainable intensification and green development have much in common. These are set out in two main documents: the Chinese State Council guidelines for green agriculture and the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 25 Year Environment Plan. There are substantial mutual advantages from greater collaboration on problem identification and monitoring; the development of appropriate technological and management responses and the formulation of sound policies. To achieve this potential, it is recommended that further thought be given to how best to bring together all of the key stakeholders along the whole food chain.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Agriculture green development", "China", "Policy", "UK"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084038564", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Veterinary (all)", "VETE", "3400"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"55745536200": {"Name": "Lu Y.", "AuthorID": "55745536200", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of International Development, University of East Anglia"}, "6602688462": {"Name": "Norse D.", "AuthorID": "6602688462", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Sustainable Resources, University College London"}, "7004761224": {"Name": "Powlson D.", "AuthorID": "7004761224", "AffiliationID": "60002793", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sustainable Agriculture Sciences, Rothamsted Research"}}}
