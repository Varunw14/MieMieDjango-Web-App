We aimed to compare the PRECISE score with clinical progression in patients who are managed using an MRI-led AS protocol. Methods: A total of 553 patients on AS for low- and intermediate-risk PCa (up to Gleason score 3 + 4) who had two or more MRI scans performed between December 2005 and January 2020 were included. Overall, 2161 scans were retrospectively re-reported by a dedicated radiologist to give a PI-RADS v2 score for each scan and assess the PRECISE score for each follow-up scan. Clinical progression was defined by histological progression to \u2265 Gleason score 4 + 3 (Gleason Grade Group 3) and/or initiation of active treatment. Progression-free survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test was used to assess differences between curves. Results: Overall, 165/553 (30%) patients experienced the primary outcome of clinical progression (median follow-up, 74.5 months; interquartile ranges, 53\u201398). Of all patients, 313/553 (57%) did not show radiological progression on MRI (PRECISE 1\u20133), of which 296/313 (95%) had also no clinical progression. Of the remaining 240/553 patients (43%) with radiological progression on MRI (PRECISE 4\u20135), 146/240 (61%) experienced clinical progression (p < 0.0001). Patients with radiological progression on MRI (PRECISE 4-5) showed a trend to an increase in PSA density. Conclusions: Patients without radiological progression on MRI (PRECISE 1-3) during AS had a very low likelihood of clinical progression and many could avoid routine re-biopsy. Key Points: \u2022 Patients without radiological progression on MRI (PRECISE 1\u20133) during AS had a very low likelihood of clinical progression and many could avoid routine re-biopsy. \u2022 Clinical progression was almost always detectable in patients with radiological progression on MRI (PRECISE 4\u20135) during AS. \u2022 Patients with radiological progression on MRI (PRECISE 4\u20135) during AS showed a trend to an increase in PSA density.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biopsy", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Prostatic neoplasms", "Urogenital neoplasms"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091724877", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"55646665800": {"Name": "Giganti F.", "AuthorID": "55646665800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London"}, "57219218293": {"Name": "Retter A.", "AuthorID": "57219218293", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London"}, "17036141700": {"Name": "Punwani S.", "AuthorID": "17036141700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "7402266611": {"Name": "Allen C.", "AuthorID": "7402266611", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "15053220400": {"Name": "Kirkham A.", "AuthorID": "15053220400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57169977600": {"Name": "Stabile A.", "AuthorID": "57169977600", "AffiliationID": "60009622", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology and Division of Experimental Oncology, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University"}, "43761516900": {"Name": "Stavrinides V.", "AuthorID": "43761516900", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "40462139200": {"Name": "Osinibi E.", "AuthorID": "40462139200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London"}, "55199046500": {"Name": "Orczyk C.", "AuthorID": "55199046500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004667094": {"Name": "Emberton M.", "AuthorID": "7004667094", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7402982572": {"Name": "Moore C.M.", "AuthorID": "7402982572", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7003270861": {"Name": "Panebianco V.", "AuthorID": "7003270861", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiological Sciences, Oncology and Pathology, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "35392109800": {"Name": "Trock B.J.", "AuthorID": "35392109800", "AffiliationID": "60001117, 60006433", "AffiliationName": "The James Buchanan Brady Urological Institute and Department of Urology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"}, "8972541300": {"Name": "Freeman A.", "AuthorID": "8972541300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57205198360": {"Name": "Haider A.", "AuthorID": "57205198360", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
