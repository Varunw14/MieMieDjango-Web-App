However, the OAC utilisation in AF patients with dementia or cognitive impairment (CI) is limited. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of OAC prescriptions in AF patients with dementia/CI and to identify factors associated with OAC treatment within 180 days after dementia/CI diagnosis. Methods: Using The Health Improvement Network database, the annual trends of OAC between 2000 and 2015 were calculated. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with OAC treatment. Results: The prevalence rate of OAC prescriptions increased from 6.1% in 2000 to 45.9% in 2015. Among OAC users, the proportion of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) use increased significantly from 0.1% in 2011 to 33.8% in 2015 (P-trend < 0.001), while the proportion of vitamin K antagonist use decreased by 28.6% from 100% in 2000 to 71.4% in 2015 (P-trend < 0.001). In the multivariable analysis, younger age, very old age, female sex, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index, having a HAS-BLED score \u22653, a history of intracranial bleeding, falls and polypharmacy were significantly associated with lower odds of receiving OAC. Conclusions: In UK primary care, OAC use increased from 2000 to 2015 in AF patients with dementia/CI, with a substantial increase in use of DOACs. Characteristics related to frailty are associated with lower odds of OAC prescription. Given the increasing use of DOACs in patients with dementia/CI, further studies are needed to investigate the safety and effectiveness of DOACs in this important patient group.", "AuthorKeywords": ["atrial fibrillation", "cognitive impairment", "dementia", "direct oral anticoagulant", "oral anticoagulant", "warfarin"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088385144", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57193860094": {"Name": "Mongkhon P.", "AuthorID": "57193860094", "AffiliationID": "60000881", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacoepidemiology and Statistics Research Center (PESRC), Faculty of Pharmacy, Chiang Mai University"}, "18536454500": {"Name": "Kongkaew C.", "AuthorID": "18536454500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Practice and Policy, School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57211478307": {"Name": "Alwafi H.", "AuthorID": "57211478307", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Practice and Policy, School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "56825520900": {"Name": "Fanning L.", "AuthorID": "56825520900", "AffiliationID": "60010945, 60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Eastern Health Clinical School, Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences, Monash University"}, "55499786000": {"Name": "Lau W.C.Y.", "AuthorID": "55499786000", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong"}, "8448863300": {"Name": "Wei L.", "AuthorID": "8448863300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Practice and Policy, School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7102513915": {"Name": "Wong I.C.K.", "AuthorID": "7102513915", "AffiliationID": "60114500", "AffiliationName": "The University of Hong Kong Shenzhen Hospital"}}}
