However, in the past decade multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, multiparametric ultrasound and image fusion targeting have come to the fore. Here we present the state-of-the-art diagnostic strategies in prostate cancer detection and examine the case for target-only biopsy, as well as the benefits and limitations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["image fusion", "multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging", "prostate cancer", "targeted prostate biopsy", "ultrasound"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Humans", "Image-Guided Biopsy", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Prostatic Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078193012", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57214602663": {"Name": "Tam J.O.", "AuthorID": "57214602663", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial Prostate, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "8147855500": {"Name": "Ahmed H.U.", "AuthorID": "8147855500", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial Prostate, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}}}
