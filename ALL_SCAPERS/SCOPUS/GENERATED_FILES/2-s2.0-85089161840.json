This highlights the need for evidence-based design guidelines for sensorimotor interactions that meaningfully exploit action-based experiences, that are instrumental in shaping the way we conceptualise the world. These sensorimotor experiences are particularly important for young children as they can provide them with an embodied toolkit of resources (independent of language skills or subject specific vocabulary) that they can draw upon to support science \u2018think\u2019 and \u2018talk\u2019, using their own bodies to develop and express ideas through gesture, that are grounded on sensorimotoric representations from action experiences. Taking an iterative design-based research (DBR) approach [2], this paper reports the design, development and deployment of a programme of outdoor activities for children aged 4\u20136 years, that drew on embodied cognition theory to foster meaningful action in relation to ideas of air resistance. This research is relevant to researchers, practitioners and designers. It makes a contribution to learning experience design by making explicit the process of applying key components of embodied cognition theory to the design of science learning activities for early years, and how this can effectively inform digital design.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Digital design", "Early years science", "Embodied cognition"], "IndexKeywords": ["Embodied cognition", "Embodied cognition theories", "Evidence-based designs", "Iterative design", "Learning experiences", "Outdoor activities", "Science learning", "Subject-specific"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089161840", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57218423709": {"Name": "Thomas Jha R.", "AuthorID": "57218423709", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "16234800800": {"Name": "Price S.", "AuthorID": "16234800800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57218423987": {"Name": "Motion A.", "AuthorID": "57218423987", "AffiliationID": "121251925", "AffiliationName": "Learning Through Landscapes"}}}
