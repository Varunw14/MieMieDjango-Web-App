Globally, where more than 90% of the early childhood education and care workforce is female, understanding the attitudes of the majority is critical in informing actions to sustain men\u2019s participation. So too are female educators\u2019 understanding, acceptance and responses to the attitudes of other key stakeholders. The extent to which decisions in the workplace reflect personal, organisational or parent perspectives is not well understood. In this study, the authors analyse interview data from the female majority to distinguish personal voice and attributed beliefs regarding the inclusion of men in the early childhood education and care workplace. They analyse interview data from 96 women working as educators in a representative sample of long-day-care and kindergarten services in Queensland, Australia. The analyses suggest that the view of male educators as assets was claimed, while concerns about risk or competency were typically attributed to others. Attributed views were not often contested, but instead accepted or excused. The findings suggest that while the inclusion of men in the early childhood education and care workforce is explicitly accepted by female colleagues, actions within the workforce may be influenced by the attitudes of those outside or by latent personal attitudes distanced by positioning as the voice of others.", "AuthorKeywords": ["diversity", "early childhood", "gender", "men", "occupational sex segregation", "workforce"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087047657", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"57192805444": {"Name": "Sullivan V.", "AuthorID": "57192805444", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "The University of Queensland"}, "56906760900": {"Name": "Coles L.", "AuthorID": "56906760900", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "The University of Queensland"}, "57217550226": {"Name": "Perales F.", "AuthorID": "57217550226", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "The University of Queensland"}, "7005368242": {"Name": "Thorpe K.", "AuthorID": "7005368242", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "The University of Queensland"}, "57194274769": {"Name": "Xu Y.", "AuthorID": "57194274769", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
