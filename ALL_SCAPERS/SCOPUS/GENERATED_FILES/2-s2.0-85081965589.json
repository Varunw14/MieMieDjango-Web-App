Materials and methods: T2-weighted, T1 mapping, and oxygen-enhanced T1 maps were acquired before and after 8\u201310 fractions of chemoradiotherapy and examined whether the oxygen-enhanced MRI response relates to clinical outcome. Patient response to treatment was assessed 3 months following completion of chemoradiotherapy. A mean T1 was extracted from manually segmented tumour regions of interest and a paired two-tailed t-test was used to compare changes across the patient population. Regions of subcutaneous fat and muscle tissue were examined as control ROIs. Results: There was a significant increase in T1 of the tumour ROIs across patients following the 8\u201310 fractions of chemoradiotherapy (paired t-test, p < 0.001, n = 7). At baseline, prior to receiving chemoradiotherapy, there were no significant changes in T1 across patients from breathing oxygen (n = 9). In the post-chemoRT scans (8\u201310 fractions), there was a significant decrease in T1 of the tumour ROIs across patients when breathing 100% oxygen (paired t-test, p < 0.001, n = 8). Out of the 12 patients from which we successfully acquired a visit 1 T1-map, only 1 patient did not respond to treatment, therefore, we cannot correlate these results with clinical outcome. Conclusions: These clinical data demonstrate feasibility and potential for T1-mapping and oxygen enhanced T1-mapping to indicate perfusion or treatment response in tumours of this nature. These data show promise for future work with a larger cohort containing more non-responders, which would allow us to relate these measurements to clinical outcome.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chemoradiotherapy", "Hypoxia", "MOLLI T1-Mapping", "MRI", "Oxygen Enhanced MRI (OE-MRI)", "Tumour"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081965589", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"56893714900": {"Name": "Bluemke E.", "AuthorID": "56893714900", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University of Oxford"}, "54790572200": {"Name": "Bulte D.", "AuthorID": "54790572200", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University of Oxford"}, "57215816591": {"Name": "Bertrand A.", "AuthorID": "57215816591", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University of Oxford"}, "57220704988": {"Name": "George B.", "AuthorID": "57220704988", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University of Oxford"}, "57211947671": {"Name": "Jacobs C.", "AuthorID": "57211947671", "AffiliationID": "60170323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "26121313200": {"Name": "Muirhead R.", "AuthorID": "26121313200", "AffiliationID": "60170323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57220612806": {"Name": "Cooke R.", "AuthorID": "57220612806", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, CRUK/MRC Oxford Institute for Radiation Oncology, University of Oxford"}, "55669470400": {"Name": "Chu K.Y.", "AuthorID": "55669470400", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, CRUK/MRC Oxford Institute for Radiation Oncology, University of Oxford"}, "56572376200": {"Name": "Durrant L.", "AuthorID": "56572376200", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, CRUK/MRC Oxford Institute for Radiation Oncology, University of Oxford"}, "7004035095": {"Name": "Goh V.", "AuthorID": "7004035095", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, CRUK/MRC Oxford Institute for Radiation Oncology, University of Oxford"}, "57205125746": {"Name": "Ng S.M.", "AuthorID": "57205125746", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, CRUK/MRC Oxford Institute for Radiation Oncology, University of Oxford"}, "55427619500": {"Name": "Strauss V.Y.", "AuthorID": "55427619500", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Statistics in Medicine, NDORMS, University of Oxford"}, "9275515900": {"Name": "Hawkins M.A.", "AuthorID": "9275515900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
