Antimicrobial stewardship may be perceived as utilitarian rationing, seeking to preserve the availability of effective antimicrobials by limiting the development of resistance in a manner which could conflict with the immediate treatment of the patient in need. This view does not account for the growing evidence of antimicrobial-associated harm to individual patients. This review sets out the evidence for antimicrobial-associated harm and how this should be balanced with the need for prompt and appropriate therapy in infection. It describes the mechanisms by which antimicrobials may harm patients including: mitochondrial toxicity; immune cell toxicity; adverse drug reactions; selection of resistant organisms within a given patient; and disruption of the microbiome. Finally, the article indicates how the harms of antimicrobials may be mitigated and identifies areas for research and development in this field.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antibiotics", "Antifungals", "Critical care", "Drug-related side effects and adverse reactions"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Infective Agents", "Antimicrobial Stewardship", "Critical Care", "Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions", "Humans", "Medical Overuse", "Microbiota", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078740462", "SubjectAreas": [["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"]], "AuthorData": {"23975738700": {"Name": "Arulkumaran N.", "AuthorID": "23975738700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bloomsbury Institute for Intensive Care Medicine, University College"}, "57214457626": {"Name": "Routledge M.", "AuthorID": "57214457626", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "9242874600": {"Name": "Schlebusch S.", "AuthorID": "9242874600", "AffiliationID": "60000664", "AffiliationName": "Forensic and Scientific Services, Queensland Health"}, "16309861300": {"Name": "Lipman J.", "AuthorID": "16309861300", "AffiliationID": "60108488, 60000292", "AffiliationName": "Scientific Consultant, Nimes University Hospital University of Montpellier"}, "57190507077": {"Name": "Conway Morris A.", "AuthorID": "57190507077", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60017488", "AffiliationName": "Division of Anaesthesia, Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge"}}}
