{"Title": "Arthritogenic alphavirus vaccines: Serogrouping versus cross-protection in mouse models", "Year": 2020, "Source": "Vaccines", "Volume": "8", "Issue": 2, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": null, "PageEnd": null, "CitedBy": 1, "DOI": "10.3390/vaccines8020209", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85085197699&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2020 by the authors. licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Ross River virus (RRV), o\u2019nyong nyong virus (ONNV), Mayaro virus (MAYV) and Getah virus (GETV) represent arthritogenic alphaviruses belonging to the Semliki Forest virus antigenic complex. Antibodies raised against one of these viruses can cross-react with other serogroup members, suggesting that, for instance, a CHIKV vaccine (deemed commercially viable) might provide cross-protection against antigenically related alphaviruses. Herein we use human alphavirus isolates (including a new human RRV isolate) and wild-type mice to explore whether infection with one virus leads to cross-protection against viremia after challenge with other members of the antigenic complex. Persistently infected Rag1-/- mice were also used to assess the cross-protective capacity of convalescent CHIKV serum. We also assessed the ability of a recombinant poxvirus-based CHIKV vaccine and a commercially available formalin-fixed, whole-virus GETV vaccine to induce cross-protective responses. Although cross-protection and/or cross-reactivity were clearly evident, they were not universal and were often suboptimal. Even for the more closely related viruses (e.g., CHIKV and ONNV, or RRV and GETV), vaccine-mediated neutralization and/or protection against the intended homologous target was significantly more effective than cross-neutralization and/or cross-protection against the heterologous virus. Effective vaccine-mediated cross-protection would thus likely require a higher dose and/or more vaccinations, which is likely to be unattractive to regulators and vaccine manufacturers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chikungunya virus", "Getah virus", "Mayaro virus", "O\u2019nyong nyong virus", "Ross River virus"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085197699", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57216894197": {"Name": "Nguyen W.", "AuthorID": "57216894197", "AffiliationID": "60025029", "AffiliationName": "Inflammation Biology Group, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute"}, "36151123600": {"Name": "Nakayama E.", "AuthorID": "36151123600", "AffiliationID": "60030650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Virology I, National Institute of Infectious Diseases"}, "57201378684": {"Name": "Yan K.", "AuthorID": "57201378684", "AffiliationID": "60025029", "AffiliationName": "Inflammation Biology Group, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute"}, "57191630160": {"Name": "Tang B.", "AuthorID": "57191630160", "AffiliationID": "60025029", "AffiliationName": "Inflammation Biology Group, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute"}, "26652059300": {"Name": "Le T.T.", "AuthorID": "26652059300", "AffiliationID": "60025029", "AffiliationName": "Inflammation Biology Group, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute"}, "56644996100": {"Name": "Rawle D.J.", "AuthorID": "56644996100", "AffiliationID": "60025029", "AffiliationName": "Inflammation Biology Group, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute"}, "8625929400": {"Name": "Lutzky V.P.", "AuthorID": "8625929400", "AffiliationID": "60025029", "AffiliationName": "Inflammation Biology Group, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute"}, "16310418700": {"Name": "Prow N.A.", "AuthorID": "16310418700", "AffiliationID": "60160422", "AffiliationName": "Australian Infectious Disease Research Centre"}, "7006137200": {"Name": "Suhrbier A.", "AuthorID": "7006137200", "AffiliationID": "60160422", "AffiliationName": "Australian Infectious Disease Research Centre"}, "57194063314": {"Name": "Liu L.", "AuthorID": "57194063314", "AffiliationID": "60031846", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Therapeutics Laboratory, School of Pharmacy & Medical Sciences, University of South Australia Cancer Research Institute"}, "57196921794": {"Name": "Cooper T.H.", "AuthorID": "57196921794", "AffiliationID": "60031846", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Therapeutics Laboratory, School of Pharmacy & Medical Sciences, University of South Australia Cancer Research Institute"}, "6701521105": {"Name": "Hayball J.D.", "AuthorID": "6701521105", "AffiliationID": "60031846", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Therapeutics Laboratory, School of Pharmacy & Medical Sciences, University of South Australia Cancer Research Institute"}, "57216801585": {"Name": "Faddy H.M.", "AuthorID": "57216801585", "AffiliationID": "123672321", "AffiliationName": "Research and Development Laboratory, Australian Red Cross Lifeblood"}, "6602829171": {"Name": "Warrilow D.", "AuthorID": "6602829171", "AffiliationID": "60000664", "AffiliationName": "Public Health Virology Laboratory, Queensland Health Forensic and Scientific Services"}, "7003764659": {"Name": "Allcock R.J.N.", "AuthorID": "7003764659", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Western Australia"}, "8616438600": {"Name": "Hobson-Peters J.", "AuthorID": "8616438600", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences, University of Queensland"}, "35518251800": {"Name": "Hall R.A.", "AuthorID": "35518251800", "AffiliationID": "60160422", "AffiliationName": "Australian Infectious Disease Research Centre"}, "7402037908": {"Name": "Young P.", "AuthorID": "7402037908", "AffiliationID": "60160422", "AffiliationName": "Australian Infectious Disease Research Centre"}, "7005130384": {"Name": "Oliveira N.M.", "AuthorID": "7005130384", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "Deptartment of Microbiology, University of Western Australia"}, "35262242900": {"Name": "Hartel G.", "AuthorID": "35262242900", "AffiliationID": "60025029", "AffiliationName": "Statistics Unit, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute"}, "57202713949": {"Name": "Howley P.M.", "AuthorID": "57202713949", "AffiliationID": "118436265", "AffiliationName": "Sementis Ltd"}}}
