Published by Oxford University Press in association with the International Society for Quality in Health Care.Objective: The aim was to translate the findings of the QUASER study into a reflective, dialogic guide to help senior hospital leaders develop an organization wide QI strategy. Design: The QUASER study involved in depth ethnographic research into QI work and practices in two hospitals in each of five European countries. Three translational stakeholder workshops were held to review research findings and advise on the design of the Guide. An extended iterative process involving researchers from each participant country was then used to populate the Guide. Setting: The research was carried out in two hospitals in each of five European countries. Participants: In total, 389 interviews with healthcare practitioners and 803 hours of observations. Intervention: None. Main outcome measure: None. Results: The QUASER Hospital Guide was designed for leadership teams to diagnose their organization's strengths and weaknesses in the eight QI challenges. The Guide supports organizational dialogue about QI challenges, enables leaders to share perspectives, and helps teams to develop solutions to their situated problems. The Guide includes extensive examples of QI strategies drawn from the data and is published online and on paper. Conclusions: The QUASER Hospital Guide is empirically based, draws on a dialogical approach to Organizational Development and complexity science and can facilitate hospital leadership teams to identify the best solutions for their organization.", "AuthorKeywords": ["hospital care", "leadership", "patient safety", "Quality improvement", "quality improvement guide", "translational research"], "IndexKeywords": ["Europe", "Hospital Administration", "Hospitals", "Humans", "Leadership", "Patient Safety", "Quality Improvement", "Quality of Health Care", "Translational Medical Research"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077719772", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"35315321500": {"Name": "Anderson J.E.", "AuthorID": "35315321500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing, Midwifery and Palliative Care, King's College London, James Clerk Maxwell Building"}, "7103269887": {"Name": "Robert G.", "AuthorID": "7103269887", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing, Midwifery and Palliative Care, King's College London, James Clerk Maxwell Building"}, "15849990200": {"Name": "Burnett S.", "AuthorID": "15849990200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Honorary Research Fellow, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College"}, "23396135100": {"Name": "Bal R.", "AuthorID": "23396135100", "AffiliationID": "60022265", "AffiliationName": "Erasmus School of Health Policy and Management, Erasmus University Rotterdam"}, "54387197600": {"Name": "Nunes F.", "AuthorID": "54387197600", "AffiliationID": "60028300", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Resources and Organizational Behavior, ISCTE-IUL"}, "23487726400": {"Name": "Aase K.", "AuthorID": "23487726400", "AffiliationID": "60014497", "AffiliationName": "Share - Centre for Resilience in Healthcare, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Stavanger"}, "24726108200": {"Name": "Wiig S.", "AuthorID": "24726108200", "AffiliationID": "60014497", "AffiliationName": "Share - Centre for Resilience in Healthcare, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Stavanger"}, "55183905200": {"Name": "Karltun A.", "AuthorID": "55183905200", "AffiliationID": "60016471", "AffiliationName": "Department of Industrial Engineering and Management, J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping University Sweden, J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping Academy for Improvement of Healthcare and Welfare"}, "24503490800": {"Name": "Sanne J.", "AuthorID": "24503490800", "AffiliationID": "60012636", "AffiliationName": "Ivl Swedish Environmental Research Institute"}, "7003777671": {"Name": "Fulop N.J.", "AuthorID": "7003777671", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}}}
