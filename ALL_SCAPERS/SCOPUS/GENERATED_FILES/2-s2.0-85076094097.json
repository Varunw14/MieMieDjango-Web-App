However, neurocognitive outcome is suboptimal. This study aimed to investigate behavior problems and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) in NTBC-dietary-treated TT1 and to relate this to phenylalanine and tyrosine concentrations. Results: Thirty-one TT1 patients (19 males; mean age 13.9 \u00b1 5.3 years) were included in this study. Emotional and behavioral problems, as measured by the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment, were present in almost all domains. Attention and thought problems were particularly evident. HR-QoL was assessed by the TNO AZL Children's and Adults QoL questionnaires. Poorer HR-QoL as compared to reference populations was observed for the domains: independent daily functioning, cognitive functioning and school performance, social contacts, motor functioning, and vitality. Both internalizing and externalizing behavior problems were associated with low phenylalanine (and associated lower tyrosine) concentrations during the first year of life. In contrast, high tyrosine (and associated higher phenylalanine) concentrations during life and specifically the last year before testing were associated with more internalizing behavior and/or HR-QoL problems. Conclusions: TT1 patients showed several behavior problems and a lower HR-QoL. Associations with metabolic control differed for different age periods. This suggests the need for continuous fine-tuning and monitoring of dietary treatment to keep phenylalanine and tyrosine concentrations within target ranges in NTBC-treated TT1 patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Behavior problems", "Health related-quality of life", "Phenylalanine", "Tyrosine", "Tyrosinemia type 1"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Child", "Cyclohexanones", "Humans", "Male", "Nitrobenzoates", "Phenylalanine", "Quality of Life", "Tyrosine", "Tyrosinemias", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076094097", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57210833467": {"Name": "Van Vliet K.", "AuthorID": "57210833467", "AffiliationID": "60070240, 60010023, 60006027", "AffiliationName": "Beatrix Children's Hospital, Groningen, Division of Metabolic Diseases, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen"}, "56541412000": {"Name": "Van Ginkel W.G.", "AuthorID": "56541412000", "AffiliationID": "60070240, 60010023, 60006027", "AffiliationName": "Beatrix Children's Hospital, Groningen, Division of Metabolic Diseases, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen"}, "36172274900": {"Name": "Jahja R.", "AuthorID": "36172274900", "AffiliationID": "60070240, 60010023, 60006027", "AffiliationName": "Beatrix Children's Hospital, Groningen, Division of Metabolic Diseases, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen"}, "7004049767": {"Name": "Van Spronsen F.J.", "AuthorID": "7004049767", "AffiliationID": "60070240, 60010023, 60006027", "AffiliationName": "Beatrix Children's Hospital, Groningen, Division of Metabolic Diseases, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen"}, "57203175841": {"Name": "Daly A.", "AuthorID": "57203175841", "AffiliationID": "60022357", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Children's Hospital"}, "7401581465": {"Name": "MacDonald A.", "AuthorID": "7401581465", "AffiliationID": "60022357", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Children's Hospital"}, "35432313300": {"Name": "McKiernan P.J.", "AuthorID": "35432313300", "AffiliationID": "60022357", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Children's Hospital"}, "8523444700": {"Name": "De Laet C.", "AuthorID": "8523444700", "AffiliationID": "60023548, 60000145", "AffiliationName": "H\u00f4pital Universitaire des Enfants Reine Fabiola, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles"}, "6701326362": {"Name": "Goyens P.J.", "AuthorID": "6701326362", "AffiliationID": "60023548, 60000145", "AffiliationName": "H\u00f4pital Universitaire des Enfants Reine Fabiola, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles"}, "57208699708": {"Name": "Vara R.", "AuthorID": "57208699708", "AffiliationID": "60107269", "AffiliationName": "Evelina London Children's Hospital"}, "55401987000": {"Name": "Rahman Y.", "AuthorID": "55401987000", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Guy's and St. Thomas' Hospital"}, "6602482113": {"Name": "Cassiman D.", "AuthorID": "6602482113", "AffiliationID": "60031069, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital Gasthuisberg, University of Leuven"}, "6603373921": {"Name": "Eyskens F.", "AuthorID": "6603373921", "AffiliationID": "60013703", "AffiliationName": "Kon.
