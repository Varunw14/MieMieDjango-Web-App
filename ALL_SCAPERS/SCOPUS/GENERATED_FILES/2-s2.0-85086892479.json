The impact of different urban land-uses on air temperatures is well-documented by many studies focusing on the urban heat island phenomenon; however, an integrated study of air temperature and humidity, i.e., the human-perceived temperatures, in different land-use areas is essential to understand the impact of hot and humid tropical urban climates on the thermal comfort of urban dwellers for an appraisal of potential health risks and the associated building energy use potential. In this study, we show through near-surface monitoring how these factors vary in distinct land-use areas of Kuala Lumpur city, characterized by different morphological features (high-rise vs. low-rise; compact vs. open), level of anthropogenic heating and evapotranspiration (built-up vs. green areas), and building materials (concrete buildings vs. traditional Malay homes in timber) based on the calculated heat index (HI), apparent temperature (TApp) and equivalent temperature (TE) values in wet and dry seasons. The results show that the felt-like temperatures are almost always higher than the air temperatures in all land-use areas, and this difference is highest in daytime temperatures in green areas during the dry season, by up to about 8 \u00b0C (HI)/5 \u00b0C (TApp). The TE values are also up to 9% higher in these areas than in built-up areas. We conclude that tackling urban heat island without compromising thermal comfort levels, hence encouraging energy use reduction in buildings to cope with outdoor conditions requires a careful management of humidity levels, as well as a careful selection of building morphology and materials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Land-use", "Thermal comfort", "Tropics", "Urban microclimate"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anthropogenic heating", "Equivalent temperature", "Hygro-thermal conditions", "Morphological features", "Outdoor thermal comfort", "Perceived temperature", "Potential health risks", "Thermal comfort level"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086892479", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (miscellaneous)", "ENVI", "2301"]], "AuthorData": {"56254804900": {"Name": "Aktas Y.D.", "AuthorID": "56254804900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering (CEGE), University College London (UCL)"}, "55547129784": {"Name": "Wang K.", "AuthorID": "55547129784", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering (CEGE), University College London (UCL)"}, "57217248047": {"Name": "Zhou Y.", "AuthorID": "57217248047", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering (CEGE), University College London (UCL)"}, "57211644046": {"Name": "D'Ayala D.", "AuthorID": "57211644046", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering (CEGE), University College London (UCL)"}, "55314891800": {"Name": "Othman M.", "AuthorID": "55314891800", "AffiliationID": "60001821", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Environment and Development (LESTARI), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM)"}, "7006150217": {"Name": "Stocker J.", "AuthorID": "7006150217", "AffiliationID": "60159401", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Environmental Research Consultants (CERC)"}, "56701575900": {"Name": "Jackson M.", "AuthorID": "56701575900", "AffiliationID": "60159401", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Environmental Research Consultants (CERC)"}, "55541665200": {"Name": "Hood C.", "AuthorID": "55541665200", "AffiliationID": "60159401", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Environmental Research Consultants (CERC)"}, "7005297975": {"Name": "Carruthers D.", "AuthorID": "7005297975", "AffiliationID": "60159401", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Environmental Research Consultants (CERC)"}, "57218373467": {"Name": "Latif M.T.", "AuthorID": "57218373467", "AffiliationID": "60001821", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences and Environment, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM)"}, "7402692536": {"Name": "Hunt J.", "AuthorID": "7402692536", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL), Earth Sciences"}}}
