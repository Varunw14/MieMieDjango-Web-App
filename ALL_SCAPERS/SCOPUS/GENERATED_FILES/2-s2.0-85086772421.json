During development, macrophages prune transient or unnecessary synapses in neuronal development, and prune blood vessels in vascular development, facilitating appropriate tissue remodeling. In the present study, we identified that macrophages contributed to the development of pupillary morphology. Csf1op/op mutant mice, in which ocular macrophages are nearly absent, exhibited abnormal pupillary edges, with abnormal protrusions of excess iris tissue into the pupillary space. Macrophages located near the pupillary edge engulfed pigmented debris, which likely consisted of unnecessary iris protrusions that emerge during smoothening of the pupillary edge. Indeed, pupillary edge macrophages phenotypically possessed some features of M2 macrophages, consistent with robust tissue engulfment and remodeling activities. Interestingly, protruding irises in Csf1op/op mice were only detected in gaps between regressing blood vessels. Taken together, our findings uncovered a new role for ocular macrophages, demonstrating that this cell population is important for iris pruning during development.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Angiogenesis", "Dll4", "Macrophage", "Pupillary membrane", "Retina", "VEGF"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor", "Macrophages", "Mice", "Mice, Mutant Strains", "Pupil"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086772421", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57217219287": {"Name": "Takahashi M.", "AuthorID": "57217219287", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Dentistry and Oral Surgery"}, "57217216029": {"Name": "Misaki M.", "AuthorID": "57217216029", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy"}, "57202579247": {"Name": "Iga T.", "AuthorID": "57202579247", "AffiliationID": "60025252", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Keio University School of Medicine"}, "56045492200": {"Name": "Tai-Nagara I.", "AuthorID": "56045492200", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy"}, "57217218895": {"Name": "Hirata A.", "AuthorID": "57217218895", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy"}, "57217216067": {"Name": "Ogawa M.", "AuthorID": "57217216067", "AffiliationID": "60003181", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Tokyo Medical University"}, "8730128900": {"Name": "Kubota Y.", "AuthorID": "8730128900", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy"}, "7404044513": {"Name": "Nakagawa T.", "AuthorID": "7404044513", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Dentistry and Oral Surgery"}, "8300944200": {"Name": "Shibata S.", "AuthorID": "8300944200", "AffiliationID": "101970034", "AffiliationName": "Electron Microscope Laboratory"}, "57208900415": {"Name": "Shindo T.", "AuthorID": "57208900415", "AffiliationID": "101970034", "AffiliationName": "Electron Microscope Laboratory"}, "7403473378": {"Name": "Miyamoto T.", "AuthorID": "7403473378", "AffiliationID": "60021120", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Kumamoto University"}, "7006764640": {"Name": "Ema M.", "AuthorID": "7006764640", "AffiliationID": "108231178", "AffiliationName": "Department of Stem Cells and Human Disease Models, Research Center for Animal Life Science"}, "6701589218": {"Name": "Ichiyama Y.", "AuthorID": "6701589218", "AffiliationID": "60007524", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Shiga University of Medical Science"}, "7004710153": {"Name": "Shima D.T.", "AuthorID": "7004710153", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Vision Research, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "7006397221": {"Name": "Hozumi K.", "AuthorID": "7006397221", "AffiliationID": "60028799", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology, Tokai University School of Medicine"}, "57220828080": {"Name": "Nishimura S.", "AuthorID": "57220828080", "AffiliationID": "60102128", "AffiliationName": "Jichi Medical University"}}}
