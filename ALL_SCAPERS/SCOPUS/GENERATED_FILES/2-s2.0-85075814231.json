As both EO and NPD are heritable central nervous system disorders, we assessed the prevalence of protein-truncating variants (PTVs) and copy number variants (CNVs) in genes/regions previously implicated in NPD in adults with EO (n = 149) referred for weight loss/bariatric surgery. We also assessed the prevalence of CNVs in patients referred to University College London Hospital (UCLH) with EO (n = 218) and obesity (O) (BMI 35-50 kg/m2; n5374) and a Swedish cohort of participants from the community with predominantly O (n = 161). The prevalence of variants was compared with control subjects in the Exome Aggregation Consortium/ Genome Aggregation Database. In the discovery cohort (highNPD prevalence: 77%), the cumulative PTV/CNV allele frequency (AF) was 7.7% vs. 2.6%in control subjects (odds ratio [OR] 3.1 [95% CI 2-4.1]; P < 0.0001). In the UCLH EO cohort (intermediate NPD prevalence: 47%), CNV AF (1.8% vs. 0.9% in control subjects; OR 1.95 [95% CI 0.96-3.93]; P50.06) was lower than the discovery cohort. CNV AFwas not increased in the UCLH O cohort (0.8%). No CNVs were identified in the Swedish cohort with no NPD. These findings suggest that PTV/CNVs, in genes/regions previously associated with NPD, may contribute to NPD in patients with EO.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Comorbidity", "DNA Copy Number Variations", "Female", "Gene Frequency", "Genetic Association Studies", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Middle Aged", "Obesity", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Sweden", "Whole Exome Sequencing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075814231", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"]], "AuthorData": {"55894476100": {"Name": "Stahel P.", "AuthorID": "55894476100", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Banting and Best Diabetes Centre, University of Toronto"}, "57210464172": {"Name": "Nahmias A.", "AuthorID": "57210464172", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Banting and Best Diabetes Centre, University of Toronto"}, "57203967737": {"Name": "Sud S.K.", "AuthorID": "57203967737", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Banting and Best Diabetes Centre, University of Toronto"}, "57203971795": {"Name": "Lee S.J.", "AuthorID": "57203971795", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Banting and Best Diabetes Centre, University of Toronto"}, "55175451600": {"Name": "Dash S.", "AuthorID": "55175451600", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Banting and Best Diabetes Centre, University of Toronto"}, "37102604700": {"Name": "Pucci A.", "AuthorID": "37102604700", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, University College London"}, "35346116700": {"Name": "Yousseif A.", "AuthorID": "35346116700", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, University College London"}, "7004418512": {"Name": "Batterham R.L.", "AuthorID": "7004418512", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, University College London"}, "57212055972": {"Name": "Youseff A.", "AuthorID": "57212055972", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Medical Science, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto"}, "7401595231": {"Name": "Jackson T.", "AuthorID": "7401595231", "AffiliationID": "60014468", "AffiliationName": "Division of General Surgery, University Health Network"}, "7004840607": {"Name": "Urbach D.R.", "AuthorID": "7004840607", "AffiliationID": "60014468", "AffiliationName": "Division of General Surgery, University Health Network"}, "6508182372": {"Name": "Okrainec A.", "AuthorID": "6508182372", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto"}, "9045376800": {"Name": "Sockalingam S.", "AuthorID": "9045376800", "AffiliationID": "60014468", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Mental Health, University Health Network"}, "7103067646": {"Name": "Allard J.P.", "AuthorID": "7103067646", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Toronto"}, "55554856400": {"Name": "Paterson A.D.", "AuthorID": "55554856400", "AffiliationID": "60019991, 60014468", "AffiliationName": "Toronto General Research Institute, University Health Network"}, "57212057466": {"Name": "Yao T.", "AuthorID": "57212057466", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto"}, "6701584107": {"Name": "Barua M.", "AuthorID": "6701584107", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto"}, "57203082986": {"Name": "Dahlman I.", "AuthorID": "57203082986", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto"}, "57214545992": {"Name": "Jiao H.", "AuthorID": "57214545992", "AffiliationID": "60019991, 60014468", "AffiliationName": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Toronto General Research Institute, University Health Network"}, "56813518300": {"Name": "Magi R.", "AuthorID": "56813518300", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet"}, "24358418900": {"Name": "Bassett A.S.", "AuthorID": "24358418900", "AffiliationID": "60014468", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, University Health Network"}}}
