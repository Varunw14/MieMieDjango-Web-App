High-order differentiability and regularity estimates are established for subdiffusion equations with time-dependent coefficients. Using these regularity results and a perturbation argument of freezing the diffusion coefficient, we prove that the convolution quadrature generated by the second-order backward differentiation formula, with proper correction at the first time step, can achieve second-order convergence for both nonsmooth initial data and incompatible source term. Numerical experiments are consistent with the theoretical results.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087017221", "SubjectAreas": [["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"8268296700": {"Name": "Jin B.", "AuthorID": "8268296700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "56129851300": {"Name": "Li B.", "AuthorID": "56129851300", "AffiliationID": "60008928", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Mathematics, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"}, "55649851300": {"Name": "Zhou Z.", "AuthorID": "55649851300", "AffiliationID": "60008928", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Mathematics, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"}}}
