Methods: An economic evaluation was undertaken alongside a randomized controlled trial involving 100 patients. Outcome measures were quality of life and ESR assessed at baseline and post-intervention. Costs were calculated for healthcare usage using a United Kingdom National Health Service economic perspective. Sensitivity analysis was performed to explore the impact of nurse-led telephone helplines. Uncertainty around the cost-effectiveness ratios was estimated by bootstrapping and analysing the cost-effectiveness planes. Results: Fifty-two patients received the intervention and 48 usual care. The difference in mean cost per case indicated that the intervention was \u00a3263 more expensive (P < 0.001; 95% CI: \u00a3149.14, \u00a3375.86) when the helpline costs were accounted for and \u00a394 cheaper (P = 0.08; 95% CI: -\u00a3199.26, \u00a310.41) when these costs were absorbed by the usual service. There were, however, statistically significant savings for the patient (P = 0.02; 95% CI: -\u00a328.98, \u00a33.00). When costs and effectiveness measures of ESR and quality of life measured, using the Short Form-12v1, were combined this did not show the patient-initiated service to be cost-effective at a statistically significant level. Conclusion: This patient-initiated service led to reductions in primary and secondary healthcare services that translated into reduced costs, in comparison with usual care, but were not cost-effective. Further work is needed to establish how nurse-led telephone triage services are integrated into rheumatology services and the associated costs of setting up and delivering them.", "AuthorKeywords": ["economic evaluation", "health-services research", "psoriatic arthritis", "rheumatoid arthritis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85100295384", "SubjectAreas": [["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57200401472": {"Name": "Mcbain H.", "AuthorID": "57200401472", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Sciences, City, University of London"}, "8579935300": {"Name": "Flood C.", "AuthorID": "8579935300", "AffiliationID": "60031237", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Social Care, London South Bank University"}, "55808072084": {"Name": "Newman S.", "AuthorID": "55808072084", "AffiliationID": "60031237", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Social Care, London South Bank University"}, "7103265839": {"Name": "Shipley M.", "AuthorID": "7103265839", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, University College London Hospital"}, "56073553500": {"Name": "Olaleye A.", "AuthorID": "56073553500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, University College London Hospital"}, "55240992300": {"Name": "Moore S.", "AuthorID": "55240992300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, University College London Hospital"}}}
