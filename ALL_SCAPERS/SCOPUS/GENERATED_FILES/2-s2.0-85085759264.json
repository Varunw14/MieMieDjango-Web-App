The building blocks, or syllables, of these movements are produced by spinal cord circuits that are comprised of diverse neuronal types that control musculoskeletal systems comprised of multi-segmented limbs. Together, these systems provide mammals with the evolutionary advantages of power, speed, and endurance. Here, I propose that the key steps in chordate evolution that led to these traits began with the development of the notochord and a proliferative ventricular zone (with associated Notch signalling). This step led to the production of diverse neuronal types that included the development of a sympathetic nervous system that could regulate the evolving cardiovascular system. And the sympathetic nervous system in turn led to the development of homeothermic endothermy, a requirement for motor systems to produce a combination of power, speed, and endurance. Furthermore, the evolution of the continuous structure of the spinal cord led not only to a structure fit for cartesian signalling molecules, but also to one with high processing power in which circuits for effecting movement syllables formed. These syllables are harnessed by higher regions of nervous systems to produce the complex movements required for interactions with others and with the surrounding environment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cardiovascular evolution", "endothermy", "microcircuits", "movement", "notochord", "spinal cord", "sympathetic nervous system", "ventricular zone"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085759264", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"6701741012": {"Name": "Brownstone R.M.", "AuthorID": "6701741012", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuromuscular Disease, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}}}
