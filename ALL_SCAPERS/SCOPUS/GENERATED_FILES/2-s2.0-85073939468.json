The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of organizational structure and work autonomy on entrepreneurial tendencies, locus of control and performance. Design/methodology/approach: Data were obtained online using validated self-report questionnaires in a sample of 181 currently employed individuals. Findings: The results showed organizational structure components to be related to work autonomy and performance, but not to individual-level variables. However, work autonomy related to entrepreneurial tendencies and locus of control, indicating potential indirect effects of organizational structure on individual-level variables via work autonomy. Entrepreneurial tendencies and locus of control were positively related to performance. Originality/value: Whilst the mediating effect of a number of individual-level traits has been examined in the past, very little research has looked at how organizational factors may influence entrepreneurial tendencies. Fostering entrepreneurial tendencies in employees may facilitate corporate entrepreneurship and performance within organizations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Entrepreneurial tendencies", "Job performance", "Organizational structure", "Work autonomy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073939468", "SubjectAreas": [["Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management", "BUSI", "1407"]], "AuthorData": {"24072779200": {"Name": "Ahmetoglu G.", "AuthorID": "24072779200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "57189710405": {"Name": "Codreanu S.C.", "AuthorID": "57189710405", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "8244744300": {"Name": "Chamorro-Premuzic T.", "AuthorID": "8244744300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "57211433248": {"Name": "Scarlett L.", "AuthorID": "57211433248", "AffiliationID": "60010964", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Management Studies, Goldsmiths, University of London"}}}
