Optical switches could offer a future-proof alternative, and photonic integration platforms have been demonstrated with nanosecond-scale optical switching times. End-to-end switching time is, however, currently limited by the clock and data recovery time, which typically takes microseconds, removing the benefits of nanosecond optical switching. Here we show that a clock phase caching technique can provide clock and data recovery times of under 625 ps (16 symbols at 25.6 Gb s\u22121). Our approach uses the measurement and storage of clock phase values in a synchronized network to simplify clock and data recovery versus conventional asynchronous approaches. We demonstrate the capabilities of our technique using a real-time prototype with commercial transceivers and validate its resilience against temperature variation and clock jitter.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Caching technique", "Clock and data recovery", "Future proofs", "Optical switching", "Photonic integrations", "Sub nanoseconds", "Switching time", "Temperature variation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086780366", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57204924399": {"Name": "Clark K.A.", "AuthorID": "57204924399", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57199059707": {"Name": "Gerard T.", "AuthorID": "57199059707", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "9274397600": {"Name": "Zervas G.", "AuthorID": "9274397600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005053644": {"Name": "Bayvel P.", "AuthorID": "7005053644", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56115496300": {"Name": "Liu Z.", "AuthorID": "56115496300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57202050117": {"Name": "Cletheroe D.", "AuthorID": "57202050117", "AffiliationID": "60098463", "AffiliationName": "Microsoft Research"}, "57220386913": {"Name": "Haller I.", "AuthorID": "57220386913", "AffiliationID": "60098463", "AffiliationName": "Microsoft Research"}, "57202090493": {"Name": "Jozwik K.", "AuthorID": "57202090493", "AffiliationID": "60098463", "AffiliationName": "Microsoft Research"}, "36140432900": {"Name": "Shi K.", "AuthorID": "36140432900", "AffiliationID": "60098463", "AffiliationName": "Microsoft Research"}, "7006614570": {"Name": "Thomsen B.", "AuthorID": "7006614570", "AffiliationID": "60098463", "AffiliationName": "Microsoft Research"}, "57202094782": {"Name": "Williams H.", "AuthorID": "57202094782", "AffiliationID": "60098463", "AffiliationName": "Microsoft Research"}, "16021480000": {"Name": "Ballani H.", "AuthorID": "16021480000", "AffiliationID": "60098463", "AffiliationName": "Microsoft Research"}, "57190770908": {"Name": "Costa P.", "AuthorID": "57190770908", "AffiliationID": "60098463", "AffiliationName": "Microsoft Research"}}}
