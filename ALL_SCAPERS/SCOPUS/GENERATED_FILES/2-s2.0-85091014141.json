In cancer treatment applications, high-power ultrasound is focused at a target tissue volume to ablate the malignant tumour. The success of the procedure depends on the ability to accurately focus ultrasound and destroy the target tissue volume through coagulative necrosis whilst preserving the surrounding healthy tissue. Patient-specific treatment planning strategies are therefore being developed to increase the efficacy of such therapies, while reducing any damage to healthy tissue. These strategies require to use high-performance computing methods to solve ultrasound wave propagation in the body quickly and accurately. For realistic clinical scenarios, all numerical methods which employ volumetric meshes require several hours or days to solve the full-wave propagation on a computer cluster. The boundary element method (BEM) is an efficient approach for modelling the wave field because only the boundaries of the hard and soft tissue regions require discretisation. This paper presents a multiple-domain BEM formulation with a novel preconditioner for solving the Helmholtz transmission problem (HTP). This new formulation is efficient at high-frequencies and where high-contrast materials are present. Numerical experiments are performed to solve the HTP in multiple domains comprising: (i) human ribs, an idealised abdominal fat layer and liver tissue, (ii) a human kidney with a perinephric fat layer, exposed to the acoustic field generated by a high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) array transducer. The time required to solve the equations associated with these problems on a single workstation is of the order of minutes. These results demonstrate the great potential of this new BEM formulation for accurately and quickly solving ultrasound wave propagation problems in large anatomical domains which is essential for developing treatment planning strategies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer treatment planning", "Helmholtz transmission problem", "High intensity focused ultrasound", "Multiple-domain boundary element method", "OSRC preconditioner"], "IndexKeywords": ["High intensity focused ultrasound", "High performance computing", "High power ultrasound", "Numerical experiments", "Soft-tissue regions", "Therapeutic ultrasound", "Transmission problem", "Ultrasound propagation", "Acoustics", "Algorithms", "High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation", "Humans", "Models, Biological", "Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091014141", "SubjectAreas": [["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"]], "AuthorData": {"56502176900": {"Name": "Haqshenas S.R.", "AuthorID": "56502176900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "6505814954": {"Name": "G\u00e9lat P.", "AuthorID": "6505814954", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "6603625764": {"Name": "Saffari N.", "AuthorID": "6603625764", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "23102173100": {"Name": "Betcke T.", "AuthorID": "23102173100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "57217356916": {"Name": "van \u2019t Wout E.", "AuthorID": "57217356916", "AffiliationID": "60029681", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Mathematical and Computational Engineering, School of Engineering and Faculty of Mathematics, Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile"}}}
