We generated two induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from DMD patients with nonsense mutations in exons 68 (UCLi011-A) or 70 (UCLi012-A) by transfecting reprogramming mRNAs. Both mutations affect expression of all dystrophin isoforms. iPSCs expressed pluripotency-associated markers, differentiated into cells of the three germ layers in vitro and had normal karyotypes. The selected mutations are potentially amenable to read-through therapies, exon-skipping and gene-editing. These new iPSCs are also relevant to study DYSTROPHIN role in tissues other than skeletal muscle.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Dystrophin", "Exons", "Humans", "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne", "Mutation", "Protein Isoforms", "Transfection"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079627729", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"7201855583": {"Name": "Ferrari G.", "AuthorID": "7201855583", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "7006168683": {"Name": "Tedesco F.S.", "AuthorID": "7006168683", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7102038246": {"Name": "Muntoni F.", "AuthorID": "7102038246", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre"}}}
