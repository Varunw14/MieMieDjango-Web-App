Hybrid functionals are often reparametrized to obtain accurate results and the a priori selection of these parameters is still an open question. Here we test the accuracy of several range-separated hybrid functionals, all reparametrized to produce an accurate band gap, by calculating the charge transition levels (CTLs) of experimentally well-studied hole polaron defect centers in MgO. We show that the functional with screened long-range exact exchange is moderately but consistently more accurate than functionals which do not include long-range exact exchange. We provide evidence that the source of the improved accuracy is the eigenvalue associated with the valence band maximum of the bulk material. We discuss the extent to which this accuracy relates to Koopmans' compliance of the defect energy level.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Defect centers", "Defect energy level", "Degree of localization", "Exact exchange", "Hybrid functionals", "Transition level", "Trapping energy", "Valence-band maximums"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092158332", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"57209857476": {"Name": "Wing D.", "AuthorID": "57209857476", "AffiliationID": "60017563", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials and Interfaces, Weizmann Institute of Science"}, "57203255888": {"Name": "Kronik L.", "AuthorID": "57203255888", "AffiliationID": "60017563", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials and Interfaces, Weizmann Institute of Science"}, "57189627614": {"Name": "Strand J.", "AuthorID": "57189627614", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56442450000": {"Name": "Durrant T.", "AuthorID": "56442450000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7007118546": {"Name": "Shluger A.L.", "AuthorID": "7007118546", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
