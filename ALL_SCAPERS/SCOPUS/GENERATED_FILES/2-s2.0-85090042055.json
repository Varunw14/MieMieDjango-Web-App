Non-destructive material surveys delivered paper pH and degree of polymerisation data that, in conjunction with the Collections Demography dose\u2013response function, provide heritage managers with estimations of the predicted collection lifetimes in diverse environmental management scenarios. For the first time, quantitative measurements of paper properties obtained in a historical library collection were used to elaborate isochrone and demographic plots, evaluated against the long-term planning horizon of 500 years. The scenarios include preventive and interventive actions aiming to preserve the fitness-for-use of collection items in terms of their ability to withstand manual handling, and consider cooling, dehumidification and deacidification, as well as combinations thereof. The results inform the conservation decision-makers about the preservation outcomes of environmental management options, to be considered for further action, once environmental, economic and social sustainability of such scenarios is considered.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Classense library", "Demography of collections", "Isochrones", "Non-destructive survey", "Paper-based collections", "Preventive conservation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090042055", "SubjectAreas": [["Conservation", "ARTS", "1206"], ["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"56698023800": {"Name": "Coppola F.", "AuthorID": "56698023800", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry \u201cG.
