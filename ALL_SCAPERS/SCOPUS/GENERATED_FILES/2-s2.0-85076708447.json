Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Following numerous global scientific studies and major international agreements, thedecarbonization of energy systems is an apparent and pressing concern. The consequence ofcontinued emission growth tied to rising global average temperatures is difficult to predict, butagainst a background of other natural and human-induced disasters, may create a situation, from apositive perspective, where each disaster event triggers \"build back better\" responses designed tospeed the transition toward low carbon, resilience-oriented energy systems. This article examinesthe potential for disaster-triggered responses in communities, at various local and regional levels, infour industrial economies in the Asia Pacific region: Japan, China, Australia, and the USA. Sevencase studies were evaluated against a set of criteria that exemplify the key aspects of resilient energysystems. The research results suggest that a new space of innovation does emerge in post-disastersituations at a range of local and regional scales. The greatest potential benefit and opportunityfor significant gains, however, appears to manifest at the small community level, and the ultimatechallenge relates to how to mainstream local innovations into state and national level transformationon energy systems so as to enhance resilience and promote rapid decarbonization.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Climate change", "Community", "Decarbonization", "Disasters", "Energy", "Innovations", "Local; sub-national", "Pathways", "Resilience", "Transitions", "Triggers"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076708447", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"55868766900": {"Name": "Ko Y.", "AuthorID": "55868766900", "AffiliationID": "60012317", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture and Environment, University of Oregon"}, "7101964615": {"Name": "Barrett B.F.D.", "AuthorID": "7101964615", "AffiliationID": "60024322", "AffiliationName": "Center for the Study of Co Design, Osaka University"}, "6603885380": {"Name": "Copping A.E.", "AuthorID": "6603885380", "AffiliationID": "60023471, 60015481", "AffiliationName": "Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and University ofWashington"}, "55203967900": {"Name": "Sharifi A.", "AuthorID": "55203967900", "AffiliationID": "60030788", "AffiliationName": "Network for Education and Research on Peace and Sustainability (NERPS), Hiroshima University"}, "23037745200": {"Name": "Yarime M.", "AuthorID": "23037745200", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Public Policy, The University of Tokyo"}, "57192627557": {"Name": "Wang X.", "AuthorID": "57192627557", "AffiliationID": "60073652", "AffiliationName": "College of Architecture and Urban Planning, Tongji University"}}}
