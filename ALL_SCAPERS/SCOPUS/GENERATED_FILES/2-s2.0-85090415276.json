Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are emerging as promising tools for the crusade against AD owning to appropriate biocompatibility and facile functionalization that can lead to theranostic agents. Herein, the fabrication of a multimodal (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fluorescence imaging, and drug carrier) magnetic nanoemulsion (MNE) is reported as an AD theranostic candidate. Initially zinc ferrite MNPs of high saturation magnetization (129 emu g-1) were synthesized through a modified microwave-assisted polyol process. Memantine (a registered AD drug) was labeled with fluorescein (Mem-Flu) and encapsulated with the MNPs in sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles to form the MNE. Small hydrodynamic size (107), high encapsulation (77.5%) and loading efficiencies (86.1%) and sufficient transverse relaxivity (48.7 mM-1 s-1) were achieved through the design while sustained release of Mem-Flu was unveiled by in zero-order, first-order, Higuchi and Korsmeyer-Peppas pharmacokinetic models. Moreover, the MNE acquired fluorescence imaging ability of A\u03b21-42 peptide monomers and/or plaques-fibrils via the fluorescein labeling of Memantine. A novel inorganic-organic hybrid multimodal AD theranostic candidate is presented.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amyloid-beta", "Magnetic nanoparticles", "Memantine", "Polyol process", "Sodium dodecyl sulfate", "Zinc ferrite"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "High-saturation magnetization", "Inorganic-organic hybrid", "Magnetic nanoemulsion", "Magnetic nanoparti cles (MNPs)", "Microwave-assisted polyol process", "Pharmacokinetic model", "Sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090415276", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57195923042": {"Name": "Antonoglou O.", "AuthorID": "57195923042", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Inorganic Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "55903000400": {"Name": "Giannousi K.", "AuthorID": "55903000400", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Inorganic Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "6602808703": {"Name": "Dendrinou-Samara C.", "AuthorID": "6602808703", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Inorganic Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "16507083500": {"Name": "Mourdikoudis S.", "AuthorID": "16507083500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Ucl Healthcare Biomagnetic and Nanomaterials Laboratories"}}}
