However, the IIEF was initially developed using a sample of men whose sexual orientation was unspecified. Using scales not validated for specific populations can result in inaccurate assessments. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the dimensionality, reliability, and validity of the IIEF with a large sample of gay men. One thousand and eighteen men self-identifying as \u201cexclusively gay\u201d completed an online survey consisting of demographics, the IIEF, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Perceived Stress Scale 4 (PSS4), and the Gay Male Sexual Difficulties (GMSD) erectile difficulties sub-scale. The replicability of the IIEF factor structure with a gay male sample was determined using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Additionally, the HADS, PSS4, and GMSD were used to determine the validity of the IIEF. The current study was unable to replicate the IIEF factor structure. Four items required deletion and the factor solution differed from the original. Thus, reinterpretation of the latent variables was deemed necessary. Although the resultant 12-item IIEF evidenced model fit, validity, and reliability, it is not recommended for use with gay men. The revised IIEF is unable to accurately measure gay men\u2019s erectile functioning as the content of the items fail to capture their sexual behaviors (i.e., insertive and receptive anal sex).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092448770", "SubjectAreas": [["Gender Studies", "SOCI", "3318"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["History and Philosophy of Science", "ARTS", "1207"]], "AuthorData": {"55938731000": {"Name": "Kiss M.J.", "AuthorID": "55938731000", "AffiliationID": "60015186", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Saskatchewan"}, "57213044889": {"Name": "Sparks B.", "AuthorID": "57213044889", "AffiliationID": "60015186", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Saskatchewan"}, "57207347521": {"Name": "Hamp T.", "AuthorID": "57207347521", "AffiliationID": "60015186", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Saskatchewan"}, "7101728079": {"Name": "Morrison T.G.", "AuthorID": "7101728079", "AffiliationID": "60015186", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Saskatchewan"}, "55996347300": {"Name": "McDonagh L.K.", "AuthorID": "55996347300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}}}
