The modification can be applied to other expression vectors for Gram-negative bacteria. We have used the modified vectors to clone large numbers of bacterial natural enzyme variants from genomic and metagenomic sources for applications in biocatalysis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Expression in E. coli", "Golden Gate", "PET vectors", "SacB", "Seamless cloning"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096203250", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"57193662275": {"Name": "Dobrijevic D.", "AuthorID": "57193662275", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "55547113393": {"Name": "Ward J.M.", "AuthorID": "55547113393", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57219944002": {"Name": "Nematollahi L.A.", "AuthorID": "57219944002", "AffiliationID": "60159419", "AffiliationName": "Synthace Ltd, The Westworks"}, "6603904305": {"Name": "Hailes H.C.", "AuthorID": "6603904305", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
