The electrochemical study results showed that with the nominal composition of Ni1.5Co1.5S4, the cobalt nickel sulfide powder possesses an OER activity on a par with that of RuO2, while displaying superior cycling stability (>125 cycles) and a decent power density of 87 mW cm-2 at 150 mA cm-2 in zinc-air batteries. The electrochemical study of the series of cobalt nickel sulfides made herein suggests that a high electronic conductivity is responsible for the high bifunctional performance, with Ni(iii) being identified as a contributor to the OER, while Co(ii) and Ni(ii) are identified as contributors to the ORR activity. These cathode materials would be highly suitable for safe, sustainable, and long-life zinc-air secondary batteries.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Compositional tuning", "Continuous hydrothermal flow synthesis", "Electrochemical studies", "Electronic conductivity", "Nanosized spinels", "Nominal composition", "Oxygen evolution reaction (oer)", "Rechargeable zinc-air batteries"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083224911", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"]], "AuthorData": {"57201802769": {"Name": "Xu Y.", "AuthorID": "57201802769", "AffiliationID": "60030743, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE), ASTAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research)"}, "6603926697": {"Name": "Darr J.A.", "AuthorID": "6603926697", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "8938607100": {"Name": "Zong Y.", "AuthorID": "8938607100", "AffiliationID": "60030743, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE), ASTAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research)"}, "36005012700": {"Name": "Sumboja A.", "AuthorID": "36005012700", "AffiliationID": "120518561", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Sustainable Transportation Technology (NCSTT)"}}}
