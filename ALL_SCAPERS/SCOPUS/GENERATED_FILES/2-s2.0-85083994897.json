Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and ischemic heart disease are among the leading causes of death and disability inWestern countries. Diabetic cardiomyopathy is responsible for the most severe signs and symptoms. An important strategy for reducing the incidence of cardiovascular disease is regular exercise. Remote ischemic conditioning has some similarity with exercise and can be induced by short periods of ischemia and reperfusion of a limb, and it can be performed in people who cannot exercise. There is abundant evidence that exercise is beneficial in diabetes and ischemic heart disease, but there is a need to elucidate the specific cardiovascular effects of emerging and unconventional forms of exercise in people with diabetes. In addition, remote ischemic conditioning may be considered among the options to induce beneficial effects in these patients. The characteristics and interactions of diabetes and ischemic heart disease, and the known effects of exercise and remote ischemic conditioning in the presence of metabolic syndrome and diabetes, are analyzed in this brief review.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diabetic cardiomyopathy", "Exercise", "Hyperglycemia", "Ischemia/reperfusion injury", "Metabolism", "Mitochondria", "Remote conditioning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Diabetes Mellitus", "Diabetic Cardiomyopathies", "Disease Management", "Disease Susceptibility", "Exercise", "Humans", "Ischemic Preconditioning", "Metabolic Networks and Pathways", "Myocardial Ischemia", "Myocardial Reperfusion Injury"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083994897", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"7003981823": {"Name": "Crisafulli A.", "AuthorID": "7003981823", "AffiliationID": "60072429", "AffiliationName": "1Cardiovascular Research Center, College of Medical and Health Sciences, Asia University"}, "55338301000": {"Name": "Roberto S.", "AuthorID": "55338301000", "AffiliationID": "60072429", "AffiliationName": "1Cardiovascular Research Center, College of Medical and Health Sciences, Asia University"}, "7006242881": {"Name": "Mercuro G.", "AuthorID": "7006242881", "AffiliationID": "60072429", "AffiliationName": "1Cardiovascular Research Center, College of Medical and Health Sciences, Asia University"}, "7005683618": {"Name": "Pagliaro P.", "AuthorID": "7005683618", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Biological Science, University of Torino"}, "7006606447": {"Name": "Aragno M.", "AuthorID": "7006606447", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Biological Science, University of Torino"}, "7006374216": {"Name": "Penna C.", "AuthorID": "7006374216", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Biological Science, University of Torino"}, "54880805700": {"Name": "Cugusi L.", "AuthorID": "54880805700", "AffiliationID": "60010110", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sassari"}, "7003955293": {"Name": "Lazou A.", "AuthorID": "7003955293", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "School of Biology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "6506794954": {"Name": "Beauloye C.", "AuthorID": "6506794954", "AffiliationID": "60012936", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiology, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc"}, "7102449627": {"Name": "Bertrand L.", "AuthorID": "7102449627", "AffiliationID": "60000874", "AffiliationName": "Pole of Cardiovascular Research, IREC Institute, UCLouvain"}, "6602976997": {"Name": "Hausenloy D.J.", "AuthorID": "6602976997", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, University College London"}}}
