However, delivery of these agents remains restricted to intra-tumoral administration, which prevents effective targeting of inaccessible and disseminated tumor cells. In the present study we have identified transient pharmacological inhibition of the leukocyte-enriched phosphoinositide 3-kinase \u03b4 (PI3K\u03b4) as a novel mechanism to potentiate intravenous delivery of oncolytic VV to tumors. Pre-treatment of immunocompetent mice with the PI3K\u03b4-selective inhibitor IC87114 or the clinically approved idelalisib (CAL-101), prior to intravenous delivery of a tumor-tropic VV, dramatically improved viral delivery to tumors. This occurred via an inhibition of viral attachment to, but not internalization by, systemic macrophages through perturbation of signaling pathways involving RhoA/ROCK, AKT, and Rac. Pre-treatment using PI3K\u03b4-selective inhibitors prior to intravenous delivery of VV resulted in enhanced anti-tumor efficacy and significantly prolonged survival compared to delivery without PI3K\u03b4 inhibition. These results indicate that effective intravenous delivery of oncolytic VV may be clinically achievable and could be useful in improving anti-tumor efficacy of oncolytic virotherapy.\u00a9 2020 The AuthorsTransient pharmacological inhibition of the PI3 kinase \u03b4 isoform using CAL-101 allows for improved vaccinia virus accumulation in tumor tissues after intravenous delivery by preventing macrophage uptake of the virus. This platform allows for effective anti-tumor activity after systemic administration of oncolytic vaccinia virus.", "AuthorKeywords": ["breast cancer", "colorectal cancer", "immunotherapy", "intravenous delivery", "macrophage", "oncolytic virus", "phosphoinositide 3-kinase \u03b4", "vaccinia virus"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081283478", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"55595505500": {"Name": "Ferguson M.S.", "AuthorID": "55595505500", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57215577402": {"Name": "Chard Dunmall L.S.", "AuthorID": "57215577402", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "6508037623": {"Name": "Gangeswaran R.", "AuthorID": "6508037623", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57052805700": {"Name": "Marelli G.", "AuthorID": "57052805700", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "13905463600": {"Name": "Tysome J.R.", "AuthorID": "13905463600", "AffiliationID": "60016390", "AffiliationName": "Otolaryngology Department, Cambridge University Hospitals"}, "26023290600": {"Name": "Hiley C.", "AuthorID": "26023290600", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57215573680": {"Name": "Ahmed J.", "AuthorID": "57215573680", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7102718728": {"Name": "Lemoine N.R.", "AuthorID": "7102718728", "AffiliationID": "60018554", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for International Research in Cell and Gene Therapy, Sino-British Research Centre for Molecular Oncology, Academy of Medical Sciences, Zhengzhou University"}, "12042351800": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "12042351800", "AffiliationID": "60018554", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for International Research in Cell and Gene Therapy, Sino-British Research Centre for Molecular Oncology, Academy of Medical Sciences, Zhengzhou University"}, "36922595200": {"Name": "Burns E.", "AuthorID": "36922595200", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cell Signalling, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "55196070400": {"Name": "Whitehead M.A.", "AuthorID": "55196070400", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute"}, "7004331309": {"Name": "Vanhaesebroeck B.", "AuthorID": "7004331309", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute"}, "6701447168": {"Name": "Aksoy E.", "AuthorID": "6701447168", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "55957178200": {"Name": "Alusi G.", "AuthorID": "55957178200", "AffiliationID": "60010088, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Otolaryngology, Head & Neck Surgery, Barts Health NHS Trust, The Royal London Hospital"}}}
