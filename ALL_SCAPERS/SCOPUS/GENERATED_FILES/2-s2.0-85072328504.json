In this study, copper and nickel co-coated cotton textile was developed as the substrate, on which tremella-like Ni\u2013Co\u2013S nanoflakes were electrochemically deposited. The obtained electrode exhibits high specific capacity with good rate capability, flexibility and bendability. An asymmetric supercapacitor cell containing Ni\u2013Co\u2013S as cathode, active carbon as anode and PVA/KOH as the solid-state electrolyte, demonstrate superior electrochemical properties for wearable energy storage applications. The obtained supercapacitor cell delivers a high energy density of 48.9 Wh kg\u22121 at 390 W kg\u22121. When four cells were connected in series, the connected cells can be safely operated at a wide voltage window of 0.0\u20136.4 V due to the good electrochemical stability and consistency of the assembled cells. These results demonstrated the flexible textile electrode developed by this work hold great potential for practical application in wearable energy storage devices.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cotton textile", "Flexible electrode", "Ni-Co-S", "Supercapacitor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Asymmetric supercapacitor", "Cotton textiles", "Electrochemical stabilities", "Energy storage applications", "Flexible electrodes", "High energy densities", "High specific capacity", "Solid-state electrolyte"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072328504", "SubjectAreas": [["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57200620419": {"Name": "Wang Z.", "AuthorID": "57200620419", "AffiliationID": "60019496", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory Base for Eco-Chemical Engineering, College of Chemical Engineering, Qingdao University of Science and Technology"}, "57211029694": {"Name": "Wang H.", "AuthorID": "57211029694", "AffiliationID": "60019496", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory Base for Eco-Chemical Engineering, College of Chemical Engineering, Qingdao University of Science and Technology"}, "12802385800": {"Name": "Ji S.", "AuthorID": "12802385800", "AffiliationID": "60073560", "AffiliationName": "College of Biological, Chemical Science and Chemical Engineering, Jiaxing University"}, "54415016600": {"Name": "Wang H.", "AuthorID": "54415016600", "AffiliationID": "60019496", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory Base for Eco-Chemical Engineering, College of Chemical Engineering, Qingdao University of Science and Technology"}, "26436412000": {"Name": "Wang R.", "AuthorID": "26436412000", "AffiliationID": "60019496", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory Base for Eco-Chemical Engineering, College of Chemical Engineering, Qingdao University of Science and Technology"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.J.L.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Dept.
