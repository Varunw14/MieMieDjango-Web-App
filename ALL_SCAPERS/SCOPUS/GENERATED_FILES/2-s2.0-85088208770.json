Intracranial volume measurements are routinely derived from computed tomography (CT) head scans, which involves ionizing radiation. Estimation of ICV from head surface volumes could prove useful as 3D surface scanners could be used to indirectly acquire ICV information, using a non-invasive, non-ionizing method.Pre- and postoperative 3D CT scans from spring-assisted posterior vault expansion (sPVE) patients operated between 2008 and 2018 in a single center were collected. Patients were treated for multisutural craniosynostosis, both syndromic and non-syndromic. For each patient, ICV was calculated from the CT scans as carried out in clinical practice. Additionally, the 3D soft tissue surface volume (STV) was extracted by 3D reconstruction of the CT image soft tissue of each case, further elaborated by computer-aided design (CAD) software. Correlations were analyzed before surgery, after surgery, combined for all patients and in syndrome subgroups.Soft tissue surface volume was highly correlated to ICV for all analyses: r = 0.946 preoperatively, r = 0.959 postoperatively, and r = 0.960 all cases combined. Subgroup analyses for Apert, Crouzon-Pfeiffer and complex craniosynostosis were highly significant as well (P < 0.001).In conclusion, 3D surface model volumes correlated strongly to ICV, measured from the same scan, and linear equations for this correlation are provided. Estimation of ICV with just a 3D surface model could thus be realized using a simple method, which does not require radiations and therefore would allow closer monitoring in patients through multiple acquisitions over time.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Child, Preschool", "Craniosynostoses", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Postoperative Period", "Software", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088208770", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"]], "AuthorData": {"57218192080": {"Name": "Ramdat Misier K.R.R.", "AuthorID": "57218192080", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Erasmus University Medical Center"}, "55951479500": {"Name": "Caron C.J.J.M.", "AuthorID": "55951479500", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Erasmus University Medical Center"}, "6603112761": {"Name": "Koudstaal M.J.", "AuthorID": "6603112761", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Department of Craniofacial Malformations, Karolinska University Hospital"}, "57044636000": {"Name": "Breakey R.W.F.", "AuthorID": "57044636000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Craniofacial Unit"}, "13410386200": {"Name": "Schievano S.", "AuthorID": "13410386200", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Craniofacial Unit"}, "7003742514": {"Name": "Dunaway D.J.", "AuthorID": "7003742514", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Craniofacial Unit"}, "54990206100": {"Name": "Jeelani O.N.U.", "AuthorID": "54990206100", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Craniofacial Unit"}, "23396002400": {"Name": "Borghi A.", "AuthorID": "23396002400", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Craniofacial Unit"}}}
