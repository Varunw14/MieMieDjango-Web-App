This data brief presents relevant national and sub-national data on patterns, trends, and impacts of reported urban infrastructure-related displacements in Nigeria between 2010 and 2016. The data of reported cases of displacements in Nigeria are presented in tabular matrix. On the horizontal side are nested rows designated as the six geopolitical zones (South East, South South, South West, North Central, North East, and North West), 36 States of the country, and Abuja Federal Capital Territory. It was also necessary to identify particular local government areas where displacements occurred or were imminent (case locations). On the vertical side, 14 columns itemized diverse variables such as type of infrastructure project, as well as the mode/type, status, and mechanisms of displacement. Other columns include reasons given for displacement, project funder/initiator, number of project affected persons (PAPs), reported social characteristics of PAPs, response of PAPs, actions/outcomes, information sources and link, date(s) of reported displacement in addition to a section for notes. Besides chronicling urban infrastructure-related displacement cases in the period under review, this brief might equally serve as a benchmark for a prospective national displacement register. It will also function as a useful information resource not only for facilitating advocacy and research in built environment disciplines and civil rights campaigns, but also serve to conscientize policy makers and development practitioners on the cumulative cost implications of displacement. Further interpretive insights could be achieved through data mining and cross-tabulation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Development-related displacements", "Evictions", "Nigerian cities", "Project affected persons (PAPs)", "Public interest"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092339603", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"15748441800": {"Name": "Onyebueke V.", "AuthorID": "15748441800", "AffiliationID": "60025390", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urban & Regional Planning, University of Nigeria, Enugu Campus"}, "57212309843": {"Name": "Ujah O.", "AuthorID": "57212309843", "AffiliationID": "119428044", "AffiliationName": "African Heritage Institution"}, "23985320300": {"Name": "Lipietz B.", "AuthorID": "23985320300", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett Development Planning Unit, University College"}, "55604589000": {"Name": "Walker J.", "AuthorID": "55604589000", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett Development Planning Unit, University College"}, "57205489716": {"Name": "Ibezim-Ohaeri V.", "AuthorID": "57205489716", "AffiliationID": "124174149", "AffiliationName": "Space for Change (S4C)"}}}
