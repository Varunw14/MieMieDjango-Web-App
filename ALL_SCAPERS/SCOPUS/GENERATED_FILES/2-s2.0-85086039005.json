On the one hand, the concept is ubiquitous in management research and acts as the glue binding together the central issues of organizational change, performance, and survival. On the other hand, it lurks around in various guises (e.g., \u201cfit,\u201d \u201calignment,\u201d \u201ccongruence,\u201d and \u201cstrategic change\u201d) studied from multiple theoretical streams (e.g., behavioral, resource based, and institutional) and at different levels of analysis (e.g., organization and industry levels). In a novel approach to reviewing 443 adaptation articles that leverages both computational and hand-coded analysis, we produce an interactive visual of the themes most studied by adaptation scholars. We inductively draw out a definition of adaptation as intentional decision making undertaken by organizational members, leading to observable actions that aim to reduce the distance between an organization and its economic and institutional environments. We then review the literature across three main areas of inquiry and six theoretical perspectives that surfaced from our analysis and identify 11 difficulties that have hampered adaptation research in the past 50 years. Our review suggests ways to address these difficulties to enable future research to develop and cumulate.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adaptation", "congruence", "evolution", "fit", "performance", "strategic change", "topic modeling"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086039005", "SubjectAreas": [["Finance", "ECON", "2003"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"]], "AuthorData": {"57217070906": {"Name": "Sarta A.", "AuthorID": "57217070906", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "Western University"}, "7102891861": {"Name": "Durand R.", "AuthorID": "7102891861", "AffiliationID": "60068566", "AffiliationName": "HEC Paris"}, "36020814100": {"Name": "Vergne J.P.", "AuthorID": "36020814100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
