In all cases we find 0.58 \u03bcm grains of amorphous carbon to fit the Tuc observations the best, however, also nanometre or micrometre grains and other carbons or silicates reproduce the observations well. Since the H band data revealed a temporal variability, while our L band data were taken at a different epoch, we combine them in different ways. Depending on the approach, the best fits are obtained for a narrow dust ring at a stellar distance in the 0.1-029 au range and thus with a temperature between 940 and 1430 K. Within the 1 uncertainty dust location and temperature are confined to 0.032-1.18 au and 600-2000 K.", "AuthorKeywords": ["infrared: planetary systems", "Techniques: interferometric", "zodiacal dust"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096901378", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"55633098300": {"Name": "Kirchschlager F.", "AuthorID": "55633098300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "36237973100": {"Name": "Ertel S.", "AuthorID": "36237973100", "AffiliationID": "60010065", "AffiliationName": "Steward Observatory, Department of Astronomy, University of Arizona"}, "57203438570": {"Name": "Wolf S.", "AuthorID": "57203438570", "AffiliationID": "60012345", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Theoretical Physics and Astrophysics, Kiel University"}, "14630745200": {"Name": "Matter A.", "AuthorID": "14630745200", "AffiliationID": "60010513, 60110693, 60008134, 60110744", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire Lagrange Observatoire de la C\u00f4te d'Azur, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 C\u00f4te d'Azur"}, "7003545288": {"Name": "Krivov A.V.", "AuthorID": "7003545288", "AffiliationID": "60029507", "AffiliationName": "Astrophysical Institute, University Observatory, Friedrich Schiller University Jena"}}}
