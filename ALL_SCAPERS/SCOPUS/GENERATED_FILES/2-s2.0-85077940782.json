This method employed in situ scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and microfocused X-ray photoemission spectroscopy. An STM tip-shadowing method was used to synthesize patterned areas of Au nanoparticles on the substrate with different coverages and sizes. Patterns were identified and imaged using a UV photoelectron emission microscope. The Au 4f core level binding energies of the nanoparticles were investigated as a function of Au nanoparticle coverage and size. A combination of initial and final state effects modifies the binding energies of the Au 4f core levels as the nanoparticle size changes. When single Au atoms and Au3 clusters are present, the Au 4f7/2 binding energy, 84.42 eV, is similar to that observed at a high coverage (1.8 monolayer equivalent), resulting from a cancellation of initial and final state effects. As the coverage is increased, there is a decrease in binding energy, which then increases at a higher coverage to 84.39 eV. These results are consistent with a Volmer-Weber nucleation-growth model of Au nanoparticles at oxygen vacancies, resulting in electron transfer to the nanoparticles.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Electron transfer", "Final-state effects", "In-situ scanning tunneling microscopies", "Monolayer equivalents", "Nanoparticle sizes", "Nucleation growth model", "Photoelectron emission microscopes", "X ray photoemission spectroscopy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077940782", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57196323155": {"Name": "Mellor A.", "AuthorID": "57196323155", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "7201425162": {"Name": "Pang C.L.", "AuthorID": "7201425162", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "35423002700": {"Name": "Yim C.M.", "AuthorID": "35423002700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "7006768868": {"Name": "Idriss H.", "AuthorID": "7006768868", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "SABIC-CRI, KAUST"}, "57196232691": {"Name": "Thornton G.", "AuthorID": "57196232691", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "55869839900": {"Name": "Wilson A.", "AuthorID": "55869839900", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "14030458200": {"Name": "Maccherozzi F.", "AuthorID": "14030458200", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "7004629851": {"Name": "Dhesi S.S.", "AuthorID": "7004629851", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "7003387644": {"Name": "Muryn C.A.", "AuthorID": "7003387644", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Photon Science Institute, University of Manchester"}}}
