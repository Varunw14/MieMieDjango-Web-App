However, a systematic accounting framework for the carbon emissions of power transmission infrastructure has not yet been established. This study for the first time compiles an embodied carbon emissions inventory covering 191 typical power transmission infrastructure projects in China in 2015, including 145 types of alternating current (AC) transmission line projects, 37 typical AC substation projects, 8 typical direct current (DC) transmission line projects and 1 typical DC converter station project. The inventory also shows the detailed inputs of all the projects. These data not only enable a quantitative assessment of the embodied carbon emissions of power transmission infrastructure in China but also provide essential information for climate mitigation policy design in the power sector.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091752556", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"], ["Library and Information Sciences", "SOCI", "3309"]], "AuthorData": {"57191891533": {"Name": "Wei W.", "AuthorID": "57191891533", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "School of International and Public Affairs, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "57212410160": {"Name": "Wang M.", "AuthorID": "57212410160", "AffiliationID": "60008691", "AffiliationName": "Business School, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology"}, "57212551742": {"Name": "Zhang P.", "AuthorID": "57212551742", "AffiliationID": "60108071", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Blue and Green Development, Shandong University"}, "55720862200": {"Name": "Li J.", "AuthorID": "55720862200", "AffiliationID": "60108071", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Blue and Green Development, Shandong University"}, "57216465558": {"Name": "Chen B.", "AuthorID": "57216465558", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "College of Engineering, Peking University"}, "15839411900": {"Name": "Guan D.", "AuthorID": "15839411900", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth System Sciences, Tsinghua University"}, "35070391800": {"Name": "Shao S.", "AuthorID": "35070391800", "AffiliationID": "60011069", "AffiliationName": "School of Business, East China University of Science and Technology"}}}
