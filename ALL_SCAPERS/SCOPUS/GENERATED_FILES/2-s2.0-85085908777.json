The code implements two types of well established QMC algorithms: Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) and diffusion Monte Carlo in its robust and efficient lattice regularized variant. A key feature of the code is the possibility of using strongly correlated many-body wave functions (WFs), capable of describing several materials with very high accuracy, even when standard mean-field approaches [e.g., density functional theory (DFT)] fail. The electronic WF is obtained by applying a Jastrow factor, which takes into account dynamical correlations, to the most general mean-field ground state, written either as an antisymmetrized geminal power with spin-singlet pairing or as a Pfaffian, including both singlet and triplet correlations. This WF can be viewed as an efficient implementation of the so-called resonating valence bond (RVB) Ansatz, first proposed by Pauling and Anderson in quantum chemistry [L. Pauling, The Nature of the Chemical Bond (Cornell University Press, 1960)] and condensed matter physics [P.W. Anderson, Mat. Res. Bull 8, 153 (1973)], respectively. The RVB Ansatz implemented in TurboRVB has a large variational freedom, including the Jastrow correlated Slater determinant as its simplest, but nontrivial case. Moreover, it has the remarkable advantage of remaining with an affordable computational cost, proportional to the one spent for the evaluation of a single Slater determinant. Therefore, its application to large systems is computationally feasible. The WF is expanded in a localized basis set. Several basis set functions are implemented, such as Gaussian, Slater, and mixed types, with no restriction on the choice of their contraction. The code implements the adjoint algorithmic differentiation that enables a very efficient evaluation of energy derivatives, comprising the ionic forces. Thus, one can perform structural optimizations and molecular dynamics in the canonical NVT ensemble at the VMC level. For the electronic part, a full WF optimization (Jastrow and antisymmetric parts together) is made possible, thanks to state-of-the-art stochastic algorithms for energy minimization. In the optimization procedure, the first guess can be obtained at the mean-field level by a built-in DFT driver. The code has been efficiently parallelized by using a hybrid MPI-OpenMP protocol, which is also an ideal environment for exploiting the computational power of modern Graphics Processing Unit accelerators.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithmic differentiations", "Dynamical correlations", "Efficient implementation", "Many body wave functions", "Optimization procedures", "Quantum Monte Carlo simulations", "Resonating valence bonds", "Variational Monte Carlo"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085908777", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"55378202900": {"Name": "Nakano K.", "AuthorID": "55378202900", "AffiliationID": "60011375", "AffiliationName": "Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST)"}, "57207031561": {"Name": "Genovese C.", "AuthorID": "57207031561", "AffiliationID": "60012227", "AffiliationName": "International School for Advanced Studies (SISSA)"}, "35567243200": {"Name": "Sorella S.", "AuthorID": "35567243200", "AffiliationID": "60012227", "AffiliationName": "International School for Advanced Studies (SISSA)"}, "24758091300": {"Name": "Attaccalite C.", "AuthorID": "24758091300", "AffiliationID": "60029989, 60008134, 60102127", "AffiliationName": "Aix-Marseille Universit\u00e9, CNRS, CINaM UMR 7325, Campus de Luminy"}, "55180672400": {"Name": "Barborini M.", "AuthorID": "55180672400", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "CNR-NANO"}, "57192301108": {"Name": "Capriotti L.", "AuthorID": "57192301108", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "15750157500": {"Name": "Casula M.", "AuthorID": "15750157500", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60028993, 60028311, 60157961", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Min\u00e9ralogie de Physique des Mat\u00e9riaux et de Cosmochimie (IMPMC), Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, CNRS UMR 7590, IRD UMR 206, MNHN"}, "24480759400": {"Name": "Coccia E.", "AuthorID": "24480759400", "AffiliationID": "60018363", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Trieste"}, "55507392400": {"Name": "Dagrada M.", "AuthorID": "55507392400", "AffiliationID": "122577339", "AffiliationName": "Forescout Technologies"}, "55880003700": {"Name": "Luo Y.", "AuthorID": "55880003700", "AffiliationID": "60028609", "AffiliationName": "Argonne Leadership Computing Facility, Argonne National Laboratory"}, "37861949100": {"Name": "Mazzola G.", "AuthorID": "37861949100", "AffiliationID": "60029158", "AffiliationName": "IBM Research Zurich"}, "24172289000": {"Name": "Zen A.", "AuthorID": "24172289000", "AffiliationID": "60175883, 60175885", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Young Centre and London Centre for Nanotechnology"}}}
