This paper focuses on the generation of synthetic data with an emphasis on correlation structure. We introduce a new methodology to generate such correlated synthetic data. It is implemented in the field of socio-spatial systems, more precisely by coupling an urban growth model with a transportation network generation model. We also show the genericity of the method with an application on financial time-series. The simulation results show that the generation of correlated synthetic data for such systems is indeed feasible within a broad range of correlations, and suggest applications of such synthetic datasets.[Figure not available: see fulltext.].", "AuthorKeywords": ["Correlations", "Financial time-series", "Land-use transportation interactions", "Statistical control", "Synthetic data"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075481851", "SubjectAreas": [["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"57193993383": {"Name": "Raimbault J.", "AuthorID": "57193993383", "AffiliationID": "60123629", "AffiliationName": "UMR CNRS 8504 G\u00e9ographie-cit\u00e9s"}}}
