It is important, therefore, to understand which ecosystem services are demanded by stakeholders and whether there are trade-offs or synergies in this demand. We performed a quantitative survey of ecosystem service demand from brownfield sites that included all major stakeholder groups. Results showed that there was a strong trade-off between demand for services related to property development (e.g. ground strength and low flood risk) and all other services, which were linked to vegetated sites. There was a secondary, but weak, trade-off between demand for services of more \u2018natural\u2019 vegetated sites (e.g. with a biodiversity protection role) and those linked to aesthetics and recreation. Stakeholders with a strong preference for biodiversity protection formed a distinct group in their ecosystem service demands. While a \u2018development\u2019 vs \u2018green space\u2019 trade-off may be unavoidable, the general lack of strong trade-offs in demand for other services indicated that the creation of multifunctional greenspaces from former brownfield sites would be desirable to most stakeholders, as long as these are biophysically possible.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brownfield sites", "Demand", "Ecosystem services", "Social survey", "Stakeholders", "Trade-offs and synergies"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078972460", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous)", "AGRI", "1101"], ["Nature and Landscape Conservation", "ENVI", "2309"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"48462198800": {"Name": "Washbourne C.", "AuthorID": "48462198800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Science, Technology, Engineering and Public Policy, University College London"}, "56030710400": {"Name": "Goddard M.", "AuthorID": "56030710400", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography and Environmental Sciences, Northumbria University"}, "57211405979": {"Name": "Le Provost G.", "AuthorID": "57211405979", "AffiliationID": "60116084", "AffiliationName": "Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre (SBIK-F)"}, "57210751721": {"Name": "Manning P.", "AuthorID": "57210751721", "AffiliationID": "60116084", "AffiliationName": "Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre (SBIK-F)"}, "7201460937": {"Name": "Manning D.", "AuthorID": "7201460937", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "School of Natural and Environmental Sciences, Newcastle University"}}}
