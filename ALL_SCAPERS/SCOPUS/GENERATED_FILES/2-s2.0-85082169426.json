All rights reserved.This paper introduces an interface that enables the user to quickly identify relevant fragments within multiple long documents. The proposed method relies on a machine-generated layer of annotations that reveals the coverage of topics per fragment and document. To illustrate howthe annotations double as a tool for previewaswell as navigation, an example application is presented in the form of a personalised learning system that recommends relevant fragments of video lectures according to user's history. Potential implications of this approach for lifelong learning are discussed. We argue that this approach is generally applicable to recommender and information retrieval systems, across multiple knowledge domains and document types.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Future User Interfaces", "Information Retrieval", "Intelligent Tutoring Systems", "OER", "Open Education Resources", "Recommender Systems", "User Modeling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Intelligent tutoring system", "Knowledge domains", "Learning resource", "Life long learning", "Open Education Resources", "Personalised learning", "User Modeling", "Video lectures"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082169426", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"]], "AuthorData": {"57214930945": {"Name": "Bulathwela S.", "AuthorID": "57214930945", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "41461548700": {"Name": "Kreitmayer S.", "AuthorID": "41461548700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "35068542300": {"Name": "P\u00e9rez-Ortiz M.", "AuthorID": "35068542300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
