International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Objectives: Young onset dementia is associated with distinctive support needs but existing research on service provision has been largely small scale and qualitative. Our objective was to explore service use, cost and satisfaction across the UK. Methods: Information about socio-demographic characteristics, service use and satisfaction were gathered from people with young onset dementia (YOD) and/or a family member/supporter via a national survey. Results: Two hundred and thirty-three responses were analysed. Diagnosis was most commonly received through a Memory Clinic or Neurology. The type of service delivering diagnosis impacted on post-diagnostic care. Those diagnosed in specialist YOD services were more likely to receive support within the first 6 weeks and receive ongoing care in the service where they were diagnosed. Ongoing care management arrangements varied but generally care was lacking. Around 42% reported no follow-up during 6-weeks after diagnosis; over a third reported seeing no health professional within the previous 3 months; just over a third had a key worker and just under a third had a care plan. Satisfaction and quality of care were highest in specialist services. Almost 60% of family members spent over 5 h per day caring; median costs of health and social care, 3 months, 2018, were \u00a3394 (interquartile range \u00a3389 to 640). Conclusions: Variation across diagnostic and post-diagnostic care pathways for YOD leads to disparate experiences, with specialist young onset services being associated with better continuity, quality and satisfaction. More specialist services are needed so all with YOD can access age-appropriate care.", "AuthorKeywords": ["(3-10)", "Alzheimer's disease", "care pathways", "caregivers", "early onset dementia", "frontotemporal dementia", "rare dementias", "service costs", "services"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092140604", "SubjectAreas": [["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57191201344": {"Name": "Stamou V.", "AuthorID": "57191201344", "AffiliationID": "60022046", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Manchester Metropolitan University"}, "6603407652": {"Name": "La Fontaine J.", "AuthorID": "6603407652", "AffiliationID": "60008524", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Applied Dementia Studies, Faculty of Health Studies, University of Bradford"}, "8572540600": {"Name": "Oyebode J.", "AuthorID": "8572540600", "AffiliationID": "60008524", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Applied Dementia Studies, Faculty of Health Studies, University of Bradford"}, "55293721200": {"Name": "Gage H.", "AuthorID": "55293721200", "AffiliationID": "60172391, 60021097", "AffiliationName": "Surrey Health Economics Centre, Department of Economics, University of Surrey"}, "57190953032": {"Name": "Jones B.", "AuthorID": "57190953032", "AffiliationID": "60172391, 60021097", "AffiliationName": "Surrey Health Economics Centre, Department of Economics, University of Surrey"}, "57217343255": {"Name": "Williams P.", "AuthorID": "57217343255", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University of Surrey"}, "57212606592": {"Name": "O'Malley M.", "AuthorID": "57212606592", "AffiliationID": "60004814", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Sciences, University of West London"}, "56480135100": {"Name": "Parkes J.", "AuthorID": "56480135100", "AffiliationID": "60000931", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Applied Mental Health Research, Faculty of Health and Society, University of Northampton"}, "7403988184": {"Name": "Carter J.", "AuthorID": "7403988184", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}}}
