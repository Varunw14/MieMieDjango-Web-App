Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.Background: A high prevalence of cardiac abnormalities has been reported in children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa. We investigated the incidence and progression of cardiac abnormalities among children taking ART in Zimbabwe. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted at a pediatric HIV clinic from 2014 to 2017. Children with HIV aged between 6 and 16 years and taking ART \u22656 months were enrolled. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed at baseline and after 18 months. Results: Of 197 participants recruited at baseline, 175 (89%; 48% female; median age 12 years, interquartile range 10-14 years) were followed up. The incidences of left and right heart abnormalities were 3.52 and 5.64 per 100 person-years, respectively. Stunting was associated with the development of any cardiac abnormality (adjusted odds ratio 2.59, 95% confidence interval 1.03-6.49; P =. 043). Right ventricular (RV) dilatation persisted at follow-up in 92% of participants and left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction in 88%. Cardiac abnormalities present at baseline reverted to normal over the follow-up period in 11 (6%). There was an overall increase in mean z scores for LV, left atrium (LA), RV, interventricular septum, and LV posterior wall diameters at 18 months (P <. 001). Conclusions: Despite ART, children with HIV have a high incidence of cardiac abnormalities, with only a minority being transient. Mean z scores for LV, LA, RV, interventricular septum, and LV posterior wall diameters increased over a relatively short follow-up period, suggesting the potential for progression of cardiac abnormalities. Longer follow-up is required to understand the clinical implications of these abnormalities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ART", "cardiac abnormalities", "children", "echocardiography", "HIV"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Africa South of the Sahara", "Aged", "Child", "Echocardiography", "Female", "HIV", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Incidence", "Male", "Prospective Studies", "Ventricular Dysfunction, Left", "Zimbabwe"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082092757", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"55681496800": {"Name": "Majonga E.D.", "AuthorID": "55681496800", "AffiliationID": "60063284", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research and Training Institute"}, "36461698700": {"Name": "Rehman A.M.", "AuthorID": "36461698700", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "14218935700": {"Name": "Ferrand R.A.", "AuthorID": "14218935700", "AffiliationID": "60063284", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research and Training Institute"}, "56113055000": {"Name": "McHugh G.", "AuthorID": "56113055000", "AffiliationID": "60063284", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research and Training Institute"}, "25936533800": {"Name": "Mujuru H.A.", "AuthorID": "25936533800", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "University of Zimbabwe"}, "57210663714": {"Name": "Nathoo K.", "AuthorID": "57210663714", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "University of Zimbabwe"}, "7004261470": {"Name": "Odland J.O.", "AuthorID": "7004261470", "AffiliationID": "60021902", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, University of Pretoria"}, "16204898600": {"Name": "Kaski J.P.", "AuthorID": "16204898600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}}}
