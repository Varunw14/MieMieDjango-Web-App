Objective: To develop a scale to monitor clinical deficits in patients with PSP across its broad phenotypes. Methods: The Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Clinical Deficits Scale was conceptualized to cover seven clinical domains (Akinesia-rigidity, Bradyphrenia, Communication, Dysphagia, Eye movements, Finger dexterity, and Gait & balance), each scored from 0 to 3 (no, mild, moderate, or severe deficits). User guidelines were developed to standardize its application. Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Clinical Deficits Scale scores were collected in patients fulfilling the MDS-PSP diagnostic criteria in two independent, multicenter, observational studies, both cross-sectionally (exploratory DescribePSP cohort; confirmatory ProPSP cohort) and longitudinally (12-months\u2019 follow-up, both cohorts). Results: Cognitive pretesting demonstrated easy scale utility. In total, 164 patients were scored (70.4 \u00b1 7.6 years; 62% males, 35% variant phenotypes). Mean Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Clinical Deficits Scale completion time was 4 minutes. The Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Clinical Deficits Scale total score correlated with existing scales (e.g., Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Rating Scale: R = 0.88; P < 0.001). Individual Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Clinical Deficits Scale items correlated well with similar constructs in existing scales. Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha: 0.75), inter-rater reliability (0.96), and test-retest stability (0.99) were acceptable. The PSP-CDS showed significant 12-month change (baseline, 8.6 \u00b1 3.6; follow-up: 10.8 \u00b1 3.6; annualized difference: 3.4 \u00b1 3.4; n = 49; P < 0.0001). Sample sizes required per arm for a two-arm, 1-year follow-up therapeutic trial to detect 50% change in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Clinical Deficits Scale progression was estimated to be 65 (two-sided, two-sample t test). Conclusion: The Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Clinical Deficits Scale is a rapidly completed, clinimetrically sound scale for clinical care and research involving PSP. \u00a9 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.", "AuthorKeywords": ["clinical rating scales", "outcome measures", "power calculation", "progressive supranuclear palsy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078612752", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57210587376": {"Name": "Piot I.", "AuthorID": "57210587376", "AffiliationID": "60023588", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Basel"}, "57202925506": {"Name": "Schweyer K.", "AuthorID": "57202925506", "AffiliationID": "60019722", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Technical University of Munich"}, "34968463600": {"Name": "Respondek G.", "AuthorID": "34968463600", "AffiliationID": "60024052", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Hannover Medical School"}, "6602778605": {"Name": "H\u00f6glinger G.U.", "AuthorID": "6602778605", "AffiliationID": "60024052", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Hannover Medical School"}, "57208560010": {"Name": "Stamelou M.", "AuthorID": "57208560010", "AffiliationID": "60012556", "AffiliationName": "Neurology Clinic, Philipps University"}, "57128621300": {"Name": "Sckopke P.", "AuthorID": "57128621300", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University"}, "34572979200": {"Name": "Schenk T.", "AuthorID": "34572979200", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University"}, "36063561200": {"Name": "Goetz C.G.", "AuthorID": "36063561200", "AffiliationID": "60018691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurological Sciences, Rush University Medical Center"}, "56933550900": {"Name": "Stebbins G.T.", "AuthorID": "56933550900", "AffiliationID": "60018691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurological Sciences, Rush University Medical Center"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
