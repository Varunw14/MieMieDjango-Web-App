BC has many remarkable properties such as its attractive mechanical properties, water uptake ability and biocompatibility which makes it a very desirable material to be used for wound healing. Inherently due to these important properties, the material is very resistant to easy processing and thus difficult to produce into useful entities. Additionally, being rate limited by the dependency on bacterial production, high yield is difficult to obtain and thus secondary material processing is sought after. In this review, BC is explained in terms of synthesis, structure and properties. These beneficial properties are directly related to the material's great potential in wound healing where it has also been trialled commercially but ultimately failed due to processing issues. However, more recently there has been increased frequency in scientific work relating to BC processing into hybrid polymeric fibres using common laboratory fibre forming techniques such as electrospinning and pressurised gyration. This paper summarises current progress in BC fibre manufacturing, its downfalls and also gives a future perspective on how the landscape should change to allow BC to be utilised in wound care in the current environment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bacterial cellulose", "Fibre production", "Fibres", "Gluconacetobacter xylinum", "Wound healing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bacterial cellulose", "Bacterial production", "Forming techniques", "Future perspectives", "Secondary materials", "Structure and properties", "Wound healing", "Wound healing applications", "Bacteria", "Cellulose", "Polymers", "Wound Healing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083712196", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology", "IMMU", "2402"]], "AuthorData": {"57200420958": {"Name": "Ahmed J.", "AuthorID": "57200420958", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006247915": {"Name": "Edirisinghe M.", "AuthorID": "7006247915", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "56598063500": {"Name": "Gultekinoglu M.", "AuthorID": "56598063500", "AffiliationID": "60020484", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Hacettepe University"}}}
