Measurements of triceps skinfold thickness (TSFT) and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) are used to estimate muscle mass. An arteriovenous fistula is the preferred vascular access for HD patients, and we wished to determine whether anthropometric measurements were affected by the fistula and HD treatment. One hundred and forty-four HD patients, 90 (62.5%) males, mean age 63.1 \u00b1 15.4 years, had measurements pre- and post-HD. TSFT was similar in the arms, whereas MUAC and corrected mid-upper arm muscle circumference (CMUAMC) were greater in the fistula compared with the non-fistula arm (MUAC pre-HD 30.0 \u00b1 5.2 vs 29.2 \u00b1 4.7 and post-HD 29.6 \u00b1 5.1 vs 28.5 \u00b1 4.7, p < 0.001; MUAMC 23.5 \u00b1 4.0 vs 22.5 \u00b1 4.1, and post-HD 22.9 \u00b1 4.0, and 22.0 \u00b1 3.7 cm p < 0.01). Following HD; TSFT did not change, but MUAC and CMUAMC fell significantly in both arms (p < 0.01). When screening for sarcopenia in HD patients, anthropometric measurements should be taken post-HD in the non-fistula arm.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077315342", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"57212683244": {"Name": "Al-Joudi E.", "AuthorID": "57212683244", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Clinical and Public Health Nutrition, University College London"}, "55250435400": {"Name": "Slee A.", "AuthorID": "55250435400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Clinical and Public Health Nutrition, University College London"}, "55437680000": {"Name": "Davenport A.", "AuthorID": "55437680000", "AffiliationID": "60176023, 60182839", "AffiliationName": "UCL Division of Medicine, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Department of Nephrology, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
