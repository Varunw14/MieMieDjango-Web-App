By adding reconfigurable switching elements to the core of an optical star topology, simulations show that the expected transmission rate per node can be increased by 26\u201340% (at 90% and 70% network load respectively). The proposed architecture shows no loss of multicast functionality compared to a single passive optical star, and only 7.1% increase in power consumption. Network throughput is shown to be highly dependent on the network traffic pattern, with simulations of multicast zonal media production traffic showing 6 times greater throughput than random or hotspot traffic models.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Multicast functionality", "Network throughput", "Optical star networks", "Proposed architectures", "Switching elements", "Throughput capacities", "Transmission bandwidth", "Transmission rates"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078657614", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57188685614": {"Name": "Funnell A.C.", "AuthorID": "57188685614", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Work Performed at Optical Networks Group, University College London"}, "57109797700": {"Name": "Butler D.", "AuthorID": "57109797700", "AffiliationID": "60091909", "AffiliationName": "BBC Research and Development"}, "9274397600": {"Name": "Zervas G.", "AuthorID": "9274397600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, University College London"}}}
