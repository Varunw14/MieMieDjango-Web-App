The co-stimulatory molecule CD27 is a marker of highly suppressive Tregs, although the role of the CD27-CD70 receptor-ligand interaction in Tregs is not clear. Here we show that after prolonged in vitro stimulation, a significant proportion of human Tregs gain stable CD70 expression while losing CD27. The expression of CD70 in expanded Tregs is associated with a profound loss of regulatory function and an unusual ability to provide CD70-directed co-stimulation to TCR-activated conventional T cells. Genetic deletion of CD70 or its blockade prevents Tregs from delivering this co-stimulatory signal, thus maintaining their regulatory activity. High resolution targeted single-cell RNA sequencing of human peripheral blood confirms the presence of CD27\u2212CD70+ Treg cells. These findings have important implications for Treg-based clinical studies where cells are expanded over extended periods in order to achieve sufficient treatment doses.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087960525", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"]], "AuthorData": {"57194733668": {"Name": "Arroyo Hornero R.", "AuthorID": "57194733668", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60008323, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Transplantation Research and Immunology Group, Nuffield Department of Surgical Sciences, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford"}, "7401835685": {"Name": "Wood K.J.", "AuthorID": "7401835685", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60008323, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Transplantation Research and Immunology Group, Nuffield Department of Surgical Sciences, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford"}, "26321669500": {"Name": "Issa F.", "AuthorID": "26321669500", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60008323, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Transplantation Research and Immunology Group, Nuffield Department of Surgical Sciences, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford"}, "57216330786": {"Name": "Hester J.", "AuthorID": "57216330786", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60008323, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Transplantation Research and Immunology Group, Nuffield Department of Surgical Sciences, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford"}, "57150711600": {"Name": "Georgiadis C.", "AuthorID": "57150711600", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Molecular and Cellular Immunology Unit, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "11739326500": {"Name": "Qasim W.", "AuthorID": "11739326500", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Molecular and Cellular Immunology Unit, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57191898242": {"Name": "Hua P.", "AuthorID": "57191898242", "AffiliationID": "60008323, 60001633, 60002634, 60016410", "AffiliationName": "MRC Molecular Haematology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "57212010652": {"Name": "Trzupek D.", "AuthorID": "57212010652", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851, 60172675, 60099539", "AffiliationName": "JDRF/Wellcome Diabetes and Inflammation Laboratory, Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, University of Oxford"}, "57197088090": {"Name": "Todd J.A.", "AuthorID": "57197088090", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851, 60172675, 60099539", "AffiliationName": "JDRF/Wellcome Diabetes and Inflammation Laboratory, Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, University of Oxford"}, "35080337400": {"Name": "Ferreira R.C.", "AuthorID": "35080337400", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851, 60172675, 60099539", "AffiliationName": "JDRF/Wellcome Diabetes and Inflammation Laboratory, Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, University of Oxford"}, "26663133000": {"Name": "He L.Z.", "AuthorID": "26663133000", "AffiliationID": "60101503", "AffiliationName": "Celldex Therapeutics, Inc."}}}
