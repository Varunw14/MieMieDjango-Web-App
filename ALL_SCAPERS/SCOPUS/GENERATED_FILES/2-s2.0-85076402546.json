Patients and Methods: PICTURE was a paired-cohort confirmatory study in which 249 men who required further risk stratification after a previous non-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsy underwent a 3-Tesla (3T) multiparametic (mp)MRI consisting of T2-weighted imaging (T2W), DWI and DCE, followed by transperineal template prostate mapping biopsy. Each mpMRI was reported using a LIKERT score in a sequential blinded manner to generate scores for T2W, T2W+DWI and T2W+DWI+DCE. Area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analysis was performed to compare the diagnostic accuracy of each combination. The threshold for a positive mpMRI was set at a LIKERT score \u22653. Clinically significant prostate cancer was analysed across a range of definitions including UCL/Ahmed definition 1 (primary definition), UCL/Ahmed definition 2, any Gleason \u22653 + 4 and any Gleason \u22654 + 3. Results: Of 249 men, sequential MRI reporting was available for 246. There was a higher rate of equivocal lesions (44.6%) using T2W alone compared to the addition of DWI (23.9%) and DCE (19.8%). Using the primary definition of clinically significant disease, there was no significant difference in the overall accuracy between T2W, with an AUROC of 0.74 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68\u20130.80), T2W+DWI at 0.76 (95% CI 0.71\u20130.82), and T2W+DWI+DCE, with an AUROC of 0.77 (95% CI 0.71\u20130.82; P = 0.55). The AUROC values remained comparable using other definitions of clinically significant disease including UCL/Ahmed definition 2 (P = 0.79), Gleason \u22653 + 4 (P = 0.53) and Gleason \u22654 + 3 (P = 0.53). Conclusions: Using 3T MRI, a high level of diagnostic accuracy can be achieved using T2W as a single parameter in men with a prior biopsy; however, such a strategy can lead to a higher rate of equivocal lesions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["#PCSM", "#ProstateCancer", "biparametric MRI", "diffusion-weighted imaging", "dynamic contrast enhancement", "prostate cancer", "transperineal template prostate mapping biopsy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Cohort Studies", "Contrast Media", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Humans", "Image-Guided Biopsy", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Prostatic Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076402546", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"55752715900": {"Name": "Eldred-Evans D.", "AuthorID": "55752715900", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "57114379700": {"Name": "Shah T.T.", "AuthorID": "57114379700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London, Faculty of Medical Sciences"}, "7005977360": {"Name": "Arya M.", "AuthorID": "7005977360", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London, Faculty of Medical Sciences"}, "8147855500": {"Name": "Ahmed H.U.", "AuthorID": "8147855500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London, Faculty of Medical Sciences"}, "57194391748": {"Name": "Neves J.B.", "AuthorID": "57194391748", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "37038344200": {"Name": "Simmons L.A.M.", "AuthorID": "37038344200", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55937799900": {"Name": "Kanthabalan A.", "AuthorID": "55937799900", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "54382137700": {"Name": "McCartan N.", "AuthorID": "54382137700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London, Faculty of Medical Sciences"}, "7402982572": {"Name": "Moore C.M.", "AuthorID": "7402982572", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004667094": {"Name": "Emberton M.", "AuthorID": "7004667094", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004357370": {"Name": "Charman S.C.", "AuthorID": "7004357370", "AffiliationID": "60008659", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Effectiveness Unit, The Royal College of Surgeons of England"}, "8972541300": {"Name": "Freeman A.", "AuthorID": "8972541300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57220423487": {"Name": "Punwani S.", "AuthorID": "57220423487", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, Division of Medicine, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University College London"}}}
