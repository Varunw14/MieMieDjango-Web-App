Systemic \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-AR) activation has been shown to mobilize TCR-\u03b3\u03b4 T-cells to the blood, potentially serving as an adjuvant for alloHCT and TCR-\u03b3\u03b4 T-cell therapy. We investigated if systemic \u03b2-AR activation, using acute dynamic exercise as an experimental model, can increase the mobilization, ex vivo expansion, and anti-tumor activity of TCR-\u03b3\u03b4 T-cells isolated from the blood of healthy humans. We also sought to investigate the \u03b2-AR subtypes involved, by administering a preferential \u03b21-AR antagonist (bisoprolol) and a non-preferential \u03b21 + \u03b22-AR antagonist (nadolol) prior to exercise as part of a randomized placebo controlled cross-over experiment. We found that exercise mobilized TCR-\u03b3\u03b4 cells to blood and augmented their ex vivo expansion by ~182% compared to resting blood when stimulated with IL-2 and ZOL for 14-days. Exercise also increased the proportion of CD56+, NKG2D+/CD62L\u2013, CD158a/b/e+ and NKG2A\u2212 cells among the expanded TCR-\u03b3\u03b4 cells, and increased their cytotoxic activity against several tumor target cells (K562, U266, 221.AEH) in vitro by 40\u201360%. Blocking NKG2D on TCR-\u03b3\u03b4 cells in vitro eliminated the augmented cytotoxic effects of exercise against U266 target cells. Furthermore, administering a \u03b21 + \u03b22-AR (nadolol), but not a \u03b21-AR (bisoprolol) antagonist prior to exercise abrogated the exercise-induced enhancement in TCR-\u03b3\u03b4 T-cell mobilization and ex vivo expansion. Furthermore, nadolol completely abrogated while bisoprolol partially inhibited the exercise-induced increase in the cytotoxic activity of the expanded TCR-\u03b3\u03b4 T-cells. We conclude that acute systemic \u03b2-AR activation in healthy donors markedly augments the mobilization, ex vivo expansion, and anti-tumor activity of TCR-\u03b3\u03b4 T-cells and that some of these effects are due to \u03b22-AR signaling and phenotypic shifts that promote a dominant activating signal via NKG2D. These findings highlight \u03b2-ARs as potential targets to favorably alter the composition of allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell grafts and improve the potency of TCR-\u03b3\u03b4 T-cell immune cell therapeutics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adoptive transfer immunotherapy", "beta-blockers", "exercise", "exercise immunology", "gamma-delta t-cells"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adrenergic beta-Agonists", "Adrenergic beta-Antagonists", "Adult", "Bisoprolol", "Cell Line", "Cell Proliferation", "Cytotoxicity, Immunologic", "Exercise", "Female", "Graft vs Tumor Effect", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Humans", "Immunotherapy, Adoptive", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Male", "Nadolol", "Neoplasms", "Receptors, Adrenergic", "Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta", "T-Lymphocytes", "Transplantation, Homologous", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079107204", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"57196064710": {"Name": "Baker F.L.", "AuthorID": "57196064710", "AffiliationID": "60010065", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Arizona"}, "54418573100": {"Name": "Bigley A.B.", "AuthorID": "54418573100", "AffiliationID": "60005837", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Integrated Physiology, Department of Health and Human Performance, University of Houston"}, "55121908900": {"Name": "Agha N.H.", "AuthorID": "55121908900", "AffiliationID": "60005837", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Integrated Physiology, Department of Health and Human Performance, University of Houston"}, "7401497139": {"Name": "O'Connor D.P.", "AuthorID": "7401497139", "AffiliationID": "60005837", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Integrated Physiology, Department of Health and Human Performance, University of Houston"}, "57202704112": {"Name": "Simpson R.J.", "AuthorID": "57202704112", "AffiliationID": "60010065", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunobiology, University of Arizona"}, "7006066391": {"Name": "Katsanis E.", "AuthorID": "7006066391", "AffiliationID": "60010065", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunobiology, University of Arizona"}, "8502823700": {"Name": "Pedlar C.R.", "AuthorID": "8502823700", "AffiliationID": "60108766", "AffiliationName": "School of Sport, Health and Applied Science, St. Mary's University"}, "7102696356": {"Name": "Bond R.A.", "AuthorID": "7102696356", "AffiliationID": "60005837", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacological and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Houston"}, "6602777360": {"Name": "Bollard C.M.", "AuthorID": "6602777360", "AffiliationID": "60005723, 60003088", "AffiliationName": "Center for Cancer and Immunology Research, Children's National Health System and the George Washington University"}}}
