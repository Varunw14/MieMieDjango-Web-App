The model takes inspiration from particle swarm optimisation, abstracting a shared goal as a shared optimisation task, and modelling the personality differences in team members as strategies for moving within, interpreting and sharing information about the solution space. We update the model and add a genetic algorithm in order to investigate the effects of differing initial ideas within teams of different personality combinations as they attempt to collaborate to achieve their shared task. We run experiments on homogeneous teams with similar personalities and heterogeneous teams with random personalities and find that increased diversity in team members' initial ideas significantly improves teamwork, and more so for teams comprising individuals with similar personalities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["agent-based modelling", "collaboration", "genetic algorithm", "personality psychology", "teamwork"], "IndexKeywords": ["Agent-based model", "Agent-based modelling", "collaboration", "Particle swarm optimisation", "personality psychology", "Sharing information", "Solution space", "teamwork"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071319977", "SubjectAreas": [["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"]], "AuthorData": {"27169737500": {"Name": "Lim S.L.", "AuthorID": "27169737500", "AffiliationID": "60172701, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, UCL, Braintree Research Lab, Braintree Ltd"}, "24466639300": {"Name": "Bentley P.J.", "AuthorID": "24466639300", "AffiliationID": "60172701, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, UCL, Braintree Research Lab, Braintree Ltd"}}}
