All rights reserved.Paroxysmal movement disorders are defined as abnormal involuntary movements that are intermittent or episodic in nature, with sudden onset and with no change in consciousness. Subgroups can be distinguished according to triggering factors and include the kinesigenic variant (PKD). Here, attacks are typically triggered by sudden movement and last seconds only. The disorder is due to mutations in the proline-rich transmembrane protein 2 (PRRT2) gene. There is also suggestion of genetic heterogeneity. Carbamazepine is the drug of choice. Phenytoin and valproate are good alternatives. Clinical features, genetic findings, pathophysiology, diagnostic principles and treatment responses are further discussed in the article.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attacks", "Demirkiran-Jankovic classification", "ICCA syndrome", "Infantile convulsions", "Involuntary movements", "Paroxysmal choreo-athetosis", "Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia", "PKD", "Proline-rich transmembrane protein 2", "PRRT2 gene", "RE-PED-WC", "Rolandic epilepsy-paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesia-writer\u2019s cramp", "Sudden movements", "Triggering factors"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079565295", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"14036326000": {"Name": "Schneider S.A.", "AuthorID": "14036326000", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich"}, "36008087300": {"Name": "Erro R.", "AuthorID": "36008087300", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich"}, "25958636400": {"Name": "Bhatia K.P.", "AuthorID": "25958636400", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich"}}}
