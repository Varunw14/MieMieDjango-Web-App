Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.Aims: Most clinical risk stratification models are based on measurement at a single time-point rather than serial measurements. Artificial intelligence (AI) is able to predict one-dimensional outcomes from multi-dimensional datasets. Using data from Global Anticoagulant Registry in the Field (GARFIELD)-AF registry, a new AI model was developed for predicting clinical outcomes in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients up to 1 year based on sequential measures of prothrombin time international normalized ratio (PT-INR) within 30 days of enrolment. Methods and results: Patients with newly diagnosed AF who were treated with Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and had at least three measurements of PT-INR taken over the first 30 days after prescription were analysed. The AI model was constructed with multilayer neural network including long short-term memory and one-dimensional convolution layers. The neural network was trained using PT-INR measurements within days 0-30 after starting treatment and clinical outcomes over days 31-365 in a derivation cohort (cohorts 1-3; n = 3185). Accuracy of the AI model at predicting major bleed, stroke/systemic embolism (SE), and death was assessed in a validation cohort (cohorts 4-5; n = 1523). The model's c-statistic for predicting major bleed, stroke/SE, and all-cause death was 0.75, 0.70, and 0.61, respectively. Conclusions: Using serial PT-INR values collected within 1 month after starting VKA, the new AI model performed better than time in therapeutic range at predicting clinical outcomes occurring up to 12 months thereafter. Serial PT-INR values contain important information that can be analysed by computer to help predict adverse clinical outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Artificial intelligence", "Atrial fibrillation", "Machine learning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Oral", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Anticoagulants", "Atrial Fibrillation", "Blood Coagulation", "Databases, Factual", "Drug Monitoring", "Drug Therapy, Computer-Assisted", "Female", "Hemorrhage", "Humans", "International Normalized Ratio", "Male", "Neural Networks, Computer", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prospective Studies", "Prothrombin Time", "Registries", "Reproducibility of Results", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Stroke", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome", "Vitamin K"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091126681", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"56602192600": {"Name": "Goto S.", "AuthorID": "56602192600", "AffiliationID": "60025252", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Keio University School of Medicine"}, "57204926077": {"Name": "Goto S.", "AuthorID": "57204926077", "AffiliationID": "60028799", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine (Cardiology), Tokai University School of Medicine"}, "35404167300": {"Name": "Pieper K.S.", "AuthorID": "35404167300", "AffiliationID": "60014574", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Research, Thrombosis Research Institute"}, "7005582756": {"Name": "Bassand J.P.", "AuthorID": "7005582756", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, University of Besan\u00e7on Boulevard Fleming"}, "56402821900": {"Name": "Kakkar A.K.", "AuthorID": "56402821900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, University College London"}, "57204743826": {"Name": "Camm A.J.", "AuthorID": "57204743826", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Clinical Academic Group, Molecular and Clinical Sciences Institute, St. George's University of London"}, "7006675579": {"Name": "Fitzmaurice D.A.", "AuthorID": "7006675579", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardio-respiratory Primary Care, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "57209056809": {"Name": "Goldhaber S.Z.", "AuthorID": "57209056809", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women's Hospital"}, "7201364240": {"Name": "Haas S.", "AuthorID": "7201364240", "AffiliationID": "60103459, 60019722", "AffiliationName": "Formerly Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich"}, "57189647289": {"Name": "Parkhomenko A.", "AuthorID": "57189647289", "AffiliationID": "60008794, 60112613", "AffiliationName": "National Scientific Center, Strazhesko Institute of Cardiology"}, "57190758767": {"Name": "Oto A.", "AuthorID": "57190758767", "AffiliationID": "100794210", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Memorial Ankara Hospital"}, "7004763308": {"Name": "Misselwitz F.", "AuthorID": "7004763308", "AffiliationID": "60006680", "AffiliationName": "Therapeutic areas Thrombosis and Hematology, Bayer AG"}, "16837601300": {"Name": "Turpie A.G.G.", "AuthorID": "16837601300", "AffiliationID": "60031828", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, McMaster University"}, "35379802700": {"Name": "Verheugt F.W.A.", "AuthorID": "35379802700", "AffiliationID": "60022969", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis (OLVG)"}, "57219346127": {"Name": "Fox K.A.A.", "AuthorID": "57219346127", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272, 60010973", "AffiliationName": "Edinburgh Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh, Queen's Medical Research Institute"}, "35371853600": {"Name": "Gersh B.J.", "AuthorID": "35371853600", "AffiliationID": "60026829", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine"}}}
