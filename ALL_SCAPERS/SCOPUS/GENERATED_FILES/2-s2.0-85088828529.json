We conducted a survey to investigate the current practices in the European epilepsy monitoring units (EMUs) and the data that EMUs could provide to retrospectively detect cases with postoperative PNES and to assess the feasibility of a subsequent postoperative PNES research project for cases with postoperative PNES. Methods: We developed and distributed a questionnaire survey to 57 EMUs. Questions addressed the number of patients undergoing epilepsy surgery, the performance of systematic preoperative and postoperative psychiatric evaluation, the recording of sexual or other abuse, the follow-up period of patients undergoing epilepsy surgery, the performance of video-electroencephalogram (EEG) and postoperative psychiatric assessment in suspected postoperative cases with PNES, the existence of electronic databases to allow extraction of cases with postoperative PNES, the data that these bases could provide, and EMUs' interest to participate in a retrospective postoperative PNES project. Results: Twenty EMUs completed the questionnaire sheet. The number of patients operated every year/per center is 26.7 (+ 19.1), and systematic preoperative and postoperative psychiatric evaluation is performed in 75% and 50% of the EMUs accordingly. Sexual or other abuse is systematically recorded in one-third of the centers, and the mean follow-up period after epilepsy surgery is 10.5 \u00b1 7.5 years. In suspected postoperative PNES, video-EEG is performed in 85% and psychiatric assessment in 95% of the centers. An electronic database to allow extraction of patients with PNES after epilepsy surgery is used in 75% of the EMUs, and all EMUs that sent the sheet completed expressed their interest to participate in a retrospective postoperative PNES project. Conclusion: Postoperative PNES is an underestimated and not well-studied entity. This is a European survey to assess the type of data that the EMUs surgical cohorts could provide to retrospectively detect postoperative PNES. In cases with suspected PNES, most EMUs perform video-EEG and psychiatric assessment, and most EMUs use an electronic database to allow extraction of patients developing PNES.", "AuthorKeywords":
