All rights reserved.Boundary objects are tools used to transfer knowledge across organisational and functional divides. Where boundaries can create challenges for organisational learning and knowledge management, boundary objects can be an effective tool for overcoming them through translation and communication. Much of the project work in today's large infrastructure organisations is carried out by cross-functional teams under pressure to deliver project objectives on time and within budget and it is crucial for staff to access meaningful information and knowledge from experts in the organisations involved in projects and from other areas of the business. Understanding the features that make boundary objects effective can improve organisational learning and better inform decision-making, eventually improving organisational performance. This paper assesses whether the features of boundary objects found to be effective in biological and manufacturing environments are valid in project-based industries, particularly construction. The findings suggest that, by maximising the efficacy of boundary objects, large construction organisations can address the knowledge-sharing issues literature has identified as arising from the complex and temporary nature of construction projects. This article contributes to theory by identifying three new features of boundary objects, in addition to those listed by Leigh Star, that are used effectively in the organisation under scrutiny. The findings also demonstrate that all of the features in Star's theory contribute to knowledge transfer in a project-based environment, although not all are as effective compared to other industries.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Boundary objects", "Construction projects", "Knowledge sharing", "Organisational learning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Boundary objects", "Construction organisations", "Construction projects", "Knowledge-sharing", "Manufacturing environments", "Organisational learning", "Organisational performance", "Project-based organisations"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073325733", "SubjectAreas": [["Information Systems and Management", "DECI", "1802"], ["Management Science and Operations Research", "DECI", "1803"]], "AuthorData": {"57211288958": {"Name": "Butters R.", "AuthorID": "57211288958", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55243351300": {"Name": "Duryan M.", "AuthorID": "55243351300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
