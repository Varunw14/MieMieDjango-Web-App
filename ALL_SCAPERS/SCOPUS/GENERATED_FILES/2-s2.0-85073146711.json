Healthcare services need to address this burden of preventable disease. Methods: We evaluated the impact of a brief intervention that asked service users about smoking when they attended for ambulatory HIV care in London, UK, and offered referral to smoking cessation. Results: Overall, 1548 HIV-positive individuals were asked about their smoking status over a 12-month period. Of this group, 385 (25%) reported that they were current smokers, 372 (97%) were offered referral to smoking cessation services and 154 (40%) accepted this. We established an outcome of referral for 114 (74%) individuals. A total of 36 (10% of smokers) attended stop smoking clinics and 16 (4%) individuals were recorded as having quit smoking. Discussion: The simple intervention of asking PLWH about tobacco smoking and offering referral to smoking cessation services rapidly identified current smokers, 40% of whom accepted referral to smoking cessation services. This highlights the importance of promoting behaviour and lifestyle changes with every contact with health services. However, a large proportion of those referred were either not seen in local services or the outcome of referral could not be ascertained. If the risk of smoking-related morbidity among PLWH is to be reduced, more sustainable referral pathways and ways of improving uptake of smoking cessation services must be developed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Tobacco and the lung"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073146711", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"55547124471": {"Name": "Brown J.", "AuthorID": "55547124471", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory Medicine, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57211253554": {"Name": "Kyriacou C.", "AuthorID": "57211253554", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory Medicine, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57201381285": {"Name": "Pickett E.", "AuthorID": "57201381285", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory Medicine, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57213382466": {"Name": "Edwards K.", "AuthorID": "57213382466", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory Medicine, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57211253818": {"Name": "Joshi H.", "AuthorID": "57211253818", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory Medicine, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57211252416": {"Name": "Stewart N.", "AuthorID": "57211252416", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory Medicine, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57211254668": {"Name": "Melville A.", "AuthorID": "57211254668", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory Medicine, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57211251657": {"Name": "Flint J.", "AuthorID": "57211251657", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory Medicine, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56689760700": {"Name": "Bartley A.", "AuthorID": "56689760700", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory Medicine, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56339842100": {"Name": "Johnson M.", "AuthorID": "56339842100", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory and HIV Medicine, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35944368900": {"Name": "Rodger A.", "AuthorID": "35944368900", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London Medical School"}, "57195311478": {"Name": "Lipman M.", "AuthorID": "57195311478", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Respiratory, University College London"}}}
