LTBI can be due to infection with either drug-sensitive or drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains. Accurate data on the prevalence of LTBI due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mtb strains are unavailable, since the strains cannot be isolated for resistance testing. There are no \u2018gold standard\u2019 tests for accurately diagnosing LTBI. Only three tests are currently available and approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the diagnosis of LTBI: the now outdated tuberculin skin test (TST), developed a century year ago, and the two interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) developed and rolled out over the past decade, the QuantiFERON (Qiagen, Germany) and T-SPOT.TB (Oxford Immunotec, United Kingdom) tests. These latter tests are not ideal due to issues of sensitivity, specificity, inability to distinguish infection with MDR-Mtb strains, and high costs. Achieving the WHO End TB Strategy target of an 80% reduction in global TB incidence by 2030 will require a major reduction in the number of persons with LTBI progressing to active TB disease. Critical to this will be the development of new diagnostic tests that are better than currently available LTBI tests at predicting who is at risk of progression to active TB disease. The diagnostic product development portfolio for LTBI appears to have reached the end of the road. Every attempt to make optimal use of currently available IGRAs using WHO LTBI guidelines for LTBI testing and treatment must be made to achieve WHO End TB strategy targets.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diagnostic tests", "Latent TB infection", "MDR-TB", "Tuberculosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Disease Progression", "Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial", "Humans", "Interferon-gamma Release Tests", "Latent Tuberculosis", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Tuberculin Test"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081888859", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"56744548100": {"Name": "Mwaba P.", "AuthorID": "56744548100", "AffiliationID": "60072796, 60072797", "AffiliationName": "Apex University School of Medicine, and UNZA-UCLMS Research and Training Program"}, "6603047953": {"Name": "Chakaya J.M.", "AuthorID": "6603047953", "AffiliationID": "60057297", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Kenyatta University"}, "7202854790": {"Name": "Petersen E.", "AuthorID": "7202854790", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health Science, University of Aarhus"}, "23006611600": {"Name": "Wejse C.", "AuthorID": "23006611600", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Center for Global Health, Department of Health Services Research, Aarhus University"}, "57216109256": {"Name": "Zumla A.", "AuthorID": "57216109256", "AffiliationID": "60020661, 60176023, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Microbiology, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, and NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, UCL Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "23992930000": {"Name": "Kapata N.", "AuthorID": "23992930000", "AffiliationID": "60072803", "AffiliationName": "Zambia National Public Health Institute, Ministry of Health"}}}
