A structure-stability relationship has been explored to investigate trends in stability, depending on the aromatic substituent and the structure of the secondary amine component of the diazonium salts and triazenes. All of the triazenes investigated show significantly greater stability (many are stable above 200 \u00b0C) compared with the corresponding diazonium salts, which show varying stabilities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["continuous processing", "diazonium salt", "DSC", "thermal stability", "triazene"], "IndexKeywords": ["Diazonium salts", "Initial decomposition temperatures", "Secondary amines", "Structure stability", "Triazenes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085705999", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"56945497900": {"Name": "Schotten C.", "AuthorID": "56945497900", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Leeds"}, "57217006019": {"Name": "Leprevost S.K.", "AuthorID": "57217006019", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff University, Main Building"}, "57217010924": {"Name": "Yong L.M.", "AuthorID": "57217010924", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff University, Main Building"}, "55420405800": {"Name": "Hughes C.E.", "AuthorID": "55420405800", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff University, Main Building"}, "57203486964": {"Name": "Harris K.D.M.", "AuthorID": "57203486964", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff University, Main Building"}, "23018311500": {"Name": "Browne D.L.", "AuthorID": "23018311500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University College London"}}}
