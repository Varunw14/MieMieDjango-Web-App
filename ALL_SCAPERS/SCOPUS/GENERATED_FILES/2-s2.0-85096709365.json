To this end, the design of environmental and energy policies should be accompanied by an interdisciplinary analysis that includes potential effects on distinct groups of society (defined by income, age, or location), regions, and sectors. This work synthesizes common modeling frameworks used to assess technical, socio-economic, and environmental aspects in policy analysis and the recent progress to portray distributional impacts in each of them. Furthermore, the main indicators produced by each method are highlighted and a critical review pointing to gaps and limitations that could be addressed by future research is presented.", "AuthorKeywords": ["distributional impacts", "energy policies", "energy system modeling", "environmental impacts", "general equilibrium modeling", "micro-simulation", "model coupling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Critical review", "Environmental aspects", "Interdisciplinary analysis", "Model framework", "Policy analysis", "Potential effects", "Recent progress", "Socio-economics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096709365", "SubjectAreas": [["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"]], "AuthorData": {"57190817896": {"Name": "Montenegro R.C.", "AuthorID": "57190817896", "AffiliationID": "60015815", "AffiliationName": "IER Institute of Energy Economics and the Rational Energy Use, University of Stuttgart"}, "55595554800": {"Name": "Dobbins A.H.", "AuthorID": "55595554800", "AffiliationID": "60015815", "AffiliationName": "IER Institute of Energy Economics and the Rational Energy Use, University of Stuttgart"}, "56212537800": {"Name": "Schmid D.", "AuthorID": "56212537800", "AffiliationID": "60015815", "AffiliationName": "IER Institute of Energy Economics and the Rational Energy Use, University of Stuttgart"}, "6603053903": {"Name": "Fahl U.", "AuthorID": "6603053903", "AffiliationID": "60015815", "AffiliationName": "IER Institute of Energy Economics and the Rational Energy Use, University of Stuttgart"}, "55549666800": {"Name": "Fragkos P.", "AuthorID": "55549666800", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "E3Modelling"}, "36792192100": {"Name": "Pye S.", "AuthorID": "36792192100", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute, University College London (UCL)"}}}
