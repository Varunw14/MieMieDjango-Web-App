However, limitations on the quality of the final implants are present; thus, investigations are needed to ensure adequate quality and patients safety. X-ray microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) has been recognised to be the most suitable method to evaluate the complexity of 3D-printed parts. The purpose of this study was to assess the reliability of a micro-CT analysis method comparing it with reference systems, such as coordinate measuring machine and electron microscopy. Design/methodology/approach: 3D-printed acetabular components for hip arthroplasty (n = 2) were investigated. Dimensions related to the dense and porous regions of the samples were measured. The micro-CT scanning parameters (voltage \u2013 kV, current \u2013 \u00b5A) were optimised selecting six combinations of beam voltage and current. Findings: Micro-CT showed good correlation and agreement with both coordinate measuring machine and scanning electron microscopy when optimal scanning parameters were selected (130 kV \u2013 100 \u00b5A to 180 kV \u2013 80 \u00b5A). Mean discrepancies of 50 \u00b5m (\u00b1 300) and 20 \u00b5m (\u00b1 60) were found between the techniques for dense and porous dimensions. Investigation method such as micro-CT imaging may help to better understand the impact of 3D printing manufacturing technology on the properties of orthopaedic implants. Originality/value: The optimisation of the scanning parameters and the validation of this method with reference techniques may guide further analysis of similar orthopaedic components.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D printing", "Acetabular cups", "Additive manufacturing", "Hip arthroplasty", "Microcomputed tomography", "Orthopaedic implants"], "IndexKeywords": ["3-D printing", "Acetabular cup", "Hip arthroplasties", "Microcomputed tomography", "Orthopaedic implants"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078586047", "SubjectAreas": [["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"57210640401": {"Name": "Dall\u2019Ava L.", "AuthorID": "57210640401", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London"}, "57204899818": {"Name": "Bergiers S.", "AuthorID": "57204899818", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London"}, "6506962865": {"Name": "Hothi H.", "AuthorID": "6506962865", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "56089319500": {"Name": "Henckel J.", "AuthorID": "56089319500", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "56974476700": {"Name": "Di Laura A.", "AuthorID": "56974476700", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "24597673100": {"Name": "Hart A.", "AuthorID": "24597673100", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
