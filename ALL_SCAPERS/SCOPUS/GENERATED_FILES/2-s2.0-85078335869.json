The ketogenic diet supplies an alternative cerebral metabolic fuel, with potential neuroprotective effects. Our goal was to compare the effects of a modified Mediterranean-ketogenic diet (MMKD) and an American Heart Association Diet (AHAD) on cerebrospinal fluid Alzheimer's biomarkers, neuroimaging measures, peripheral metabolism, and cognition in older adults at risk for Alzheimer's. Twenty participants with subjective memory complaints (n = 11) or mild cognitive impairment (n = 9) completed both diets, with 3 participants discontinuing early. Mean compliance rates were 90% for MMKD and 95% for AHAD. All participants had improved metabolic indices following MMKD. MMKD was associated with increased cerebrospinal fluid A\u03b242 and decreased tau. There was increased cerebral perfusion and increased cerebral ketone body uptake (11C-acetoacetate PET, in subsample) following MMKD. Memory performance improved after both diets, which may be due to practice effects. Our results suggest that a ketogenic intervention targeted toward adults at risk for Alzheimer's may prove beneficial in the prevention of cognitive decline.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "CSF biomarkers", "Ketogenic diet", "Mild cognitive impairment", "MRI", "PET"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Biomarkers", "Cerebrovascular Circulation", "Cross-Over Studies", "Diet, Mediterranean", "Female", "Humans", "Ketone Bodies", "Male", "Memory", "Middle Aged", "Peptide Fragments", "Pilot Projects", "Risk"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078335869", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"39561290400": {"Name": "Neth B.J.", "AuthorID": "39561290400", "AffiliationID": "60005558", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic"}, "57200598310": {"Name": "Kellar D.", "AuthorID": "57200598310", "AffiliationID": "60031437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Wake Forest School of Medicine"}, "55147825800": {"Name": "Lockhart S.N.", "AuthorID": "55147825800", "AffiliationID": "60031437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Wake Forest School of Medicine"}, "12139793200": {"Name": "Hoscheidt S.", "AuthorID": "12139793200", "AffiliationID": "60031437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Wake Forest School of Medicine"}, "7007034447": {"Name": "Craft S.", "AuthorID": "7007034447", "AffiliationID": "60031437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Wake Forest School of Medicine"}, "7003564242": {"Name": "Mintz A.", "AuthorID": "7003564242", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Columbia University"}, "6701786061": {"Name": "Whitlow C.", "AuthorID": "6701786061", "AffiliationID": "60031437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Wake Forest School of Medicine"}, "7402506479": {"Name": "Jung Y.", "AuthorID": "7402506479", "AffiliationID": "60031437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Wake Forest School of Medicine"}, "55343037800": {"Name": "Solingapuram Sai K.", "AuthorID": "55343037800", "AffiliationID": "60031437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Wake Forest School of Medicine"}, "7003284184": {"Name": "Maldjian J.", "AuthorID": "7003284184", "AffiliationID": "60026695, 60014739", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center"}, "7003765031": {"Name": "Register T.C.", "AuthorID": "7003765031", "AffiliationID": "60031437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology - Comparative Medicine, Wake Forest School of Medicine"}, "36463576300": {"Name": "Heslegrave A.J.", "AuthorID": "36463576300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL"}, "57208899083": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "57208899083", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "7101909602": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "7101909602", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "7102460295": {"Name": "Cunnane S.C.", "AuthorID": "7102460295", "AffiliationID": "60011832", "AffiliationName": "Research Centre on Aging, Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke"}, "34874640300": {"Name": "Castellano C.A.", "AuthorID": "34874640300", "AffiliationID": "60011832", "AffiliationName": "Research Centre on Aging, Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke"}}}
