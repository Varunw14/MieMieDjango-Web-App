The data reported here is to accompany a co-submitted manuscript (10.1016/j.matdes.2020.108585 [1]) which compares two well-known X-ray attenuation data sources: Henke et al. and Hubbell et al., and applies methodology reported by Reiter et al. to extend this data towards the practical characterisation of prominent cathode materials. This data may be used to extend beyond the analysis reported in the accompanying manuscript, and may aid in the applications for other materials, not limited to Li-ion batteries.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Batteries, Engineering", "Materials science", "Synchrotron radiation", "X-ray", "X-ray computed tomography", "X-ray imaging", "X-ray physics"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083861462", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57044825000": {"Name": "Heenan T.M.M.", "AuthorID": "57044825000", "AffiliationID": "60172680", "AffiliationName": "The Faraday Institution, Quad One, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "57191663553": {"Name": "Tan C.", "AuthorID": "57191663553", "AffiliationID": "60172680", "AffiliationName": "The Faraday Institution, Quad One, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "57215419425": {"Name": "Wade A.J.", "AuthorID": "57215419425", "AffiliationID": "60172680", "AffiliationName": "The Faraday Institution, Quad One, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "56110123700": {"Name": "Jervis R.", "AuthorID": "56110123700", "AffiliationID": "60172680", "AffiliationName": "The Faraday Institution, Quad One, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.J.L.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60172680", "AffiliationName": "The Faraday Institution, Quad One, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.R.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60172680", "AffiliationName": "The Faraday Institution, Quad One, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}}}
