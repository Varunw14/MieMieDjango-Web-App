Published by BMJ.Objectives Large differences exist in the burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) between Russia and Western European countries including Norway. Obesity prevalence may contribute to the differences. We investigated whether difference in the level of adiposity, assessed using body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio(WHR), could explain intercountry differences in the burden of carotid plaque, a measure of atherosclerosis, in the populations. Design Cross-sectional analysis. Logistic and linear regression models were used. Setting We used population-based cross-sectional Know Your Heart (KYH) study in Russia and the Troms\u00f8 7 study (Troms\u00f8 7) in Norway. Participants 3262 and 1800 men and women aged 40-69 years in KYH and Troms\u00f8 7, respectively. Primary and secondary outcome The presence of carotid plaques and plaque score assessed using ultrasound. Results The presence of carotid plaques and plaque score were higher in KYH than Troms\u00f8 7 regardless of age group and sex. A positive association between carotid plaque burden and adiposity was found (OR of having at least one plaque per SD in WHR 1.18 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.31) for men; 1.15 (1.06 to 1.25) for women)) adjusted for age, smoking and education in a pooled analysis of the two studies. There was little evidence of the interaction between study and adiposity. These effects did not differ between the two studies. However, neither adiposity nor CVD risk factors (smoking, systolic blood pressure, cholesterol, glycosylated haemoglobin) explained the higher carotid plaque burden in KYH compared with Troms\u00f8 7. Conclusion Adiposity, especially abdominal adiposity, is a risk factor for carotid plaque in Russia and Norway, although neither adiposity nor established CVD risk factors explained the higher plaque burden in Russia. To reduce the CVD burden in Russia, beyond prevention and treatment of adiposity, further research is required to understand why Russia has a high burden of atherosclerosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardiac epidemiology", "Epidemiology", "Vascular medicine"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084384253", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57201653188": {"Name": "Imahori Y.", "AuthorID": "57201653188", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7101816884": {"Name": "Frost C.", "AuthorID": "7101816884", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "20434253200": {"Name": "Leon D.A.", "AuthorID": "20434253200", "AffiliationID": "60021255", "AffiliationName": "UiT the Arctic University of Norway"}, "55768482800": {"Name": "Mathiesen E.B.", "AuthorID": "55768482800", "AffiliationID": "60021255", "AffiliationName": "UiT the Arctic University of Norway"}, "23485404100": {"Name": "Hopstock L.A.", "AuthorID": "23485404100", "AffiliationID": "60021255", "AffiliationName": "UiT the Arctic University of Norway"}, "6602252604": {"Name": "Ryabikov A.", "AuthorID": "6602252604", "AffiliationID": "60069084", "AffiliationName": "Novosibirsk State Medical University"}, "6603876724": {"Name": "Malyutina S.", "AuthorID": "6603876724", "AffiliationID": "60069084", "AffiliationName": "Novosibirsk State Medical University"}, "55345249700": {"Name": "Kudryavtsev A.V.", "AuthorID": "55345249700", "AffiliationID": "60025420", "AffiliationName": "Northern State Medical University"}, "57207779861": {"Name": "Kornev M.", "AuthorID": "57207779861", "AffiliationID": "60025420", "AffiliationName": "Northern State Medical University"}, "57207789660": {"Name": "Hughes A.D.", "AuthorID": "57207789660", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
