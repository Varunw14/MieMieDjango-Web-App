These attributes endow cancer cells with the ability to survive stressors of the tumor microenvironment and enable them to landscape and exploit the host terrain, thereby facilitating cancer progression and therapy resistance. Understanding the molecular and physiological principles of cancer metabolism is one of the key prerequisites for the development of better anticancer treatments. Therefore, various aspects of cancer metabolism were addressed at the 5th annual meeting of the International Society of Cancer Metabolism (ISCaM) in Bratislava, Slovakia, on October 17\u201320, 2018. The meeting presentations and discussions were traditionally focused on mechanistic, translational, and clinical characteristics of metabolism and pH control in cancer, at the level of molecular pathways, cells, tissues, and organisms. In order to reflect major healthcare challenges of the current era, ISCaM has extended its scope to metabolic disorders contributing to cancer, as well as to opportunities for their prevention, intervention, and therapeutic targeting.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cancer imaging", "cancer metabolism", "cancer therapy", "proton dynamics", "tumor microenvironment"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076931701", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"6507975142": {"Name": "Avnet S.", "AuthorID": "6507975142", "AffiliationID": "60029091", "AffiliationName": "Orthopaedic Pathophysiology and Regenerative Medicine Unit, IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli"}, "7006625138": {"Name": "Baldini N.", "AuthorID": "7006625138", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna"}, "42460903600": {"Name": "Brisson L.", "AuthorID": "42460903600", "AffiliationID": "60032530, 60158102", "AffiliationName": "INSERM UMR1069, Nutrition, Croissance et Cancer, University of Tours"}, "7401502456": {"Name": "Pedersen S.F.", "AuthorID": "7401502456", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Copenhagen"}, "6506436390": {"Name": "Porporato P.E.", "AuthorID": "6506436390", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Science, Molecular Biotechnology Center, University of Torino"}, "6602926701": {"Name": "Sonveaux P.", "AuthorID": "6602926701", "AffiliationID": "60000874", "AffiliationName": "Pole of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Institut de Recherche Exp\u00e9rimentale et Clinique, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain"}, "6602576918": {"Name": "Szabadkai G.", "AuthorID": "6602576918", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "The Francis Crick Institute"}, "7003968078": {"Name": "Pastorekova S.", "AuthorID": "7003968078", "AffiliationID": "60010330", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Center, Slovak Academy of Sciences"}}}
