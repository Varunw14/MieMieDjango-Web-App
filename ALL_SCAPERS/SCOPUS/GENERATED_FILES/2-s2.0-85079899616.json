The paper gives conditions under which, with probability approaching 1 as the sample size increases, penalized maximum likelihood (PML) estimation with the adaptive LASSO (AL) penalty distinguishes correctly between zero and non-zero parameters. The paper also gives conditions under which PML reduces the asymptotic mean-square estimation error of any continuously differentiable function of the model's parameters. The paper describes a method for computing PML estimates and presents the results of Monte Carlo experiments that illustrate their performance. It also presents the results of PML estimation of a random coefficients logit model of choice among brands of butter and margarine in the British groceries market.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adaptive LASSO", "Logit model", "Penalized estimation", "Random coefficients"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptive lassos", "Continuously differentiable", "Logit modeling", "Monte Carlo experiments", "Multinomial logit model", "Penalized estimation", "Penalized maximum likelihood", "Random coefficients"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079899616", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"7201833855": {"Name": "Horowitz J.L.", "AuthorID": "7201833855", "AffiliationID": "60007363", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, Northwestern University"}, "56840582100": {"Name": "Nesheim L.", "AuthorID": "56840582100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60117041, 60012327", "AffiliationName": "CeMMAP, University College London, Institute for Fiscal Studies"}}}
