Habal, MD.OBJECTIVES: To: (1) design an artifact-free 3D-printed MR-safe temporary transfer device, (2) engineer bone-pins from carbon fiber reinforced polyether ether ketone (CFR-PEEK), (3) evaluate the imaging artifacts of CFR-PEEK, and (4) confirm the osteointegration potential of CFR-PEEK, thus enhancing 3D-planning of bony advancements in hemifacial microsomia using sequential magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). STUDY DESIGN: Engineered CRF-PEEK bone pins and a 3D printed ex-fix device were implanted into a sheep head and imaged with MRI and computed tomography . The osseointegration and bony compatibility potential of CFR-PEEK was assessed with scanning electron microscopy images of MC3T3 preosteoblast cells on the surface of the material. RESULTS: The CFR-PEEK pins resulted in a signal void equivalent to the dimension of the pin, with no adjacent areas of MR-signal loss or computed tomography artifact. MCT3 cells adhered and proliferated on the surface of the discs by forming a monolayer of cells, confirming compatibility and osseointegration potential. CONCLUSION: A 3D printed transfer device could be utilized temporarily during MRI to permit artifact-free 3D planning. CFR-PEEK pins eliminate imaging artifact permitting sequential MRI examination. In combination, this has the potential to enhance distraction osteogenesis, by permitting accurate three-dimensional planning without ionizing radiation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85099324947", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"]], "AuthorData": {"25648955800": {"Name": "Eley K.A.", "AuthorID": "25648955800", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University of Cambridge"}, "14022727600": {"Name": "Delso G.", "AuthorID": "14022727600", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University of Cambridge"}, "37039482400": {"Name": "Kaggie J.", "AuthorID": "37039482400", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University of Cambridge"}, "24173602100": {"Name": "Moazen M.", "AuthorID": "24173602100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "57221505242": {"Name": "Javidan M.", "AuthorID": "57221505242", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "24070966200": {"Name": "Kalaskar D.M.", "AuthorID": "24070966200", "AffiliationID": "125640078", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Sciences, UCL Institute of Orthopedics and Musculoskeletal Sciences"}, "57221503442": {"Name": "Knowles J.C.", "AuthorID": "57221503442", "AffiliationID": "60002877", "AffiliationName": "UCL Eastman-Korea Dental Medicine Innovation Centre, Dankook University"}, "57195976712": {"Name": "Owji N.", "AuthorID": "57195976712", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "6602500532": {"Name": "Watt-Smith S.R.", "AuthorID": "6602500532", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}}}
