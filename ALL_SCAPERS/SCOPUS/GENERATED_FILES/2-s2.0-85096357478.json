MarSEVR is part of the Safe Oceans concept, a green ocean technology that integrates several VR safety training applications to reduce maritime accidents that result into human casualties, sea pollution and other environmental damages. The paper indicates the research delivery architecture driven by Hevner's design science in information systems Research for usability, use experience (UX) and effectiveness. Furthermore, this technology integration is approached from a game design perspective for user engagement but also from a cognitive and neuroscience perspective for pedagogical use and purposes. The paper addressees the impact of the eye tracking technology in the maritime sector operations, training market, and competitive research. Lastly areas of further research are presented and the efforts to link and align finger tracking and hand recognitions technologies with eye tracking for a more complete VR training environment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cognitive Science", "Eye tracking", "Maritime safety training", "Neuroscience", "Shipping", "Virtual Reality", "Virtual training"], "IndexKeywords": ["Delivery architecture", "Environmental damage", "Eye tracking technologies", "Maritime accidents", "Maritime safety", "Pedagogical use", "Safety training", "Technology Integration"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096357478", "SubjectAreas": [["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Information Systems and Management", "DECI", "1802"], ["Media Technology", "ENGI", "2214"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"17435411000": {"Name": "Luimula M.", "AuthorID": "17435411000", "AffiliationID": "60098990", "AffiliationName": "Turku University of Applied Sciences"}, "8654046600": {"Name": "Markopoulos E.", "AuthorID": "8654046600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57219973233": {"Name": "Laivuori N.", "AuthorID": "57219973233", "AffiliationID": "60098990", "AffiliationName": "Turku University of Applied Sciences"}, "57191280111": {"Name": "Ravyse W.", "AuthorID": "57191280111", "AffiliationID": "60098990", "AffiliationName": "Turku University of Applied Sciences"}, "55917360500": {"Name": "Kaakinen J.K.", "AuthorID": "55917360500", "AffiliationID": "60006876", "AffiliationName": "University of Turku"}, "57209743847": {"Name": "Markopoulos P.", "AuthorID": "57209743847", "AffiliationID": "60021764", "AffiliationName": "University of the Arts London"}}}
