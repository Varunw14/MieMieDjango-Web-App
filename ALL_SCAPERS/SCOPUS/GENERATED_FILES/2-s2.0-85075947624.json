The tutorial will present the concept of the learning health system and give participants an opportunity to consider a range of typical problems involved in managing healthcare organisations and to reflect on the different forms of data and analytical methods that can be used to identify improvements. These will be discussed in the context of recent LHS projects from the UK such as Connected Health Cities. The tutorial leads will present examples of approaches to identify outliers, to predicting demand, to measuring flow, and to stratifying populations. They will illustrate how initiatives to collect, share and link electronic health data support can support these aims. Finally the tutorial will explore the practical challenges involves in trying to move from analysis to impact. Intended Audience The tutorial is aimed at a those interested in learning about the challenges faced in implementing learning health systems, with a focus on practical problems associated with access to data, data quality, choice of analytical approach and implementing change.
