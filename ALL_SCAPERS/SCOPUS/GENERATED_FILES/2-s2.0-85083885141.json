A total of eighty-eight well-dated sherds including dark-burnished and graphite-painted pottery that originate across this period have been analysed using a multi-pronged scientific approach in order to reconstruct the raw materials and firing conditions that were necessary for the production of these decorative styles. This is then compared to the pyrotechnological requirements and chronology of copper smelting in order to shed new light on the assumed, yet rarely investigated, hypothesis that advances in pottery firing technology in the late 6th and early 5th millennia BC Balkans were an important precursor for the emergence of metallurgy in this region at around 5000 BC. The results of this study and the recent literature indicate that the ability to exert sufficiently close control over the redox atmosphere in a two-step firing process necessary to produce graphite-painted pottery could indeed link these two crafts. However, graphite-painted pottery and metallurgy emerge at around the same time, both benefitting from the pre-existing experience with dark-burnished pottery and an increasing focus on aesthetics and exotic minerals. Thus, they appear as related technologies, but not as one being the precursor to the other.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ceramic technology", "Dark-burnished pottery", "Early metallurgy", "Graphite decoration", "Late Neolithic", "Pyrotechnology", "Vin\u010da culture"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083885141", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"57203287865": {"Name": "Amicone S.", "AuthorID": "57203287865", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "7005748174": {"Name": "Berthold C.", "AuthorID": "7005748174", "AffiliationID": "60017246", "AffiliationName": "Competence Center Archaeometry Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Eberhard-Karls-Universit\u00e4t T\u00fcbingen"}, "36169346800": {"Name": "Radivojevi\u0107 M.", "AuthorID": "36169346800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "22953938100": {"Name": "Quinn P.S.", "AuthorID": "22953938100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "57202699283": {"Name": "Rehren T.", "AuthorID": "57202699283", "AffiliationID": "119119308", "AffiliationName": "The Cyprus Institute"}}}
