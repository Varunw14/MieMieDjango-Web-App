The optical and structural properties of zinc-phthalocyanine have been studied extensively previously. Here we report we have fabricated the nanowires of zinc-phthalocyanines (the \u03b7-phase) and investigated their crystal structures and optical properties. The in-situ x-ray-diffraction experiments show that zinc-phthalocyanine nanowires grown at the low-temperature region have a distinct crystal structure as compared with the zinc-phthalocyanine polymorphs reported previously. We have also fitted the x-ray diffraction data and obtained the crystal-structure parameters, which further suggests that the nanowire phase has a new crystal structure. The UV\u2013Vis experiments suggest similar qualitative feature in both the Q-band and the B-band, but slightly different quantitative perspectives. As explained by using the first-principles calculations, a mixture of intra-molecular and charge-transfer excitations can account for the splitting of the Q-band. Our work can provide a solid foundation for the further applications of zinc-phthalocyanines in organic optoelectronics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Crystal structure", "Nanowires", "Optical and structural properties", "Time-dependent Density-functional theory", "Zinc-phthalocyanine"], "IndexKeywords": ["Charge-transfer excitations", "First-principles calculation", "In-situ X-ray diffraction", "Low temperature regions", "Organic optoelectronics", "Qualitative features", "X-ray diffraction data", "Zinc phthalocyanines"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087382410", "SubjectAreas": [["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57189464615": {"Name": "Guo T.", "AuthorID": "57189464615", "AffiliationID": "60084628", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Yunnan Provincial Higher Education Institutions for Organic Optoelectronic Materials and Devices, Kunming University'"}, "56915382000": {"Name": "Zou T.", "AuthorID": "56915382000", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School"}, "57201363341": {"Name": "Shi P.", "AuthorID": "57201363341", "AffiliationID": "60028009", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials and Energy, Yunnan University"}, "57217171916": {"Name": "Song Y.", "AuthorID": "57217171916", "AffiliationID": "60084628", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Yunnan Provincial Higher Education Institutions for Organic Optoelectronic Materials and Devices, Kunming University'"}, "57217590755": {"Name": "Wu M.", "AuthorID": "57217590755", "AffiliationID": "60084628", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Yunnan Provincial Higher Education Institutions for Organic Optoelectronic Materials and Devices, Kunming University'"}, "57217597001": {"Name": "Xiao F.", "AuthorID": "57217597001", "AffiliationID": "60084628", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Yunnan Provincial Higher Education Institutions for Organic Optoelectronic Materials and Devices, Kunming University'"}, "56092126900": {"Name": "Wang H.", "AuthorID": "56092126900", "AffiliationID": "60084628", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Yunnan Provincial Higher Education Institutions for Organic Optoelectronic Materials and Devices, Kunming University'"}, "57217590084": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "57217590084", "AffiliationID": "60028009", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials and Energy, Yunnan University"}, "57192650480": {"Name": "Wu W.", "AuthorID": "57192650480", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Department of Physics and Astronomy and London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}}}
