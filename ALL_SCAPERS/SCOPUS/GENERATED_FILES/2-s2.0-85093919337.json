Here, the authors present the first archaeological evidence for intentional facial mutilation from Anglo-Saxon England-comprising the removal of the nose, upper lip and possible scalping-inflicted upon a young adult female. The injuries are consistent with documented punishments for female offenders. Although such mutilations do not appear in the written record until the tenth century AD, the instance reported here suggests that the practice may have emerged a century earlier. This case is examined in the context of a wider consideration of the motivations and significance of facial disfigurement in past societies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anglo-Saxon", "Britain", "facial mutilation", "law codes", "palaeopathology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85093919337", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"], ["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"]], "AuthorData": {"36695779800": {"Name": "Cole G.", "AuthorID": "36695779800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "36052112300": {"Name": "Reynolds A.", "AuthorID": "36052112300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "7006429404": {"Name": "Waldron T.", "AuthorID": "7006429404", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "55905037700": {"Name": "Ditchfield P.W.", "AuthorID": "55905037700", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Research Laboratory for Archaeology, School of Archaeology, University of Oxford"}, "7403062043": {"Name": "Edwards C.J.", "AuthorID": "7403062043", "AffiliationID": "60032343", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological and Geographical Sciences, University of Huddersfield"}, "57191965053": {"Name": "Dulias K.", "AuthorID": "57191965053", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology, University of York"}}}
