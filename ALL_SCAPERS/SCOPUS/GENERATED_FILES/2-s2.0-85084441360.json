These models are however computationally taxing when dealing with large samples. Here, in an effort to reduce the computational burden, we present a means of synthesizing full-wave scanning-mode OCT image formation using only a single simulation of a plane wave incident on a given sample medium. The method involves an angular spectrum approach which synthesizes the signal for arbitrary scan positions, and arbitrary illumination conditions. This is demonstrated to reduce the required simulation time by an order of magnitude when synthesizing OCT B-scans, as compared to previous methods which require a separate simulation for each scan position.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electromagnetic modelling", "Microscopy", "Optical Coherence Tomography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Angular spectrum approaches", "Approximate model", "Arbitrary illuminations", "Computational burden", "Feasible alternatives", "Full waves", "Scanning mode", "Simulation time"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084441360", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"]], "AuthorData": {"37039602700": {"Name": "Macdonald C.M.", "AuthorID": "37039602700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7102012051": {"Name": "Munro P.R.T.", "AuthorID": "7102012051", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
