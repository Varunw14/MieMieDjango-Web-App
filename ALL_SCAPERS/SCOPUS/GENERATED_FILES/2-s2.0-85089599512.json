This modelling strategy yields a general class of semiparametric Markov diffusion models with parametric dynamic copulas and nonparametric marginal distributions. We provide primitive conditions for the identification of the UPD parameters together with the unknown transformations from discrete samples. Likelihood-based estimators of both parametric and nonparametric components are developed and we analyse their asymptotic properties. Kernel-based drift and diffusion estimators are also proposed and shown to be normally distributed in large samples. A simulation study investigates the finite sample performance of our estimators in the context of modelling US short-term interest rates. We also present a simple application of the proposed method for modelling the CBOE volatility index data.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diffusion process", "Dynamic copula", "Identification", "Semiparametric maximum likelihood", "Transformation model"], "IndexKeywords": ["Asymptotic properties", "Diffusion estimators", "Finite sample performance", "Marginal distribution", "Markov diffusions", "Modelling strategies", "Short-term interests", "Simulation studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089599512", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"25626321900": {"Name": "Bu R.", "AuthorID": "25626321900", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, Management School, University of Liverpool"}, "6603470453": {"Name": "Hadri K.", "AuthorID": "6603470453", "AffiliationID": "60177646, 60029738", "AffiliationName": "Queen's University Management School, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, Northern Ireland"}, "22937960200": {"Name": "Kristensen D.", "AuthorID": "22937960200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University College London"}}}
