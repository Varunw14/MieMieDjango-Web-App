We wished to determine whether greater sodium removal had adverse consequences. Methods: We calculated 24-h urinary and peritoneal sodium losses in peritoneal dialysis patients treated by automated cyclers, when attending for peritoneal membrane and bioimpedance assessments. Results: We reviewed 439 peritoneal dialysis patients, 56.7% male, average age 54.6 years, median sodium loss 110 (68\u2013155) mmol/day. Sodium loss was strongly associated with urine volume, r = 0.37, protein nitrogen appearance rate, r = 0.29, and body cell mass, r = 0.21, all p < 0.001. We found no association with blood pressure or anti-hypertensive medication prescription, or extracellular water. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, sodium loss was associated with greater urine output, odds ratio 1.001, 95% confidence interval 1.00\u20131.001, p < 0.001, and protein nitrogen appearance (odds ratio 1.023, confidence interval 1.006\u20131.04), p = 0.008. Adjusting for body weight, sodium loss was associated with urine output (odds ratio 1.001, confidence interval 1.001\u20131.002, p < 0.001), and negatively with body fat index (odds ratio 0.96, confidence interval 0.93\u20130.99, p = 0.008) and co-morbidity grade (odds ratio 0.58, confidence interval 0.36\u20130.39, p = 0.023). Conclusion: Heavier peritoneal dialysis patients with greater estimated dietary protein intake (protein nitrogen appearance), those with greater residual renal function and peritoneal clearances, along with lower co-morbidity, had greater daily sodium losses. Adjusting for body weight, then sodium losses were greater with higher daily urine output, and lower in patients with proportionately more body fat and co-morbidity. Sodium losses would appear to primarily determined by body size and not associated with hypertension or extracellular water expansion.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adequacy", "bioimpedance", "Peritoneal dialysis", "sodium", "urea", "urea clearance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Body Fat Distribution", "Dietary Proteins", "Extracellular Fluid", "Female", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Peritoneal Dialysis", "Sodium", "Urine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071415314", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"57203348814": {"Name": "Mohamed A.", "AuthorID": "57203348814", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Nephrology, Royal Free Hospital, University College London"}, "55437680000": {"Name": "Davenport A.", "AuthorID": "55437680000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Nephrology, Royal Free Hospital, University College London"}}}
