SETTING: UK-based cohort. METHODS: Pain information was collected through a pain mannikin identifying affected body sites; pain was classified as widespread if pain was reported in \u22654 of 5 body regions and in \u22657 of 15 body sites, and as regional otherwise. Sleep was assessed a median of 3.2 years later through 7-night actigraphy and through self-reported assessments of sleep quality. Chi-squared tests, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and linear/logistic regression considered associations between pain extent and sleep quality. RESULTS: Of the 414 participants, 74 (17.9%) reported widespread and 189 (45.7%) regional pain. Although there were few clear associations between actigraphy outcomes and pain extent, those with widespread and regional pain consistently reported poorer sleep quality on all self-reported measures than those with no pain. Median (interquartile range) insomnia severity index and Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) for sleep disturbance and sleep-related impairment scores were 12 (7-16), 55.3 (48.0-58.9), and 57.2 (48.9-61.3), respectively, for those with widespread pain, 8 (4-13), 51.2 (45.5-58.3), and 50.3 (43.6-56.1) for those with regional pain, and 5 (2-9), 47.9 (42.9-54.3), and 45.5 (41.4-50.3) for those with no pain (all P values 0.0001). Associations remained strong after adjustment for HIV status and other confounders, and were reduced but remained significant, after adjustment for depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Widespread pain was not associated with objective measures of sleep but was strongly associated with self-reported assessments of sleep quality in people with HIV.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089610844", "SubjectAreas": [["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57216577030": {"Name": "Sabin C.A.", "AuthorID": "57216577030", "AffiliationID": "60111140, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "Health Protection Research Unit (HPRU), National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), UCL in Partnership with Public Health England (PHE)"}, "56074756400": {"Name": "de Francesco D.", "AuthorID": "56074756400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, UCL"}, "57218573048": {"Name": "Geressu A.", "AuthorID": "57218573048", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, UCL"}, "35490718500": {"Name": "Harding R.", "AuthorID": "35490718500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Florence Nightingale Faculty, Cicely Saunders Institute, Kings College London"}, "57192375552": {"Name": "Doyle N.", "AuthorID": "57192375552", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London"}, "57210773809": {"Name": "Redline S.", "AuthorID": "57210773809", "AffiliationID": "60030058", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, MA"}, "24471642700": {"Name": "Mallon P.W.G.", "AuthorID": "24471642700", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "HIV Molecular Research Group, School of Medicine, University College Dublin"}, "57203678070": {"Name": "Post F.A.", "AuthorID": "57203678070", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Caldecot Centre, King's College Hospital"}, "7004703572": {"Name": "Boffito M.", "AuthorID": "7004703572", "AffiliationID": "60002484", "AffiliationName": "St. Stephen's Centre, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital"}, "36242445300": {"Name": "Sachikonye M.", "AuthorID": "36242445300", "AffiliationID": "60120382", "AffiliationName": "UK Community Advisory Board (UK-CAB)"}, "11638976900": {"Name": "Winston A.", "AuthorID": "11638976900", "AffiliationID": "60020413, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial Clinical Trials Unit, Imperial College London"}, "16233346800": {"Name": "Kunisaki K.M.", "AuthorID": "16233346800", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Health Care System, University of Minnesota, MN"}}}
