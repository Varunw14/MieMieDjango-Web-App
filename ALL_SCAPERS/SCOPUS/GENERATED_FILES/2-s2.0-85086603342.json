In this study, antimicrobial and immune-inflammatory activity of a synthetic EC-hepcidin1, previously identified from orange-spotted grouper, were evaluated. EC-hepcidin1 showed weak activity against the zoonotic fish pathogen Streptococcus iniae (MIC 100 \u03bcg mL\u22121 and MBC 150 \u03bcg mL\u22121). To study the effect of AMPs in general, and EC-hepcidin1 in particular, a primary cell culture (SC) from the fin tissue of the Caspian Trout (Salmo trutta caspius) was established. The neutral Red method on SC cells revealed that EC-hepcidin1 has no or very low cytotoxic properties. Treatment of cells with either EC-hepcidin1 (150 \u03bcg mL\u22121) or fish pathogen Streptococcus iniae (MOI = 10) and a mixture of both resulted in the up-regulation of gene expression of MHC-UBA, IL-6, and TNF\u03b1 indicating the modulatory function on inflammatory processes. These findings indicate that EC-hepcidin1 might act as a candidate for modulation of the innate immune system in S. iniae-based infection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["EC-hepcidin1", "Explant method", "Immune gene", "Salmo trutta caspius", "Streptococcus iniae"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086603342", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"]], "AuthorData": {"57217172495": {"Name": "Ghodsi Z.", "AuthorID": "57217172495", "AffiliationID": "60032053", "AffiliationName": "Department of Aquaculture, Marine Sciences Faculty, Tarbiat Modares University"}, "14619235700": {"Name": "Kalbassi M.R.", "AuthorID": "14619235700", "AffiliationID": "60032053", "AffiliationName": "Department of Aquaculture, Marine Sciences Faculty, Tarbiat Modares University"}, "15073867400": {"Name": "Farzaneh P.", "AuthorID": "15073867400", "AffiliationID": "60089143", "AffiliationName": "Human and Animal Cell Bank, Iranian Biological Resource Center, ACECR"}, "15019801400": {"Name": "Mobarez A.M.", "AuthorID": "15019801400", "AffiliationID": "60032053", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bacteriology, Medical Sciences Faculty, Tarbiat Modares University"}, "23487877200": {"Name": "Beemelmanns C.", "AuthorID": "23487877200", "AffiliationID": "60072518", "AffiliationName": "Leibniz Institute for Natural Product Research and Infection Biology e.V.
