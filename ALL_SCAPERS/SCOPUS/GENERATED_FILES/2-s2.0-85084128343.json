However, the precise function of LRRK2 remains unclear. We report an interaction between LRRK2 and VPS52, a subunit of the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex that identifies a function of LRRK2 in regulating membrane fusion at the trans-Golgi network (TGN). At the TGN, LRRK2 further interacts with the Golgi SNAREs VAMP4 and Syntaxin-6 and acts as a scaffolding platform that stabilizes the GARP-SNAREs complex formation. Therefore, LRRK2 influences both retrograde and post-Golgi trafficking pathways in a manner dependent on its GTP binding and kinase activity. This action is exaggerated by mutations associated with Parkinson's disease and can be blocked by kinase inhibitors. Disruption of GARP sensitizes dopamine neurons to mutant LRRK2 toxicity in C. elegans, showing that these pathways are interlinked in vivo and suggesting a link in PD.\u00a9 2020Mutations in LRRK2 are linked to Parkinson's disease. However, the cellular role of LRRK2 remains elusive. Using a combination of proteomics and imaging techniques, Beilina et al. describe a function of LRRK2 mediating endosome-TGN transport by scaffolding the GARP:Syntaxin-6 interaction, suggesting a connection between GARP and LRRK2 in Parkinson's disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["endosome", "Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2", "lysosome", "membrane trafficking", "neurodegeneration", "neurodegenerative disease", "neuroscience", "RAB29", "RAB7L1", "VPS52"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084128343", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"6507543969": {"Name": "Beilina A.", "AuthorID": "6507543969", "AffiliationID": "60017252, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health"}, "54882449200": {"Name": "Bonet-Ponce L.", "AuthorID": "54882449200", "AffiliationID": "60017252, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health"}, "21834356900": {"Name": "Kumaran R.", "AuthorID": "21834356900", "AffiliationID": "60017252, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health"}, "27467539800": {"Name": "Mamais A.", "AuthorID": "27467539800", "AffiliationID": "60017252, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health"}, "14045306800": {"Name": "Kaganovich A.", "AuthorID": "14045306800", "AffiliationID": "60017252, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health"}, "55364954000": {"Name": "Saez-Atienzar S.", "AuthorID": "55364954000", "AffiliationID": "60017252, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health"}, "57191504674": {"Name": "Roosen D.A.", "AuthorID": "57191504674", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University of Reading"}, "57191074830": {"Name": "Pellegrini L.", "AuthorID": "57191074830", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7006533543": {"Name": "Cookson M.R.", "AuthorID": "7006533543", "AffiliationID": "60017252, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health"}, "57207940948": {"Name": "Kordich J.J.", "AuthorID": "57207940948", "AffiliationID": "60027164", "AffiliationName": "Center for Neurodegenerative Science, Van Andel Research Institute"}, "7404566608": {"Name": "Moore D.J.", "AuthorID": "7404566608", "AffiliationID": "60027164", "AffiliationName": "Center for Neurodegenerative Science, Van Andel Research Institute"}, "55222231400": {"Name": "Ishida M.", "AuthorID": "55222231400", "AffiliationID": "60017777, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Cell Biology and Neurobiology Branch, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health"}, "36930406700": {"Name": "Gershlick D.C.", "AuthorID": "36930406700", "AffiliationID": "60017777, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Cell Biology and Neurobiology Branch, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health"}, "57204346948": {"Name": "Bonifacino J.S.", "AuthorID": "57204346948", "AffiliationID": "60017777, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Cell Biology and Neurobiology Branch, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health"}, "7102029918": {"Name": "Harvey K.", "AuthorID": "7102029918", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57216633296": {"Name": "Malkov V.", "AuthorID": "57216633296", "AffiliationID": "60007995", "AffiliationName": "Merck & Co., Inc."}, "35268283600": {"Name": "Fell M.J.", "AuthorID": "35268283600", "AffiliationID": "60007995", "AffiliationName": "Merck & Co., Inc."}}}
