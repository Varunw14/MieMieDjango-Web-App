A dramatic reduction in local recurrence rates and improved survival outcomes have been achieved as consequences of a better understanding of the surgical oncology of rectal cancer, and the advent of adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatments to compliment surgery have paved the way for a multidisciplinary approach to disease management. Further improvements in imaging techniques and the ability to identify prognostic factors such as tumour regression, extramural venous invasion and threatened margins have introduced the concept of decision-making based on preoperative staging information. Modern treatment strategies are underpinned by accurate high-resolution imaging guiding both neoadjuvant therapy and precision surgery, followed by meticulous pathological scrutiny identifying the important prognostic factors for adjuvant chemotherapy. Included in these strategies are organ-sparing approaches and watch-and-wait strategies in selected patients. These pathways rely on the close working of interlinked disciplines within a multidisciplinary team. Such multidisciplinary forums are becoming standard in the treatment of rectal cancer across the UK, Europe and, more recently, the USA. This Review examines the essential components of modern-day management of rectal cancer through a multidisciplinary team approach, providing information that is essential for any practising colorectal surgeon to guide the best patient care.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Laparoscopy", "Patient Care Team", "Proctectomy", "Rectal Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081890250", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"55559681100": {"Name": "Keller D.S.", "AuthorID": "55559681100", "AffiliationID": "60027565", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, New York-Presbyterian, Columbia University Medical Centre"}, "6701718273": {"Name": "Berho M.", "AuthorID": "6701718273", "AffiliationID": "60029770", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic Florida"}, "7402543779": {"Name": "Perez R.O.", "AuthorID": "7402543779", "AffiliationID": "118495071", "AffiliationName": "Angelita & Joaquim Institute"}, "57212920893": {"Name": "Wexner S.D.", "AuthorID": "57212920893", "AffiliationID": "60029770", "AffiliationName": "Department of Colorectal Surgery, Cleveland Clinic Florida"}, "35609458500": {"Name": "Chand M.", "AuthorID": "35609458500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences (WEISS); University College London"}}}
