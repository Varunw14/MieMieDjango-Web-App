With a mortality rate estimated to be as high as 90% and with very few able to access treatment in its active phase, very little is understood about the disease. This retrospective review of patients treated by Facing Africa for deformity and functional impairment secondary to noma between May 2015 and 2019 highlights some of the difficulties encountered by those afflicted. Eighty new patients with historical noma defects were identified and were seen over the course of nine surgical missions, with notes providing valuable geographical, socioeconomic, and psychosocial information. The mean self-reported age of onset was 5 years and 8 months, with a median time of 18 years from onset to accessing treatment. Before intervention, 65% covered their face in public, 59% reported difficulty eating, 81% were unhappy with their appearance, and 71% experienced bullying. We aimed at emphasizing the significant burden, both psychologically and physically of noma, demonstrating the disparity between recent decades of progress in the well-being of Ethiopians in general and the access to health care and mental health support for some of those most in need.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age of Onset", "Body Dissatisfaction", "Bullying", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Communication", "Drinking Water", "Eating", "Ethiopia", "Female", "Health Services Accessibility", "Humans", "Male", "Medical Missions", "Noma", "Poverty", "Quality of Life", "Reconstructive Surgical Procedures", "Risk Factors", "Severity of Illness Index", "Water Supply", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089171367", "SubjectAreas": [["Parasitology", "IMMU", "2405"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57192081135": {"Name": "Rickart A.J.", "AuthorID": "57192081135", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Great Ormond Street NHS Foundation Trust"}, "49964423600": {"Name": "Rodgers W.", "AuthorID": "49964423600", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "55893168800": {"Name": "Mizen K.", "AuthorID": "55893168800", "AffiliationID": "60005954", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "57207517147": {"Name": "Merrick G.", "AuthorID": "57207517147", "AffiliationID": "60160410", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57203151435": {"Name": "Wilson P.", "AuthorID": "57203151435", "AffiliationID": "60027676", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic Surgery, North Bristol NHS Trust"}, "57218435799": {"Name": "Nishikawa H.", "AuthorID": "57218435799", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic Surgery, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7003742514": {"Name": "Dunaway D.J.", "AuthorID": "7003742514", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic Surgery, Great Ormond Street NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
