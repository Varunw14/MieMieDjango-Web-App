This study aims to evaluate the willingness and ability to change as constructs of employee attitude toward change, assess their predictors and develop an approach to analyzing willingness and ability to change. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses an abductive approach, building on the refinement of existing theories. The authors conducted 306 employees' surveys and nine interviews to collect primary data. Findings: The result of this study suggests that the employees are willing to change when they have a sense of perceived control based on collaboration with management. Factors that have an impact on the willingness and ability to change include job function, age, years of job experience, knowledge of values, company background, understanding the current challenges, understating the urgency for change, positive attitude toward past changes and trust in leadership. Research limitations/implications: This is research is focused on one organization, and research in other industries or firms in the digital service industry would be beneficial. Practical implications: This research contributes to the practice on the conduct of diagnostic investigation in an organization's readiness and risk for a planned change. The authors add to the existing literature the new dimensions related to the prior experience with change and understanding the need and urgency for change -specific factors that are relevant to individual ability to change. Managers can use findings in this study to learn how to plan and manage organizational change in the fast-paced business environment of digital service industries. Social implications: This research will help to understand work attitudes, emotions and behaviors and therefore will improve the well-being in the organizations experiencing transformation. Originality/value: Individual readiness as a stand-alone concept was not enough explored in the literature, thus creating an opportunity for this study to fill the research gap. The lessons learned from this study are the following: ongoing change initiatives require longer time with a need to extend the organizational restructuring to behavioral and mindset change. This research suggests a practical approach to the assessment of change readiness in organizations. A simple model explaining factors affecting employees' willingness and ability to change has been suggested.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Change management", "Digital service industry", "Individual willingness and ability to change", "Organizational change"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85098288011", "SubjectAreas": [["Decision Sciences (all)", "DECI", "1800"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management", "BUSI", "1407"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"57202088661": {"Name": "Heim I.", "AuthorID": "57202088661", "AffiliationID": "60105822, 60012197", "AffiliationName": "Henley Business School, University of Reading"}, "57221122840": {"Name": "Sardar-Drenda N.", "AuthorID": "57221122840", "AffiliationID": "60105822, 60012197", "AffiliationName": "Henley Business School, University of Reading"}}}
