Neuropathology and Applied Neurobiology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British Neuropathological SocietyDeep perforator arteriopathy (DPA) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) are the commonest known cerebral small vessel diseases (CSVD), which cause ischaemic stroke, intracebral haemorrhage (ICH) and vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). While thus far mainly considered as separate entities, we here propose that DPA and CAA share similarities, overlap and interact, so that \u2018pure\u2019 DPA or CAA are extremes along a continuum of age-related small vessel pathologies. We suggest blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, endothelial damage and impaired perivascular \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) drainage are hallmark common mechanisms connecting DPA and CAA. We also suggest a need for new biomarkers (e.g. high-resolution imaging) to deepen understanding of the complex relationships between DPA and CAA.", "AuthorKeywords": ["blood-brain barrier", "cerebral amyloid angiopathy", "cerebral small vessel diseases", "deep perforator arteriopathy", "hypertensive arteriopathy", "\u03b2-amyloid drainage"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072162131", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Histology", "MEDI", "2722"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"26868119400": {"Name": "Schreiber S.", "AuthorID": "26868119400", "AffiliationID": "121400889", "AffiliationName": "Center for behavioral brain sciences (CBBS)"}, "47461772000": {"Name": "Wilisch-Neumann A.", "AuthorID": "47461772000", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) within the Helmholtz Association"}, "26868229700": {"Name": "Schreiber F.", "AuthorID": "26868229700", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) within the Helmholtz Association"}, "55750109400": {"Name": "Assmann A.", "AuthorID": "55750109400", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) within the Helmholtz Association"}, "57203980666": {"Name": "Scheumann V.", "AuthorID": "57203980666", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Otto-von-Guericke University"}, "57203992614": {"Name": "Perosa V.", "AuthorID": "57203992614", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) within the Helmholtz Association"}, "57195332333": {"Name": "Jandke S.", "AuthorID": "57195332333", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) within the Helmholtz Association"}, "56238477300": {"Name": "Mawrin C.", "AuthorID": "56238477300", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropathology, Otto-von-Guericke University"}, "23767970500": {"Name": "Carare R.O.", "AuthorID": "23767970500", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "6603707621": {"Name": "Werring D.J.", "AuthorID": "6603707621", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Research Centre, Department of Brain Repair & Rehabilitation, UCL Institute of Neurology, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
