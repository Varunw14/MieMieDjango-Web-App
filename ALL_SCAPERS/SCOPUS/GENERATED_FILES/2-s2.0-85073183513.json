The elevated presence of bromotyrosine in tissue, blood, and urine in medical conditions involving eosinophil activation has highlighted the potential role of bromotyrosine as a medical biomarker. This is highly beneficial in a paediatric setting as a urinary noninvasive biomarker. However, bromotyrosine and its derivatives may exert biological effects, such as protective effects in the brain and pathogenic effects in the thyroid. Understanding these pathways may yield therapeutic advancements in medicine. In this review, we summarize the existing evidence present in literature relating to bromotyrosine formation and metabolism, identify the biological actions of bromotyrosine and evaluate the feasibility of bromotyrosine as a medical biomarker.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bromide", "bromotyrosine", "dehalogenase", "eosinophil", "eosinophil peroxidase", "halogen", "inflammation", "myeloperoxidase", "peroxidasin", "thyroid"], "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Tyrosine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073183513", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"]], "AuthorData": {"57211262747": {"Name": "Sabir M.", "AuthorID": "57211262747", "AffiliationID": "60182839, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Division of Medicine, Royal Free Campus, University College London"}, "57211261632": {"Name": "Tan Y.Y.", "AuthorID": "57211261632", "AffiliationID": "60182839, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Division of Medicine, Royal Free Campus, University College London"}, "57211261527": {"Name": "Aris A.", "AuthorID": "57211261527", "AffiliationID": "60182839, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Division of Medicine, Royal Free Campus, University College London"}, "7101619634": {"Name": "Mani A.R.", "AuthorID": "7101619634", "AffiliationID": "60182839, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Division of Medicine, Royal Free Campus, University College London"}}}
