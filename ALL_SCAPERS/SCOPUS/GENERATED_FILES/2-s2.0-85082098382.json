The aim of this study was to explore prospective associations between disability discrimination and well-being. Design Prospective cohort study. Setting The United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study. Participants Data were from 871 individuals with a self-reported physical, cognitive or sensory disability. Primary outcome measures Depression was assessed in 2009/10. Psychological distress, mental functioning, life satisfaction and self-rated health were assessed in 2009/10 and 2013/14. Results Data were analysed using linear and logistic regression with adjustment for age, sex, household income, education, ethnicity and impairment category. Perceived disability discrimination was reported by 117 (13.4%) participants. Cross-sectionally, discrimination was associated with depression (OR=5.40, 95% CI 3.25 to 8.97) fair/poor self-rated health (OR=2.05; 95% CI 1.19 to 3.51), greater psychological distress (B=3.28, 95% CI 2.41 to 4.14), poorer mental functioning (B=-7.35; 95% CI -9.70 to -5.02) and life satisfaction (B=-1.27, 95% CI -1.66 to -0.87). Prospectively, discrimination was associated with increased psychological distress (B=2.88, 95% CI 1.39 to 4.36) and poorer mental functioning (B=-5.12; 95% CI -8.91 to -1.34), adjusting for baseline scores. Conclusions Perceived disability-related discrimination is linked with poorer well-being. These findings underscore the need for interventions to combat disability discrimination.", "AuthorKeywords": ["disability, discrimination", "mental health", "prejudice", "stigma", "well-being"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082098382", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55177075200": {"Name": "Hackett R.A.", "AuthorID": "55177075200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "7102289942": {"Name": "Steptoe A.", "AuthorID": "7102289942", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "57196323380": {"Name": "Jackson S.E.", "AuthorID": "57196323380", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "57216232083": {"Name": "Lang R.P.", "AuthorID": "57216232083", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Leonard Cheshire Research Centre, Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
