Published by Cambridge University Press for the British Institute of International and Comparative LawThis article documents how members of the European Economic Community and members of the Arab League negotiated a draft 'mega-regional' investment protection treaty from 1976 to the late 1980s\u2014the first of its kind. The negotiations produced a full draft treaty and came tantalisingly close to completion but ultimately ran into the political sands. Had it been concluded, the Convention would have been the most significant investment protection treaty ever negotiated at the time, and one of the most significant to this day. Negotiations were conducted within the cloak of diplomatic confidentiality, however, so the effort has remained unknown to even specialised scholars and practitioners to this day.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Arab League", "Euro-Arab Dialogue", "European investment policy", "Exchange controls", "Expropriation", "Freezing", "International investment law", "Investment arbitration", "Investment treaties", "Legal history", "Palestine status", "Private International Law"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083895554", "SubjectAreas": [["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"12802133500": {"Name": "Denza E.", "AuthorID": "12802133500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55659650300": {"Name": "Skovgaard Poulsen L.N.", "AuthorID": "55659650300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
