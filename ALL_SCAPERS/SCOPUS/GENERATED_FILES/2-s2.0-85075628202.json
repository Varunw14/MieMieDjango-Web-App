Hence the sensitivity of cognitive tasks and ambulatory craving measures to smoking abstinence were investigated. Methods: Cognitive tasks and ambulatory ratings of craving were assessed for sensitivity to acute abstinence (experiment 1), and nicotine replacement therapy administration (NRT) (experiment 2). Results: In experiment 1 go/no-go performance was improved (Mean Difference [MD] -0.99, 95% CI: \u22121.90 to \u22120.08) and craving was lower (Regression Coefficient [RC] \u221233.39, 95% CI: -39.96 to -26.82) in satiated compared with abstinent smokers. There was no clear evidence that N-back (MD 0.64, 95% CI: \u22120.42 to 2.51), delay discounting (MD 0.01, 95% CI: 0.001 to 0.005) or dot probe performance (MD 0.61, 95% CI: \u22120.87 to 1.54) were sensitive to acute abstinence. In experiment 2 go/no-go performance was improved (MD 1.12, 95% CI: 0.16\u20132.08) and craving was lower (RC \u221218.59, 95% CI: \u221224.63 to \u221212.55) smokers abstinent overnight receiving NRT compared with placebo. There was no clear evidence that N-back (MD \u22120.25, 95% CI: \u22121.45 to 0.94), delay discounting (MD 0.01, 95% CI: -0.002 to 0.004) or dot probe performance (MD \u22120.49, 95% CI: \u22121.61 to \u22120.64) were sensitive to NRT. Conclusions: Findings from two experiments converge to suggest that abstinence in smokers reliably increases ambulatory craving assessments and, to a lesser extent, decreases go/no-go task performance. These findings can be utilized in the development of an experimental medicine model to test novel treatments for smoking cessation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cognitive performance", "Ecological momentary assessment", "Experimental medicine model", "Smoking cessation", "Tobacco abstinence", "Tobacco withdrawal"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Craving", "Delay Discounting", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mass Screening", "Reproducibility of Results", "Smokers", "Smoking Cessation", "Task Performance and Analysis", "Temperance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075628202", "SubjectAreas": [["Toxicology", "PHAR", "3005"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57190575331": {"Name": "Grabski M.", "AuthorID": "57190575331", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychopharmacology Unit, University College London"}, "7004859481": {"Name": "Munaf\u00f2 M.R.", "AuthorID": "7004859481", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60115380", "AffiliationName": "UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies, University of Bristol"}, "7005313659": {"Name": "Curran H.V.", "AuthorID": "7005313659", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychopharmacology Unit, University College London"}, "57208068784": {"Name": "Nutt D.J.", "AuthorID": "57208068784", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Neuropsychopharmacology Unit, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "7003991675": {"Name": "Husbands S.M.", "AuthorID": "7003991675", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Bath"}, "12344685100": {"Name": "Ferguson S.G.", "AuthorID": "12344685100", "AffiliationID": "60015356", "AffiliationName": "College of Health and Medicine, University of Tasmania"}}}
