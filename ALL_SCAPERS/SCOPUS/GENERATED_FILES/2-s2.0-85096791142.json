Thus, the question of recognizing a given non-autonomous recurrence as a discrete Painlev\u00e9 equation and determining its type according to Sakai's classification scheme, understanding whether it is equivalent to some known (model) example, and especially finding an explicit change of coordinates transforming it to such an example, becomes one of the central ones. Fortunately, Sakai's geometric theory provides an almost algorithmic procedure for answering this question. In this paper we illustrate this procedure by studying an example coming from the theory of discrete orthogonal polynomials. There are many connections between orthogonal polynomials and Painlev\u00e9 equations, both differential and discrete. In particular, often the coefficients of three-term recurrence relations for discrete orthogonal polynomials can be expressed in terms of solutions of discrete Painlev\u00e9 equations. In this work we study discrete orthogonal polynomials with general hypergeometric weight and show that their recurrence coefficients satisfy, after some change of variables, the standard discrete Painlev\u00e9-V equation. We also provide an explicit change of variables transforming this equation to the standard form.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Affine Weyl groups", "Difference equations", "Discrete orthogonal polynomials", "Discrete Painlev\u00e9 equations"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096791142", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Mathematical Physics", "MATH", "2610"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"35229230200": {"Name": "Dzhamay A.", "AuthorID": "35229230200", "AffiliationID": "60016338", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Northern Colorado"}, "24537037200": {"Name": "Filipuk G.", "AuthorID": "24537037200", "AffiliationID": "60013756", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Mechanics, University of Warsaw"}, "57204706709": {"Name": "Stokes A.", "AuthorID": "57204706709", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
