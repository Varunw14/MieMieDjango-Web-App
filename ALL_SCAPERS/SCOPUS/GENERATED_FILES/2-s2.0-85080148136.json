We proceed to empirical investigation in the context of Global Food Value Chains using the tool of advanced social network analysis, which captures the raising concern that many institutional investors are passive investors in the diverse companies that are active at various segments of the chain. In view of the possible negative welfare effects of common ownership on competition and its prevalence in the food sector, it is contended that competition authorities need to develop adequate legal tools to deal with this issue and rely on economics but also other sources of wisdom (e.g. advanced social network analysis) that may enable a better mapping of the complexity of competitive interactions in this sector and be more adequate in the context of a complex economy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["agrochem", "common ownership", "concentration", "coordinated effects", "Financialization", "food value chain", "innovation", "unilateral effects", "value chain", "vertical competition"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85080148136", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)", "ECON", "2001"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"23088833500": {"Name": "Lianos I.", "AuthorID": "23088833500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Faculty of Laws"}, "57215216159": {"Name": "Velias A.", "AuthorID": "57215216159", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, City University of London"}, "57215214966": {"Name": "Katalevsky D.", "AuthorID": "57215214966", "AffiliationID": "60107804", "AffiliationName": "Russian Presidential Academy of the National Economy and Public Administration"}, "8729918600": {"Name": "Ovchinnikov G.", "AuthorID": "8729918600", "AffiliationID": "60107405", "AffiliationName": "Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology"}}}
