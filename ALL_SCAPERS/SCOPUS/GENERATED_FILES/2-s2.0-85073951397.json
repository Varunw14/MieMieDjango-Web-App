We monitored VRIs before and after transplant in children undergoing allogeneic HSCT with nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) and assessed the impact on clinical outcome. Between 2007 and 2017, 585 children underwent 620 allogeneic HSCT procedures. Out of 75 patients with a positive NPA screen (12%), transplant was delayed in 25 cases (33%), while 53 children started conditioning with a VRI. Patients undergoing HSCT with a positive NPA screen had a significantly lower overall survival (54% vs. 79%) and increased TRM (26% vs. 7%) compared to patients with a negative NPA. Patients with a positive NPA who delayed transplant and cleared the virus before conditioning had improved overall survival (90%) and lower TRM (5%). Pre-HSCT positive NPA was the only significant risk factor for progression to a lower respiratory tract infection and was a major risk factor for TRM. Transplant delay, whenever feasible, in case of a positive NPA screen for VRIs can positively impact on survival of children undergoing HSCT.", "AuthorKeywords": ["haematopoietic stem cell transplantation", "nasopharyngeal aspirate", "transplant-related mortality", "viral infections"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Disease-Free Survival", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Respiratory Tract Infections", "Retrospective Studies", "Survival Rate", "Time Factors", "Transplantation Conditioning", "Virus Diseases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073951397", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"56549688800": {"Name": "Ottaviano G.", "AuthorID": "56549688800", "AffiliationID": "60014378, 60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, University of Milano-Bicocca, San Gerardo Hospital/Fondazione MBBM"}, "7005358339": {"Name": "Lucchini G.", "AuthorID": "7005358339", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Bone Marrow Transplantation Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56079756200": {"Name": "Furtado-Silva J.M.", "AuthorID": "56079756200", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Bone Marrow Transplantation Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57209394498": {"Name": "Lazareva A.", "AuthorID": "57209394498", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Bone Marrow Transplantation Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "54906151000": {"Name": "Ciocarlie O.", "AuthorID": "54906151000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Bone Marrow Transplantation Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55645792800": {"Name": "Elfeky R.", "AuthorID": "55645792800", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Bone Marrow Transplantation Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57218180806": {"Name": "Rao K.", "AuthorID": "57218180806", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Bone Marrow Transplantation Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6602889677": {"Name": "Amrolia P.J.", "AuthorID": "6602889677", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Bone Marrow Transplantation Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57203102921": {"Name": "Veys P.", "AuthorID": "57203102921", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Bone Marrow Transplantation Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55362669500": {"Name": "Chiesa R.", "AuthorID": "55362669500", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Bone Marrow Transplantation Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55498702100": {"Name": "Breuer J.", "AuthorID": "55498702100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}}}
