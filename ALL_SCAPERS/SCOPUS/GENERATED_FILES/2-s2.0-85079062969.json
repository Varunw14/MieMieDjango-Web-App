These applications exploit the optoelectronic properties of these molecules and the ease by which such properties can be tuned by the introduction of heteroatoms and/or the addition of functional groups. We perform a high-throughput virtual screening using the xTB family of density functional tight-binding methods to map the optoelectronic property space of ~250,000 molecules. The large volume of data generated allows for a broad understanding of how the presence of heteroatoms and functional groups affect the ionisation potential, electron affinity and optical gap values of these molecular semiconductors, and how the structural features \u2013 on their own or in combination with one another \u2013 allow access to particular regions of the optoelectronic property space. Finally, we identify the apparent boundaries of the optoelectronic property space for these molecules: regions of property space that appear off limits for any small aromatic molecule.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079062969", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"]], "AuthorData": {"56516768100": {"Name": "Wilbraham L.", "AuthorID": "56516768100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57214756165": {"Name": "Smajli D.", "AuthorID": "57214756165", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57195523587": {"Name": "Heath-Apostolopoulos I.", "AuthorID": "57195523587", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6507121537": {"Name": "Zwijnenburg M.A.", "AuthorID": "6507121537", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
