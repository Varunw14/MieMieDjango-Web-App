Given the number of strata, there are hundreds of cutoffs for defining elevated and high blood pressure that make it cumbersome to use in clinical practice. This study aimed to evaluate the utility of the static cutoffs for pediatric hypertension (120/80 mm Hg for children and 130/80 mm Hg for adolescents) in determining high carotid intimamedia thickness (cIMT) in children and adolescents. Methods: Data were from 6 population-based cross-sectional studies in Brazil, China, Greece, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. A total of 4280 children and adolescents, aged 6 to 17 years, were included. High cIMT was defined as cIMT \u2265 sex-, age- and cohort-specific 90th percentile cutoffs. Results: Compared with normal blood pressure, hypertension defined using the percentile-based cutoffs from 2017 American Academy of Pediatrics guideline, and the static cutoffs were associated with similar higher odds for high cIMT (percentile-based cutoffs: odds ratio [OR], 1.46, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-1.86; static cutoffs: OR, 1.65, 95% CI, 1.25-2.17), after adjustment for sex, age, race/ethnicity, body mass index, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, triglyceride, and fasting blood glucose. The similar utility of 2 definitions in determining high cIMT was further confirmed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and net reclassification improvement methods (P for difference > 0.05). Conclusion: Static cutoffs (120/80 mm Hg for children, 130/80 mm Hg for adolescents) performed similarly compared with percentile-based cutoffs in determining high cIMT, supporting the use of static cutoffs in identifying pediatric hypertension in clinical practice.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID":
