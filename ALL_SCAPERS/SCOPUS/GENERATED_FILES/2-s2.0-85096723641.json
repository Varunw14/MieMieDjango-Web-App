Patients and Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis comparing postoperative complication and mortality rates depending on age in a consecutive series of 1890 patients who underwent RARC with ICUD for bladder cancer between 2004 and 2018 in 10 European centres. Outcomes of patients aged <80 years and those aged \u226580 years were compared with regard to postoperative complications (Clavien\u2013Dindo grading) and mortality rate. Cancer-specific mortality (CSM) and other-cause mortality (OCM) after surgery were calculated using the non-parametric Aalen-Johansen estimator. Results: A total of 1726 patients aged <80 years and 164 aged \u226580 years were included in the analysis. The 30- and 90-day rate for high-grade (Clavien\u2013Dindo grades III\u2013V) complications were 15% and 21% for patients aged <80 years compared to 11% and 13% for patients aged \u226580 years (P = 0.2 and P = 0.03), respectively. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusting for pre- and postoperative variables, age \u226580 years was not an independent predictor of high-grade complications (odds ratio 0.6, 95% confidence interval 0.3\u20131.1; P = 0.12). The non-cancer-related 90-day mortality was 2.3% for patients aged \u226580 years and 1.8% for those aged <80 years, respectively (P = 0.7). The estimated 12-month CSM and OCM rates for those aged <80 years were 8% and 3%, and for those aged \u226580 years, 15% and 8%, respectively (P = 0.009 and P < 0.001). Conclusions: The minimally invasive approach to RARC with ICUD for bladder cancer in well-selected elderly patients (aged \u226580 years) achieved a tolerable high-grade complication rate; the 90-day postoperative mortality rate was driven by cancer progression and the non-cancer-related rate was equivalent to that of patients aged <80 years. However, an increased OCM rate in this elderly group after the first year should be taken into account. These results will support clinicians and patients when balancing cancer-related vs treatment-related risks and benefits.", "AuthorKeywords": ["#BladderCancer", "#blcsm", "#EndoUrology", "#uroonc", "bladder cancer", "complication", "intracorporeal diversion", "mortality", "octogenarian", "robot-assisted radical cystectomy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096723641", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"26423984600": {"Name": "Mortezavi A.", "AuthorID": "26423984600", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet"}, "57202637068": {"Name": "R\u00f6nmark E.P.", "AuthorID": "57202637068", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Section of Urology, Karolinska Institutet"}, "35303958500": {"Name": "Wiklund P.", "AuthorID": "35303958500", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}, "7004469810": {"Name": "Hosseini A.", "AuthorID": "7004469810", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Section of Urology, Karolinska Institutet"}, "56494620800": {"Name": "Crippa A.", "AuthorID": "56494620800", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet"}, "14826635100": {"Name": "Edeling S.", "AuthorID": "14826635100", "AffiliationID": "60019370", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Vinzenzkrankenhaus Hannover"}, "6505666027": {"Name": "Pokupic S.", "AuthorID": "6505666027", "AffiliationID": "60019370", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Vinzenzkrankenhaus Hannover"}, "57191751665": {"Name": "Dell\u2019Oglio P.", "AuthorID": "57191751665", "AffiliationID": "117919155", "AffiliationName": "ORSI Academy"}, "7102168325": {"Name": "Montorsi F.", "AuthorID": "7102168325", "AffiliationID": "60082964", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Urology, Division of Oncology, Urological Research Institute, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele"}, "47060910800": {"Name": "D'Hondt F.", "AuthorID": "47060910800", "AffiliationID": "60070079", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Onze Lieve Vrouw Hospital"}, "6602157982": {"Name": "Mottrie A.", "AuthorID": "6602157982", "AffiliationID": "117919155", "AffiliationName": "ORSI Academy"}, "24176786000": {"Name": "Decaestecker K.", "AuthorID": "24176786000", "AffiliationID": "60068590", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Ghent University Hospital"}, "16204601200": {"Name": "Wijburg C.J.", "AuthorID": "16204601200", "AffiliationID": "60014983", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Rijnstate Hospital"}, "7404950765": {"Name": "Collins J.", "AuthorID": "7404950765", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "7404901815": {"Name": "Kelly J.D.", "AuthorID": "7404901815", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "57201942956": {"Name": "Tan W.S.", "AuthorID": "57201942956", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "56355040200": {"Name": "Sridhar A.", "AuthorID": "56355040200", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "12141123200": {"Name": "John H.", "AuthorID": "12141123200", "AffiliationID": "60022737", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Kantonsspital Winterthur"}, "9637696900": {"Name": "Canda A.E.", "AuthorID": "9637696900", "AffiliationID": "60006369", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, School of Medicine, Ko\u00e7 University"}, "6507429175": {"Name": "Schwentner C.", "AuthorID": "6507429175", "AffiliationID": "60009819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Diakonie Klinikum Stuttgart"}}}
