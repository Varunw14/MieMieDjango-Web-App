Methods: PD patients were recruited from movement disorder centers in an international, multicenter study. The Movement Disorder Society Nonmotor Rating Scale, consisting of 13 domains plus a subscale for nonmotor fluctuations, was rater administered, along with the Nonmotor Symptoms Scale and other clinical assessments. Standard reliability and validity testing were conducted. Results: Four hundred and two PD patients were recruited (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 67.42 \u00b1 9.96 years; mean age at PD onset \u00b1 standard deviation, 59.27 \u00b1 10.67 years; median Hoehn and Yahr stage 2 (interquartile range 2\u20133). Data quality was satisfactory for all Movement Disorder Society Nonmotor Rating Scale domains except sexual (6.7% missing data). There were no floor or ceiling effects for the Movement Disorder Society Nonmotor Rating Scale and nonmotor fluctuations total score; domains had no ceiling effects, but some floor effects (13.5%\u201383.5%). The Movement Disorder Society Nonmotor Rating Scale and nonmotor fluctuations total score internal consistency were acceptable (average Cronbach's alpha, 0.66 and 0.84, respectively); interrater reliability was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient, >0.95); for test-retest reliability, the intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.84 for the Movement Disorder Society Nonmotor Rating Scale and 0.70 for Movement Disorder Society nonmotor fluctuations total score, and precision was excellent for the Movement Disorder Society Nonmotor Rating Scale (standard error of measurement, 25.30) and fair for nonmotor fluctuations (standard error of measurement, 7.06). Correlations between Movement Disorder Society Nonmotor Rating Scale score and the corresponding Nonmotor Symptoms Scale and Movement Disorder Society UPDRS scores were high. There were no significant sex or age effects. The Movement Disorder Society Nonmotor Rating Scale score increased with increasing PD duration, disease severity, and PD medication dose (all P < 0.001). Conclusions: The Movement Disorder Society Nonmotor Rating Scale is a valid measure for measuring the burden of a wide range of Nonmotor Rating Scale scores, including nonmotor fluctuations, in PD patients. \u00a9 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.", "AuthorKeywords": ["movement disorders", "nonmotor fluctuations", "nonmotor symptoms", "Parkinson's disease", "scales"], "IndexKeywords": ["Activities of Daily Living", "Adult", "Aged", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Disability Evaluation", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Parkinson Disease", "Reproducibility of Results", "Severity of Illness Index"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073961675", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"7102516281": {"Name": "Chaudhuri K.R.", "AuthorID": "7102516281", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60029685", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Department of Neurosciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience and Parkinson Foundation Centre of Excellence, King's College Hospital"}, "54383938600": {"Name": "Rizos A.", "AuthorID": "54383938600", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60029685", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Department of Neurosciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience and Parkinson Foundation Centre of Excellence, King's College Hospital"}, "55802371059": {"Name": "Schrag A.", "AuthorID": "55802371059", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "57203216133": {"Name": "Weintraub D.", "AuthorID": "57203216133", "AffiliationID": "60014232", "AffiliationName": "Parkinson's Disease Research, Education and Clinical Center (PADRECC), Corporal Michael J.
