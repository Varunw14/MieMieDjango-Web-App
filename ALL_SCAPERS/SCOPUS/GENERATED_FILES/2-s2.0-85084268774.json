Drawing on data from 10 peer-led focus group sessions across 5 international schools, this article demonstrates how focus group discussions around moral and social values, which become more meaningful though the self-reflection provoked in encounters with different experiences and perspectives, can be advantageous for research. Peer-moderators, as both participants and facilitators, run focus groups that open dialogic spaces for exploratory talk that avoids the self-censure and deference that can emerge in the presence of an adult moderator. This is particularly important when participants are structurally disadvantaged and lack similar spaces for collaborative inquiry into their shared experiences. Video capture allows researchers in-depth access to these focus groups after the event, revealing evidentially and pedagogically rich dialogues.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dialogue", "focus groups", "moral values", "Peer-led", "power"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084268774", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"55531759100": {"Name": "Djohari N.", "AuthorID": "55531759100", "AffiliationID": "60000112, 60176145", "AffiliationName": "School of International Development, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park"}, "57213124874": {"Name": "Higham R.", "AuthorID": "57213124874", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "London Centre of Leadership in Learning, UCL Institute for Education"}}}
