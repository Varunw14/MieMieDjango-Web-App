Prospective invasive imaging studies of coronary atherosclerosis have demonstrated that invasive imaging modalities can detect lesions that are likely to progress and cause cardiovascular events and provided unique insights about atherosclerotic evolution. However, despite the undoubted value of the existing imaging techniques in clinical and research arenas, all the available modalities have significant limitations in assessing plaque characteristics when compared with histology. Hybrid/multimodality intravascular imaging appears able to overcome some of the limitations of standalone imaging; however, there are only few histology studies that examined their performance in evaluating plaque pathobiology. In this article, we review the evidence about the efficacy of standalone and multi-modality/hybrid intravascular imaging in assessing plaque morphology against histology, highlight the advantages and limitations of the existing imaging techniques and discuss the future potential of emerging imaging modalities in the study of atherosclerosis.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Coronary Artery Disease", "Endosonography", "Endovascular Procedures", "Forecasting", "Humans", "Multimodal Imaging", "Photoacoustic Techniques", "Plaque, Atherosclerotic", "Radio Waves", "Spectrometry, Fluorescence", "Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared", "Tomography, Optical Coherence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074000756", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57190865844": {"Name": "Ramasamy A.", "AuthorID": "57190865844", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University London"}, "55568508950": {"Name": "Jones D.A.", "AuthorID": "55568508950", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University London"}, "7801601121": {"Name": "Amersey R.", "AuthorID": "7801601121", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "56962775900": {"Name": "Baumbach A.", "AuthorID": "56962775900", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University London"}, "7201657327": {"Name": "Mathur A.", "AuthorID": "7201657327", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University London"}, "15822122100": {"Name": "Bourantas C.V.", "AuthorID": "15822122100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}, "34573036500": {"Name": "Serruys P.W.", "AuthorID": "34573036500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Circulatory Health, NHLI, Imperial College London"}, "56418917800": {"Name": "Johnson T.W.", "AuthorID": "56418917800", "AffiliationID": "112749235", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Heart Institute"}, "7005835193": {"Name": "Torii R.", "AuthorID": "7005835193", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "42061888600": {"Name": "Madden S.P.", "AuthorID": "42061888600", "AffiliationID": "60099502", "AffiliationName": "Infraredx Inc."}, "7003444102": {"Name": "Krams R.", "AuthorID": "7003444102", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University London"}}}
