The aim of the Promoting Independence in Dementia (PRIDE) study was to develop a postdiagnostic social intervention to help people live as well and as independently as possible. The intervention facilitates engagement in evidence-based stimulating cognitive, physical and social activities. Methods: Theories to promote adjustment to a dementia diagnosis, including theories of social learning and self-efficacy, were reviewed alongside self-management and the selective optimization model, to form the basis of the intervention. Analyses of two longitudinal databases of older adults, and qualitative analyses of interviews of older people, people with dementia, and their carers about their experiences of dementia, informed the content and focus of the intervention. Consensus expert review involving stakeholders was conducted to synthesize key components. Participants were sourced from the British NHS, voluntary services, and patient and public involvement groups. A tailored manual-based intervention was developed with the aim for this to be delivered by an intervention provider. Results: Evidence-based stimulating cognitive, physical, and social activities that have been shown to benefit people were key components of the proposed PRIDE intervention. Thirty-two participants including people with dementia (n=4), carers (n=11), dementia advisers (n=14), and older people (n=3) provided feedback on the drafts of the intervention and manual. Seven topics for activities were included (eg, \u201cmaking decisions\u201d and \u201cgetting your message across\u201d). The manual outlines delivery of the intervention over three sessions where personalized profiles and plans for up to three activities are developed, implemented, and reviewed. Conclusion: A manualized intervention was constructed based on robust methodology and found to be acceptable to participants. Consultations with stakeholders played a key role in shaping the manualized PRIDE intervention and its delivery. Unlike most social interventions for dementia, the target audience for our intervention is the people with dementia themselves.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Behavior change", "Cognitive impairment", "Manual", "Public patient involvement", "Self-management"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Psychological", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Caregivers", "Consensus", "Dementia", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Exercise", "Female", "Humans", "Independent Living", "Interviews as Topic", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Program Development", "Self Efficacy", "Social Participation", "Social Support", "Stakeholder Participation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072761554", "SubjectAreas": [["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"8664530600": {"Name": "Yates L.", "AuthorID": "8664530600", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60172395", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Mental Health, University of Nottingham"}, "7006161600": {"Name": "Orrell M.", "AuthorID": "7006161600", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60172395", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Mental Health, University of Nottingham"}, "14021176400": {"Name": "Csipke E.", "AuthorID": "14021176400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "56427480200": {"Name": "Leung P.", "AuthorID": "56427480200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "6603716658": {"Name": "Moniz-Cook E.", "AuthorID": "6603716658", "AffiliationID": "60030469", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Health and Well-Being, Faculty of Health Sciences, School of Health and Social Work, University of Hull"}, "57195247843": {"Name": "Walton H.", "AuthorID": "57195247843", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "6602617245": {"Name": "Charlesworth G.", "AuthorID": "6602617245", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "7203039292": {"Name": "Spector A.", "AuthorID": "7203039292", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "55391833400": {"Name": "Hogervorst E.", "AuthorID": "55391833400", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Sports and Exercise Medicine, Loughborough University"}, "35585839900": {"Name": "Mountain G.", "AuthorID": "35585839900", "AffiliationID": "60008524", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Applied Dementia Studies, University of Bradford"}}}
