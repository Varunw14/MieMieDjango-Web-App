All rights reserved.Following myocardial infarction (MI), the adult heart has minimal regenerative potential. Conversely, the neonatal heart can undergo extensive regeneration, and neovascularization capacity was hypothesized to contribute to this difference. Here, we demonstrate the higher angiogenic potential of neonatal compared with adult mouse cardiac endothelial cells (MCECs) in vitro and use this difference to identify candidate microRNAs (miRs) regulating cardiac angiogenesis after MI. miR expression profiling revealed miR-96 and miR-183 upregulation in adult compared with neonatal MCECs. Their overexpression decreased the angiogenic potential of neonatal MCECs in vitro and prevented scar resolution and neovascularization in neonatal mice after MI. Inversely, their inhibition improved the angiogenic potential of adult MCECs, and miR-96/miR-183\u2013KO mice had increased peri-infarct neovascularization. In silico analyses identified anillin (ANLN) as a direct target of miR-96 and miR-183. In agreement, Anln expression declined following their overexpression and increased after their inhibition in vitro. Moreover, ANLN expression inversely correlated with miR-96 expression and age in cardiac ECs of cardiovascular patients. In vivo, ANLN+ vessels were enriched in the peri-infarct area of miR-96/miR-183\u2013KO mice. These findings identify miR-96 and miR-183 as regulators of neovascularization following MI and miR-regulated genes, such as anillin, as potential therapeutic targets for cardiovascular disease.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088492273", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"56519828600": {"Name": "Castellan R.F.P.", "AuthorID": "56519828600", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57218256751": {"Name": "Vitiello M.", "AuthorID": "57218256751", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272, 60100024, 60010973", "AffiliationName": "British Heart Foundation Centre for Cardiovascular Science, Queen\u2019s Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh"}, "57216631850": {"Name": "Vidmar M.", "AuthorID": "57216631850", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272, 60100024, 60010973", "AffiliationName": "British Heart Foundation Centre for Cardiovascular Science, Queen\u2019s Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh"}, "56645017300": {"Name": "Mellis D.", "AuthorID": "56645017300", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272, 60100024, 60010973", "AffiliationName": "British Heart Foundation Centre for Cardiovascular Science, Queen\u2019s Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh"}, "57202189190": {"Name": "Cathcart B.", "AuthorID": "57202189190", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272, 60100024, 60010973", "AffiliationName": "British Heart Foundation Centre for Cardiovascular Science, Queen\u2019s Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh"}, "25637893300": {"Name": "Thomson A.", "AuthorID": "25637893300", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272, 60100024, 60010973", "AffiliationName": "British Heart Foundation Centre for Cardiovascular Science, Queen\u2019s Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh"}, "7006580760": {"Name": "Newby D.E.", "AuthorID": "7006580760", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272, 60100024, 60010973", "AffiliationName": "British Heart Foundation Centre for Cardiovascular Science, Queen\u2019s Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh"}, "7401812188": {"Name": "Gray G.A.", "AuthorID": "7401812188", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272, 60100024, 60010973", "AffiliationName": "British Heart Foundation Centre for Cardiovascular Science, Queen\u2019s Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh"}, "57203362485": {"Name": "Baker A.H.", "AuthorID": "57203362485", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272, 60100024, 60010973", "AffiliationName": "British Heart Foundation Centre for Cardiovascular Science, Queen\u2019s Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh"}, "6603715977": {"Name": "Caporali A.", "AuthorID": "6603715977", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272, 60100024, 60010973", "AffiliationName": "British Heart Foundation Centre for Cardiovascular Science, Queen\u2019s Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh"}, "57215300329": {"Name": "Meloni M.", "AuthorID": "57215300329", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272, 60100024, 60010973", "AffiliationName": "British Heart Foundation Centre for Cardiovascular Science, Queen\u2019s Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh"}, "6602149137": {"Name": "Ruhrberg C.", "AuthorID": "6602149137", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57220461903": {"Name": "Johnstone S.", "AuthorID": "57220461903", "AffiliationID": "60032768, 60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, British Heart Foundation Glasgow Cardiovascular Research Centre, University of Glasgow"}, "55972261400": {"Name": "Iacobazzi D.", "AuthorID": "55972261400", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Heart Institute, School of Clinical Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "7102895139": {"Name": "Caputo M.", "AuthorID": "7102895139", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Heart Institute, School of Clinical Sciences, University of Bristol"}}}
