A total of 15,073 patients with AMI who underwent inhospital coronary revascularization from January 2007 to December 2013 were analyzed. At 12 months, BB was significantly associated with a lower incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE, adjusted HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70\u20130.93) and all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.55\u20130.88), while ACEI/ARB was significantly associated with lower all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66\u20130.98) and heart failure (HF) hospitalization (adjusted HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.68\u20130.95). Combined BB and ACEI/ARB use was associated with the lowest incidence of MACE (adjusted HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.57\u20130.86), all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.40\u20130.77) and HF hospitalization (adjusted HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.48\u20130.86). This were consistent for left ventricular ejection fraction < 50% or \u2265 50%. In conclusion, in AMI managed with revascularization, both BB and ACEI/ARB were associated with a lower incidence of 12-month all-cause mortality. Combined BB and ACEI/ARB was associated with the lowest incidence of all-cause mortality and HF hospitalization.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acute Disease", "Adrenergic beta-Antagonists", "Aged", "Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors", "Cohort Studies", "Follow-Up Studies", "Heart Failure", "Humans", "Incidence", "Middle Aged", "Myocardial Infarction", "Percutaneous Coronary Intervention", "Postoperative Complications", "Renin-Angiotensin System", "Singapore", "Survival Analysis", "Ventricular Function, Left"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091039809", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57195632028": {"Name": "Sim H.W.", "AuthorID": "57195632028", "AffiliationID": "115008182", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital"}, "57220913382": {"Name": "Richards A.M.", "AuthorID": "57220913382", "AffiliationID": "116423649", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Research Institute"}, "7403011676": {"Name": "Tan H.C.", "AuthorID": "7403011676", "AffiliationID": "60026680, 60017161", "AffiliationName": "Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"}, "7102523113": {"Name": "Yeo T.C.", "AuthorID": "7102523113", "AffiliationID": "60026680, 60017161", "AffiliationName": "Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"}, "35215731400": {"Name": "Lee C.H.", "AuthorID": "35215731400", "AffiliationID": "116423649", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Research Institute"}, "23388249600": {"Name": "Chan M.Y.", "AuthorID": "23388249600", "AffiliationID": "116423649", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Research Institute"}, "56844093200": {"Name": "Zheng H.", "AuthorID": "56844093200", "AffiliationID": "60095107", "AffiliationName": "Health Promotion Board, National Registry of Disease Office"}, "57203726642": {"Name": "Foo L.L.", "AuthorID": "57203726642", "AffiliationID": "60095107", "AffiliationName": "Health Promotion Board, National Registry of Disease Office"}, "6602976997": {"Name": "Hausenloy D.J.", "AuthorID": "6602976997", "AffiliationID": "60072429", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Research Center, College of Medical and Health Sciences, Asia University"}, "57219013787": {"Name": "Chen R.W.", "AuthorID": "57219013787", "AffiliationID": "60002481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Tan Tock Seng Hospital"}, "7401465369": {"Name": "Ho H.H.", "AuthorID": "7401465369", "AffiliationID": "60002481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Tan Tock Seng Hospital"}, "6507365717": {"Name": "Sahlen A.", "AuthorID": "6507365717", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Karolinska Institutet"}, "16644168800": {"Name": "Yeo K.K.", "AuthorID": "16644168800", "AffiliationID": "60004409", "AffiliationName": "National Heart Centre Singapore"}, "14829599000": {"Name": "Tan J.W.", "AuthorID": "14829599000", "AffiliationID": "60004409", "AffiliationName": "National Heart Centre Singapore"}, "57217276064": {"Name": "Chua T.", "AuthorID": "57217276064", "AffiliationID": "60004409", "AffiliationName": "National Heart Centre Singapore"}, "57205155828": {"Name": "Liew B.W.", "AuthorID": "57205155828", "AffiliationID": "60013022", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Changi General Hospital"}}}
