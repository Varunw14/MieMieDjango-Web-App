Here, we report a strategy doping with a small amount of phosphorus to make inactive and low-cost spinel CuCo2O4 (CCO) turn into high-efficiency and superior to the noble metal catalyst RuO2. The spinel CuCo2O4\u2212P0.5 (CCP0.5) shows the best OER performance with a small overpotential of 290 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm\u22122 and a low Tafel slope of 68 mV dec\u22121 in an alkaline electrolyte. The phosphorus doping induces the production of an amorphous phase that provides a large number of active sites, and the synergistic effect of the crystalline phase and amorphous phase significantly improves the OER activity of CCO. It is also revealed that the conductivity of CCO is improved compared with pristine CCO. Our work highlights that non-metallic element doping is an effective strategy to greatly enhance the OER performance of spinel transition metal oxide electrocatalysts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["amorphous", "CuCo2O4", "oxygen evolution reaction", "Phosphorus doped", "transition metal oxide"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alkaline electrolytes", "Crystalline phase", "Noble metal catalysts", "Non-metallic elements", "Number of active sites", "Oxygen evolution reaction (oer)", "Synergistic effect", "Water electrolysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096659432", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Electrochemistry", "CHEM", "1603"]], "AuthorData": {"57220052453": {"Name": "Guo Z.", "AuthorID": "57220052453", "AffiliationID": "60073523, 60002246, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Structural Chemistry, Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "57207941695": {"Name": "Pang Y.", "AuthorID": "57207941695", "AffiliationID": "60073523, 60002246, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Structural Chemistry, Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "57218541771": {"Name": "Xie H.", "AuthorID": "57218541771", "AffiliationID": "60073523, 60002246, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Structural Chemistry, Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "55161802400": {"Name": "Chai G.L.", "AuthorID": "55161802400", "AffiliationID": "125215981", "AffiliationName": "Fujian Science & Technology Innovation Laboratory for Optoelectronic Information of China"}, "55626024600": {"Name": "He G.", "AuthorID": "55626024600", "AffiliationID": "60026830", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Lincoln"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
