Overall, the clinical management of patients with cirrhosis is based on the observation of clinical events mostly related to complications of portal hypertension. Each event of cirrhosis decompensation has clear prognostic implications although it is not precisely predictable. In practice, the advancement in the knowledge of the mechanisms responsible for disease progression is not yet translated in clinical tools allowing the stratification of the cirrhotic stage according to pathophysiological mechanisms. This article provides a review of the main clinical and histopathological features of liver cirrhosis that are relevant for its clinical stratification together with the advancements provided by the introduction of non-invasive measures of portal hypertension. Other clinical aspects that have a major impact on the quality of life and the possibility of liver transplantation are also discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cirrhosis", "elastography", "hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG)", "hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)", "liver transplantation", "sarcopenia"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082332163", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57191850567": {"Name": "Maurice J.", "AuthorID": "57191850567", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7005412715": {"Name": "Pinzani M.", "AuthorID": "7005412715", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
