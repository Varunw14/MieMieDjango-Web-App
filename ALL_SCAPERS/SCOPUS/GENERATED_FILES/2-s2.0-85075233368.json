However, the ideal moment and context to indicate this exam in this group of patients remain controversial. We aimed to establish a consensus panel to address the role of UDS in MS patients. Methods: A panel representing urology, rehabilitation medicine, and neurology skilled in neuro-urology participated in a consensus-forming project using a Delphi method to reach consensus on the role of UDS in MS patients. Results: In total, five experts participated. All panelists participated in the four phases of the consensus process. Consensus was reached if \u226570% of the experts agreed on recommendations. To facilitate a common understanding among all experts, a face-to-face consensus meeting was held in Florence in September 2017 and then with a follow-up teleconference in March 2018. By the end of the Delphi process, formal consensus was achieved for 100% of the items and an algorithm was then developed in a face-to-face meeting in Philadelphia in August 2018. The final expert opinion recommendations were approved by the unanimous consensus of the panel. Conclusions: UDS represents an important diagnostic tool for MS patients and is particularly useful to evaluate the pattern of LUT dysfunction in high-risk patients. There is a lack of high-evidence level studies to support an optimal urodynamic long-term follow-up protocol.", "AuthorKeywords": ["diagnosis", "lower urinary tract symptoms", "multiple sclerosis", "risk factors", "urodynamics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Consensus", "Delphi Technique", "Humans", "Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Urodynamics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075233368", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"24775312700": {"Name": "Averbeck M.A.", "AuthorID": "24775312700", "AffiliationID": "101305613", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Moinhos de Vento Hospital"}, "55203554200": {"Name": "Iacovelli V.", "AuthorID": "55203554200", "AffiliationID": "105898700", "AffiliationName": "Urology Unit, San Carlo di Nancy General Hospital \u2013 GVM Care and Research"}, "6505829471": {"Name": "Finazzi Agr\u00f2 E.", "AuthorID": "6505829471", "AffiliationID": "60005075, 60027509", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgical Sciences, University of Rome Tor Vergata and Urology Unit, Policlinico Tor Vergata University Hospital"}, "8862148900": {"Name": "Panicker J.", "AuthorID": "8862148900", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Uro-Neurology, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "24424411000": {"Name": "Schurch B.", "AuthorID": "24424411000", "AffiliationID": "60023561", "AffiliationName": "Neurourology Unit, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University Hospital of Lausanne"}}}
