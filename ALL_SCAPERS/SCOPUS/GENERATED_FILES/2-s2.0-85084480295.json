All rights reserved.We examine the patterns of loanword adaptation in Maxakal\u00ed, a Macro-J\u00ea language of Brazil, in importing loans from Brazilian Portuguese, with respect to the introduction of nasality and nasal harmony, based on a corpus of 18 speakers. Employing MaxEnt modeling of quantitative trends enabled the comparison and analysis of certain recurrent trends, even if not exceptionless, and the potentially additive effects of their interaction. The results reveal that nasal harmonization, modeled as set of markedness constraints, is greatly enforced within syllable rimes, and strongly enforced within syllables, but shows little role for syllable-to-syllable harmony, demonstrating that harmonization is preferred within tighter prosodic domains. Word-initial consonants always retain their nasality or orality from Portuguese, and stressed vowels always preserve their nasality. These latter effects uphold the role of prominent positions in maintaining contrasts within loanword phonology. The overall patterns of loanword harmonization find convergence with certain characteristics within Maxakal\u00ed phonology itself.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Loanword phonology", "Maxakal\u00ed", "Nasal harmony"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084480295", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"57216750783": {"Name": "da Silva M.C.", "AuthorID": "57216750783", "AffiliationID": "60027136, 60030074", "AffiliationName": "Universidade Federal de Goi\u00e1s, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"}, "23025748800": {"Name": "Nevins A.", "AuthorID": "23025748800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
