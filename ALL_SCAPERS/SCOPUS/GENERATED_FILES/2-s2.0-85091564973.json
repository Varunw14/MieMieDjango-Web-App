All rights reserved.Low-glucose and -insulin conditions, associated with ketogenic diets, can reduce the activity of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway, potentially leading to a range of positive medical and health-related effects. Here, we determined whether mTORC1 signaling is also a target for decanoic acid, a key component of the medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) ketogenic diet. Using a tractable model system, Dictyostelium, we show that decanoic acid can decrease mTORC1 activity, under conditions of constant glucose and in the absence of insulin, measured by phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4Ebinding protein 1 (4E-BP1). We determine that this effect of decanoic acid is dependent on a ubiquitin regulatory X domain-containing protein, mediating inhibition of a conserved Dictyostelium AAA ATPase, p97, a homolog of the human transitional endoplasmic reticulum ATPase (VCP/p97) protein. We then demonstrate that decanoic acid decreases mTORC1 activity in the absence of insulin and under highglucose conditions in ex vivo rat hippocampus and in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) patient-derived astrocytes. Our data therefore indicate that dietary decanoic acid may provide a new therapeutic approach to down-regulate mTORC1 signaling.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Decanoic acid", "Dictyostelium discoideum", "Epilepsy", "mTOR", "Tuberous sclerosis complex"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Animals", "Astrocytes", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "Cells, Cultured", "Decanoic Acids", "Dictyostelium", "Epilepsy", "Glucose", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Insulin", "Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1", "Peptide Initiation Factors", "Phosphorylation", "Rats"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091564973", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57193185713": {"Name": "Warren E.C.", "AuthorID": "57193185713", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomedical Sciences, Department of Biological Sciences, Royal Holloway University of London"}, "57212379186": {"Name": "Damstra-Oddy J.", "AuthorID": "57212379186", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomedical Sciences, Department of Biological Sciences, Royal Holloway University of London"}, "57212390227": {"Name": "Schaf J.", "AuthorID": "57212390227", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomedical Sciences, Department of Biological Sciences, Royal Holloway University of London"}, "57203074071": {"Name": "Williams R.S.B.", "AuthorID": "57203074071", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomedical Sciences, Department of Biological Sciences, Royal Holloway University of London"}, "54898031600": {"Name": "Dooves S.", "AuthorID": "54898031600", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child and Youth Psychiatry, Amsterdam Universitair Medische Centra, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam"}, "8786575200": {"Name": "Heine V.M.", "AuthorID": "8786575200", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Complex Trait Genetics, Centre for Neurogenomics and Cognitive Research, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam"}, "55831141300": {"Name": "Lugar\u00e0 E.", "AuthorID": "55831141300", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy UCL, Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "35243898700": {"Name": "Walker M.C.", "AuthorID": "35243898700", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy UCL, Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
