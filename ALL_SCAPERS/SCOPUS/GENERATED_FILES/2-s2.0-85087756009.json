However, recent technological developments have streamlined the provision of translated captions and these advances are influencing awareness of and attitudes to the use of surtitles in theatre spaces. Taking the ITA\u2019s Roman Tragedies as an illustration, this article examines the application of surtitling technology in theatre translation. The intermedial performance of surtitles positions surtitles within new media dramaturgy, creating a form of interlinear translation. The dramaturgical effect of the integration of surtitles into production demonstrates how technological intervention can operate to co-produce the humanity of intercultural theatrical encounter.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dramaturgy", "interlinear translation", "intermedial performance", "surtitles", "theatre translation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087756009", "SubjectAreas": [["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"56071353900": {"Name": "Brodie G.", "AuthorID": "56071353900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Translation Studies, University College London"}}}
