Most discussion of statistical power (the ability of a study design to detect an effect) has focused on sample size, and assumed sufficient trials. Here we explore the influence of both factors on statistical power, represented as a 2-dimensional plot on which iso-power contours can be visualized. We demonstrate the conditions under which the number of trials is particularly important, that is, when the within-participant variance is large relative to the between-participants variance. We then derive power contour plots using existing data sets for 8 experimental paradigms and methodologies (including reaction times, sensory thresholds, fMRI, MEG, and EEG), and provide example code to calculate estimates of the within- and betweenparticipants variance for each method. In all cases, the within-participant variance was larger than the between-participants variance, meaning that the number of trials has a meaningful influence on statistical power in commonly used paradigms. An online tool is provided (https://shiny.york.ac.uk/powercontours/) for generating power contours, from which the optimal combination of trials and participants can be calculated when designing future studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Neuroscience", "Sample size", "Statistical power"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088472339", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (miscellaneous)", "PSYC", "3201"]], "AuthorData": {"15057725600": {"Name": "Baker D.H.", "AuthorID": "15057725600", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "56289856000": {"Name": "Vilidaite G.", "AuthorID": "56289856000", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57203343554": {"Name": "Lygo F.A.", "AuthorID": "57203343554", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57194033459": {"Name": "Smith A.K.", "AuthorID": "57194033459", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "56610124800": {"Name": "Flack T.R.", "AuthorID": "56610124800", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "28567744900": {"Name": "Gouws A.D.", "AuthorID": "28567744900", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57220514670": {"Name": "Andrews T.J.", "AuthorID": "57220514670", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
