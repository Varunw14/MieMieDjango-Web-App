Here, we describe the TIME of >6000 primarily pediatric CNS tumors using a deconvolution approach (methylCIBERSORT). We produce and validate a custom reference signature defining 11 non-cancer cell types to estimate relative proportions of infiltration in a panCNS tumor cohort spanning 80 subtypes. We group patients into three broad immune clusters associated with CNS tumor types/subtypes. In cohorts of medulloblastomas (n = 2325), malignant rhabdoid tumors (n = 229) and pediatric high-grade gliomas (n = 401), we show significant associations with molecular subgroups/subtypes, mutations, and prognosis. We further identify tumor-specific immune clusters with phenotypic characteristics relevant to immunotherapy response (i.e. Cytolytic score, PDL1 expression). Our analysis provides an indication of the potential future therapeutic and prognostic possibilities of immuno-methylomic profiling in pediatric CNS tumor patients that may ultimately inform approach to immune-therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Central Nervous System Neoplasms", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cohort Studies", "Glioma", "Histones", "Humans",
