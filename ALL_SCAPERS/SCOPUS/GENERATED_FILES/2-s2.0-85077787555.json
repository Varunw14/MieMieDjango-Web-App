However, the impact on performance and the robustness of improvements crucially depends on the availability of sufficiently large training corpora, which is a problem in the biomedical domain with its often rather small gold standard corpora. Results: We evaluate different methods for alleviating the data sparsity problem by pretraining a deep neural network (LSTM-CRF), followed by a rather short fine-tuning phase focusing on a particular corpus. Experiments were performed using 34 different corpora covering five different biomedical entity types, yielding an average increase in F1-score of \u223c2 pp compared to learning without pretraining. We experimented both with supervised and semi-supervised pretraining, leading to interesting insights into the precision/recall trade-off. Based on our results, we created the stand-alone NER tool HUNER incorporating fully trained models for five entity types. On the independent CRAFT corpus, which was not used for creating HUNER, it outperforms the state-of-the-art tools GNormPlus and tmChem by 5-13 pp on the entity types chemicals, species and genes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Computational Biology", "Data Analysis", "Neural Networks, Computer", "Software"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077787555", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"]], "AuthorData": {"57194978942": {"Name": "Weber L.", "AuthorID": "57194978942", "AffiliationID": "60000762", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science Department, Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin"}, "57193733023": {"Name": "M\u00fcnchmeyer J.", "AuthorID": "57193733023", "AffiliationID": "60030245", "AffiliationName": "Seismology Section, Helmholtzzentrum Potsdam, Deutsches GeoForschungsZentrum GFZ"}, "55406762500": {"Name": "Habibi M.", "AuthorID": "55406762500", "AffiliationID": "60000762", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science Department, Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin"}, "6602717727": {"Name": "Leser U.", "AuthorID": "6602717727", "AffiliationID": "60000762", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science Department, Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin"}, "55899274800": {"Name": "Rockt\u00e4schel T.", "AuthorID": "55899274800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
