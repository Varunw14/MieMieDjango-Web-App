European Journal of Immunology published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.Immunopathogenic roles for both Th1 (CD4+IFN-\u03b3+) and Th17 (CD4+IL-17A+) cells have been demonstrated in experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU). However, the role for Th17/Th1 (CD4+ T cells co-expressing IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17A) cells in EAU is not yet understood. Using interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein peptide-induced EAU in mice, we found increased levels of Th17/Th1 cells in EAU retinae (mean 9.6 \u00b1 4.2%) and draining LNs (mean 8.4 \u00b1 3.9%; p = 0.01) relative to controls. Topical dexamethasone treatment effectively reduced EAU severity and decreased retinal Th1 cells (p = 0.01), but had no impact on retinal Th17/Th1 or Th17 cells compared to saline controls. Using in vitro migration assays with mouse CNS endothelium, we demonstrated that Th17/Th1 cells were significantly increased within the migrated population relative to controls (mean 15.6 \u00b1 9.5% vs. 1.9 \u00b1 1.5%; p = 0.01). Chemokine receptor profiles of Th17/Th1 cells (CXCR3 and CCR6) did not change throughout the transendothelial migration process and were unaffected by dexamethasone treatment. These findings support a role for Th17/Th1 cells in EAU and their resistance to steroid inhibition suggests the importance of targeting both Th17 and Th17/Th1 cells for improving therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["experimental autoimmune uveitis", "IL-17A+IFN-\u03b3+", "steroid resistance", "T cell migration", "Th17/Th1 cells"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089996263", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"56003091700": {"Name": "Chen Y.H.", "AuthorID": "56003091700", "AffiliationID": "60020351", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine, Chang Gung University"}, "6507269761": {"Name": "Eskandarpour M.", "AuthorID": "6507269761", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57218672907": {"Name": "Gondrand A.", "AuthorID": "57218672907", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57201652534": {"Name": "Zhang X.", "AuthorID": "57201652534", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57218671576": {"Name": "Gu R.", "AuthorID": "57218671576", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "12772406600": {"Name": "Galatowicz G.", "AuthorID": "12772406600", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "15035438500": {"Name": "Lightman S.L.", "AuthorID": "15035438500", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7003742122": {"Name": "Calder V.L.", "AuthorID": "7003742122", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}}}
