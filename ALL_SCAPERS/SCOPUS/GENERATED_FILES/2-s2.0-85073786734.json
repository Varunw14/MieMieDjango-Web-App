Woody biomass has a role in sustainable energy transitions, contributing to emissions reduction, economic development, and energy security as a dispatchable resource. This potential is recognized globally, but the woody biomass supply chain has faced technical and social challenges. Smart technologies are increasingly discussed in discourse on supply chain management, such as their potential to improve transparency and efficiency. Despite a variety of research related to woody biomass as well as smart technologies, little attention has been given to integrating the two perspectives. This study explores this intersection by highlighting smart technologies and mechanisms by which they may contribute to overcoming challenges in the woody biomass supply chain, exemplified by the case of Japan. Based on qualitative expert interviews, exploratory results suggest potential of smart technologies that would contribute to addressing both social and technical challenges of woody biomass in Japan. These challenges include transportation infrastructure, biomass quality management, business model integration (cascading), stakeholder relationship management, and local community revitalization and socioeconomic development. This contribution is based on various mechanisms such as improved transparency, information-sharing, accountability, automation, and value maximization. The results of this paper delineate a potential future development path that integrates smart technologies, woody biomass supply chains, and sustainability goals. This is an important further consideration for energy policy in academia, industry, as well as government.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bioenergy", "Decentralized energy", "Japan", "Smart technology", "Supply chain", "Woody biomass"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073786734", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Nature and Landscape Conservation", "ENVI", "2309"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"57200126715": {"Name": "Ahl A.", "AuthorID": "57200126715", "AffiliationID": "60031126", "AffiliationName": "Department of Innovation Science, School of Environment and Society, Tokyo Institute of Technology"}, "7403505871": {"Name": "Goto M.", "AuthorID": "7403505871", "AffiliationID": "60031126", "AffiliationName": "Department of Innovation Science, School of Environment and Society, Tokyo Institute of Technology"}, "23037745200": {"Name": "Yarime M.", "AuthorID": "23037745200", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Public Policy, The University of Tokyo"}}}
