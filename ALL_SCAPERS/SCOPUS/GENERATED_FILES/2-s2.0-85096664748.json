This ability renders them useful for applications such as catalysis and the sequestration of precious materials. A simple and general method for the immobilization of coordination cages on alumina is reported. Cage loadings are quantified via adsorption isotherms and guest displacement assays demonstrate that the adsorbed cages retain the ability to encapsulate and separate guest and non-guest molecules. Finally, a system of two cages, adsorbed on to different regions of alumina, stabilizes and separates a pair of Diels\u2013Alder reagents. The addition of a single competitive guest results in the controlled release of the reagents, thus triggering their reaction. This method of coordination cage immobilization on solid phases is envisaged to be applicable to the extensive library of reported cages, enabling new applications based upon selective solid-phase molecular encapsulation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adsorption", "coordination cages", "self-assembly", "supramolecular chemistry"], "IndexKeywords": ["Controlled release", "Coordination cage", "Displacement assay", "General method", "Guest molecules", "Molecular encapsulation", "New applications", "Solid phasis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096664748", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"57220059832": {"Name": "Ryan H.P.", "AuthorID": "57220059832", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Department of Chemistry"}, "35974995200": {"Name": "Haynes C.J.E.", "AuthorID": "35974995200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57203190213": {"Name": "Smith A.", "AuthorID": "57203190213", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Department of Chemistry"}, "57000374100": {"Name": "Grommet A.B.", "AuthorID": "57000374100", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Department of Chemistry"}, "7006312850": {"Name": "Nitschke J.R.", "AuthorID": "7006312850", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Department of Chemistry"}}}
