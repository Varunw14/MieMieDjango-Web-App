Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) is considered to be the highest priority for vaccine development. This view is underscored by the significant morbidity associated with congenital hCMV infection and viraemia in transplant patients. Although a number of vaccines have been trialed, none have been licensed. The hCMV vaccine candidate that has performed best in clinical trials to date is the recombinant glycoprotein B (gB) vaccine that has demonstrated protection, ranging from a 43% to 50% efficacy in three independent phase II trials. In this review, we focus on data from the phase II trial performed in solid organ transplant patients and the outcomes of follow-up studies attempting to identify immunological and mechanistic correlates of protection associated with this vaccine strategy. We relate this to other vaccine studies of gB as well as other vaccine strategies to determine areas of commonality and divergence. Finally, through the review, we discuss the unique challenges and opportunities presented with vaccine studies in transplant populations with recommendations that could empower subsequent trials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antibodies", "Cytomegalovirus", "GB", "Vaccine"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071357438", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57193513675": {"Name": "Gomes A.", "AuthorID": "57193513675", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Immunity and Transplantation, University College London"}, "36478462600": {"Name": "Griffiths P.", "AuthorID": "36478462600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Immunity and Transplantation, University College London"}, "9635566600": {"Name": "Reeves M.", "AuthorID": "9635566600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Immunity and Transplantation, University College London"}}}
