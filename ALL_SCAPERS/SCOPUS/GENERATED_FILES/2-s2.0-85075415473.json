Birth Defects Research published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Background: Neural tube defects (NTDs) result from failure of neural tube closure during embryogenesis. These severe birth defects of the central nervous system include anencephaly and spina bifida, and affect 0.5\u20132 per 1,000 pregnancies worldwide in humans. It has been demonstrated that acetylation plays a pivotal role during neural tube closure, as animal models for defective histone acetyltransferase proteins display NTDs. Acetylation represents an important component of the complex network of posttranslational regulatory interactions, suggesting a possible fundamental role during primary neurulation events. This study aimed to assess protein acetylation contribution to early patterning of the central nervous system both in human and murine specimens. Methods: We used both human and mouse (Cited2\u2212/\u2212) samples to analyze the dynamic acetylation of proteins during embryo development through immunohistochemistry, western blot analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results: We report the dynamic profile of histone and protein acetylation status during neural tube closure. We also report a rescue effect in an animal model by chemical p53 inhibition. Conclusions: Our data suggest that the p53-acetylation equilibrium may play a role in primary neurulation in mammals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["acetylation profile", "Cited2", "neural tube defects", "neurodevelopment", "p53"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075415473", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Embryology", "MEDI", "2710"], ["Toxicology", "PHAR", "3005"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis", "ENVI", "2307"]], "AuthorData": {"6701628384": {"Name": "Massa V.", "AuthorID": "6701628384", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of Milan"}, "55908358200": {"Name": "Avagliano L.", "AuthorID": "55908358200", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of Milan"}, "57197783086": {"Name": "Grazioli P.", "AuthorID": "57197783086", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of Milan"}, "57205138741": {"Name": "Parodi C.", "AuthorID": "57205138741", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of Milan"}, "6602618052": {"Name": "Doi P.", "AuthorID": "6602618052", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of Milan"}, "6603776966": {"Name": "Bulfamante G.", "AuthorID": "6603776966", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of Milan"}, "16303182000": {"Name": "De Castro S.C.P.", "AuthorID": "16303182000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "10539322200": {"Name": "Savery D.", "AuthorID": "10539322200", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7006634311": {"Name": "Copp A.J.", "AuthorID": "7006634311", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "35587452100": {"Name": "Greene N.D.E.", "AuthorID": "35587452100", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "55381774200": {"Name": "Vergani P.", "AuthorID": "55381774200", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Foundation MBBM, University of Milano-Bicocca"}, "57205613846": {"Name": "Cuttin S.", "AuthorID": "57205613846", "AffiliationID": "60014378, 60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, San Gerardo Hospital, University of Milano-Bicocca"}}}
