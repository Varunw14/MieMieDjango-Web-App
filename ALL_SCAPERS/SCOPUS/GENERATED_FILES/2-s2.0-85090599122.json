Criterion A events might have greater predictive validity for International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-11 PTSD, which is a condition more narrowly defined by core features. We evaluated the impact of using Criterion A, an expanded trauma definition in line with ICD-11 guidelines, and no exposure criterion on rates of ICD-11 PTSD and Complex PTSD (CPTSD). We also assessed whether 5 psychologically threatening events included in the expanded definition were as strongly associated with PTSD and CPTSD as standard Criterion A events. Method: A nationally representative sample from Ireland (N = 1,020) completed self-report measures. Results: Most participants were trauma-exposed based on Criterion A (82%) and the expanded (88%) criterion. When no exposure criterion was used, 13.7% met diagnostic requirements for PTSD or CPTSD, 13.2% when the expanded criterion was used, and 13.2% when Criterion A was used. The 5 psychologically threatening events were as strongly associated with PTSD and CPTSD as the Criterion A events. In a multivariate analysis, only the psychologically threatening events were significantly associated with PTSD (stalking) and CPTSD (bullying, emotional abuse, and neglect). Conclusions: Certain non-Criterion A events involving extreme fear and horror should be considered traumatic. The ICD-11 approach of providing clinical guidance rather than a formal definition offers a viable solution to some of the problems associated with the current and previous attempts to define traumatic exposure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Complex PTSD", "Criterion A", "PTSD", "Trauma exposure"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090599122", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"55113504900": {"Name": "Hyland P.", "AuthorID": "55113504900", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "16425957200": {"Name": "Karatzias T.", "AuthorID": "16425957200", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7004128606": {"Name": "Shevlin M.", "AuthorID": "7004128606", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "56079814100": {"Name": "McElroy E.", "AuthorID": "56079814100", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "6603955727": {"Name": "Ben-Ezra M.", "AuthorID": "6603955727", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "35420810100": {"Name": "Cloitre M.", "AuthorID": "35420810100", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7006656085": {"Name": "Brewin C.R.", "AuthorID": "7006656085", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
