We discuss what is involved in knowing when and how and for whom change needs to occur, as well as the impact of doing so at scale-especially when novelty and academic contributions may be compromised. To this end, we present a 'scaling up' framework based on a societal project where we worked with multiple stakeholders to improve food waste recycling rates in a housing estate. We propose three main factors involved in scaling up: (i) 'the people,' through reimagining roles and relationships, (ii) 'the method,' requiring flexibility in design and research, and (iii) 'the impact,' informing new measures by handing over the evaluation. We reflect on the challenges, dilemmas, and successes encountered, as well as discuss the benefit of 'handing over' the evaluation process to gather scalable metrics based on economic modelling.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Behavior change", "Food waste recycling", "Multi-stakeholder collaboration", "Scaling up"], "IndexKeywords": ["Economic modelling", "Multiple stakeholders", "Scaling-up", "Societal problems", "Waste recycling"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090499612", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"36096317400": {"Name": "Seaborn K.", "AuthorID": "36096317400", "AffiliationID": "60031126", "AffiliationName": "Tokyo Institute of Technology"}, "57194277749": {"Name": "M\u00e4h\u00f6nen J.", "AuthorID": "57194277749", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7003925319": {"Name": "Rogers Y.", "AuthorID": "7003925319", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
