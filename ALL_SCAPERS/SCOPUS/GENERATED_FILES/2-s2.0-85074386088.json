In this work, novel calcium phosphate glasses containing 0, 2, 4, and 6 mol % Cu2+ were synthesized via room temperature precipitation reaction in aqueous solution. The effect of Cu2+ addition on the glass properties and structure was investigated using thermal analysis, 31P solid-state MAS NMR, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. All glasses crystallize at temperature >500 \u00b0C and are mainly formed by Q1 groups. The release of P, Ca, and Cu in solution over time was monitored via inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy. It was found that with increasing Cu content, the amount of P and Ca released decreases whereas the amount of Cu released increases. The effect of Cu2+ release on the antibacterial activity against S. aureus, a bacterial strain commonly found in postsurgery infections, has been investigated. The addition of copper has been shown to infer the glasses antibacterial properties. As expected, the antibacterial activity of the glasses increases with increasing Cu2+ content. Cytocompatibility was assessed by seeding human osteoblast-like osteosarcoma cells Saos-2 (HTB85) on the glass particles. A significant increase in cell number was observed in all the glasses investigated. The copper-doped calcium phosphate glasses have proven to be multifunctional, as they combine bone regenerative properties with antibacterial activity. Therefore, they have great potential as antibacterial bioresorbable materials for hard tissue regeneration.", "AuthorKeywords": ["antibacterial activity", "bone regeneration", "calcium phosphate glasses", "controlled ion release"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-bacterial activity", "Antibacterial properties", "Bone regeneration", "Bone tissue regeneration", "Calcium phosphate glass", "Doped calcium phosphates", "Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy", "Ion release"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074386088", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"55556089800": {"Name": "Foroutan F.", "AuthorID": "55556089800", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Surrey"}, "57211557981": {"Name": "McGuire J.", "AuthorID": "57211557981", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Surrey"}, "57211558633": {"Name": "Nikolaou A.", "AuthorID": "57211558633", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Surrey"}, "57211563317": {"Name": "Kyffin B.A.", "AuthorID": "57211563317", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Surrey"}, "55884178000": {"Name": "Carta D.", "AuthorID": "55884178000", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Surrey"}, "57211559776": {"Name": "Gupta P.", "AuthorID": "57211559776", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Process Engineering, Bioprocess and Biochemical Engineering Group (BioProChem), University of Surrey"}, "24765731400": {"Name": "Velliou E.", "AuthorID": "24765731400", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Process Engineering, Bioprocess and Biochemical Engineering Group (BioProChem), University of Surrey"}, "35477408000": {"Name": "Gutierrez-Merino J.", "AuthorID": "35477408000", "AffiliationID": "60021097, 60172391", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences and Medicine, University of Surrey"}, "57203748554": {"Name": "Kelly N.L.", "AuthorID": "57203748554", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}, "7201367060": {"Name": "Hanna J.V.", "AuthorID": "7201367060", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}, "26643634100": {"Name": "Knowles J.C.", "AuthorID": "26643634100", "AffiliationID": "60002877", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Eastman-Korea Dental Medicine Innovation Centre, Dankook University"}, "57203373078": {"Name": "Baek S.Y.", "AuthorID": "57203373078", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}}}
