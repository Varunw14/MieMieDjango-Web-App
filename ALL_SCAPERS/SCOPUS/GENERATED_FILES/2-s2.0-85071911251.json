This paper presents an in-depth case study of post-breach security changes made by a company and the consequences of those changes. We employ the principles of participatory action research and humble inquiry to conduct a long-Term study with employee interviews while embedded in the organization's security division. Despite an extremely high level of financial investment in security, and consistent attention and involvement from the board, the interviews indicate a significant level of friction between employees and security. In the main themes that emerged from our data analysis, a number of factors shed light on the friction: fear of another breach leading to zero risk appetite, impossible security controls making non-compliance a norm, security theatre underminining the purpose of security policies, employees often trading-off security with productivity, and as such being treated as children in detention rather than employees trying to finish their paid jobs. This paper shows that post-breach security changes can be complex and sometimes risky due to emotions often being involved. Without an approach considerate of how humans and security interact, even with high financial investment, attempts to change an organization's security behaviour may be ineffective.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Data breach", "Humble inquiry", "Participatory action research", "Post-breach security", "Security culture"], "IndexKeywords": ["Data breach", "Financial investments", "Humble inquiry", "Number of factors", "Participatory action research", "Post-breach security", "Security breaches", "Security controls"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071911251", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Information Systems and Management", "DECI", "1802"], ["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"]], "AuthorData": {"57210934022": {"Name": "Demjaha A.", "AuthorID": "57210934022", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Computer Science, University College London"}, "56235823000": {"Name": "Caulfield T.", "AuthorID": "56235823000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7003530277": {"Name": "Angela Sasse M.", "AuthorID": "7003530277", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Computer Science, University College London"}, "57207511534": {"Name": "Pym D.", "AuthorID": "57207511534", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
