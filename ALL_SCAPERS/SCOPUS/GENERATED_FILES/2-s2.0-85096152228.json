CTX prophylaxis reduces mortality and morbidity among people living with HIV in regions with high prevalence of bacterial infections and malaria. The Antiretroviral research for Watoto trial evaluated the effect of stopping versus continuing CTX prophylaxis in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: In this study, 72 HIV-infected Zimbabwean children, on antiretroviral therapy, provided fecal samples at 84 and 96 weeks after randomization to continue or stop CTX. DNA was extracted for whole metagenome shotgun sequencing, with sequencing reads mapped to the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database to identify CTX and other antimicrobial resistance genes. RESULTS: There were minimal differences in the carriage of CTX resistance genes between groups. The dfrA1 gene, conferring trimethoprim resistance, was significantly higher in the continue group (P = 0.039) and the tetA(P) gene conferring resistance to tetracycline was significantly higher in the stop group (P = 0.013). CTX prophylaxis has a role in shaping the resistome; however, stopping prophylaxis does not decrease resistance gene abundance. CONCLUSIONS: No differences were observed in resistance gene carriage between the stop and continue groups. The previously shown multi-faceted protective effects of CTX in antiretroviral research for Watoto trial clinical outcomes are not outweighed by the risk of multi-drug resistance gene selection due to prophylaxis. These findings are reassuring, given current recommendations for long-term CTX prophylaxis among children living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa to decrease mortality and morbidity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096152228", "SubjectAreas": [["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57205717042": {"Name": "Francis F.", "AuthorID": "57205717042", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Experimental Medicine, University of British Columbia"}, "8254666200": {"Name": "Gough E.K.", "AuthorID": "8254666200", "AffiliationID": "60006183", "AffiliationName": "Department of International Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, MD"}, "56584287900": {"Name": "Edens T.J.", "AuthorID": "56584287900", "AffiliationID": "60012171", "AffiliationName": "Devil's Staircase Consulting, BC Centre for Disease Control, West Vancouver"}, "6507984939": {"Name": "Berejena C.", "AuthorID": "6507984939", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "University of Zimbabwe College of Health Sciences"}, "36554025300": {"Name": "Bwakura-Dangarembizi M.", "AuthorID": "36554025300", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "University of Zimbabwe College of Health Sciences"}, "55984920200": {"Name": "Shonhai A.", "AuthorID": "55984920200", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "University of Zimbabwe College of Health Sciences"}, "57210663714": {"Name": "Nathoo K.J.", "AuthorID": "57210663714", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "University of Zimbabwe College of Health Sciences"}, "57200406494": {"Name": "Glass M.", "AuthorID": "57200406494", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "School of Population and Public Health, University of British Columbia"}, "6507779903": {"Name": "Manges A.R.", "AuthorID": "6507779903", "AffiliationID": "60012171", "AffiliationName": "British Columbia Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC)"}, "35495600000": {"Name": "Gibb D.M.", "AuthorID": "35495600000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at University College London"}, "15760719100": {"Name": "Prendergast A.J.", "AuthorID": "15760719100", "AffiliationID": "113913855", "AffiliationName": "Zvitambo Institute for Maternal and Child Health Research"}}}
