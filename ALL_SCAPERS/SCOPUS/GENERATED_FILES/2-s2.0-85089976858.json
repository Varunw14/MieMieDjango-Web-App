Subgroup analyses assessed whether the efficacy of FF/UMEC/VI versus FF/VI or UMEC/VI and UMEC/VI versus FF/VI varies according to prior exacerbation history, and the combined effects of exacerbation history and blood eosinophil counts. Three subgroups were defined: single moderate (1 moderate/no severe; n=3056 (30%)), frequent moderate (\u22672 moderate/no severe; n=4628 (45%)) and severe (\u22671 severe/any moderate; n=2671 (26%)). End-points included annual on-treatment moderate/severe exacerbation rate (pre-specified), lung function and health status (both post-hoc). Moderate/severe exacerbation rates (reduction % (95% CI)) were reduced in the FF/UMEC/VI group versus FF/VI (single moderate 20% (10\u201329), frequent moderate 11% (2\u201319), severe 17% (7\u201326)) and versus UMEC/VI (single moderate 18% (5\u201329), frequent moderate 29% (21\u201337), severe 26% (14\u201335)). Moderate/severe exacerbation rates were reduced in the FF/VI group versus UMEC/VI in the frequent moderate subgroup; a numerical reduction was observed in the severe subgroup (single moderate 2% (-12\u201318), frequent moderate 21% (11\u201329), severe 11% (-3\u201322)). Moderate/severe exacerbation rates were lower in the FF/VI group compared with UMEC/VI in patients with higher eosinophil counts. FF/UMEC/VI improved lung function and health status versus both dual therapies irrespective of exacerbation subgroup. UMEC/VI improved lung function versus FF/VI in all subgroups. Triple therapy was more effective than dual regardless of exacerbation history, consistent with results in the intent-to-treat population. Comparisons between dual therapies were influenced by prior exacerbation history and eosinophil counts.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089976858", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"7005149597": {"Name": "Halpin D.M.G.", "AuthorID": "7005149597", "AffiliationID": "60111707, 60026479", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School, College of Medicine and Health, University of Exeter"}, "6603516755": {"Name": "Dransfield M.T.", "AuthorID": "6603516755", "AffiliationID": "60027086", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine, Lung Health Center, University of Alabama at Birmingham"}, "57215721222": {"Name": "Han M.L.K.", "AuthorID": "57215721222", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "University of Michigan, Pulmonary & Critical Care"}, "57201992613": {"Name": "Elaine Jones C.", "AuthorID": "57201992613", "AffiliationID": "60097308", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline"}, "54986991300": {"Name": "Kilbride S.", "AuthorID": "54986991300", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline"}, "36049158200": {"Name": "Lange P.", "AuthorID": "36049158200", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "University of Copenhagen"}, "7006039053": {"Name": "Lipson D.A.", "AuthorID": "7006039053", "AffiliationID": "60003711, 60006297", "AffiliationName": "Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania"}, "7003873209": {"Name": "Pascoe S.", "AuthorID": "7003873209", "AffiliationID": "101614872", "AffiliationName": "Sanofi"}, "56892645500": {"Name": "Lomas D.A.", "AuthorID": "56892645500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Respiratory, University College London"}, "7402221202": {"Name": "Martinez F.J.", "AuthorID": "7402221202", "AffiliationID": "60019868, 60018043", "AffiliationName": "New York-Presbyterian Hospital, Weill Cornell Medical Center"}, "36805302200": {"Name": "Singh D.", "AuthorID": "36805302200", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60120605", "AffiliationName": "University of Manchester, NIHR Manchester Biomedical Research Centre, Manchester University NHS Foundation Hospitals Trust"}, "55426245000": {"Name": "Wise R.", "AuthorID": "55426245000", "AffiliationID": "60006433", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Johns Hopkins Medicine"}, "57214687096": {"Name": "Criner G.J.", "AuthorID": "57214687096", "AffiliationID": "60013936, 60030398", "AffiliationName": "Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University"}}}
