Different impeller designs including conventional and new designs, were used to consider both axial and radial flow impellers. The electric conductivity method, suspended motor system and observation method were employed to determine the mixing time, the power consumption and the air entrainment point, respectively. The reduction in the impeller clearance level form T/3 to T/6 resulted in a decrease in power number values for up-flow pumping impellers while it was increased for down-flow pumping. The same trend was observed for the mixing time results. Moreover, axial flow impellers and specially HE3 are preferable for higher agitation speeds due to the less air entrainment. The results verified that the axial flow impellers and specifically down-flow impellers are more efficient than the radial flow impellers. ANFIS-Fuzzy C\u2013means (ANFIS\u2013FcM) and nonlinear regression were used to develop models to predict the mixing time based on the energy dissipation rate and clearance. The results verified that the model predictions successfully fit the experimental mixing time data.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ANFIS-Fuzzy C-means", "Energy dissipation rate", "Impeller design, clearance level", "Mixing time", "Nonlinear regression"], "IndexKeywords": ["Clearance level", "Energy dissipation rate", "Fuzzy C mean", "Mixing time", "Non-linear regression"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076906238", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"55524262900": {"Name": "Afshar Ghotli R.", "AuthorID": "55524262900", "AffiliationID": "60029157", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ocean and Earth Sciences (IOES), Research Management and Innovation Centre, University of Malaya"}, "7202480735": {"Name": "Ibrahim S.", "AuthorID": "7202480735", "AffiliationID": "60029157", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ocean and Earth Sciences (IOES), Research Management and Innovation Centre, University of Malaya"}, "36337980400": {"Name": "Shafeeyan M.S.", "AuthorID": "36337980400", "AffiliationID": "60109911", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Golestan University"}, "57218355700": {"Name": "Abbasi M.R.", "AuthorID": "57218355700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "57208873240": {"Name": "Abdul Raman A.A.", "AuthorID": "57208873240", "AffiliationID": "60029157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Malaya"}}}
