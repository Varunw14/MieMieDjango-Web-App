Alzheimer's & Dementia: Diagnosis, Assessment & Disease Monitoring published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of the Alzheimer's Association.Introduction: Dozens of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated loci have been identified in European-descent populations, but their effects have not been thoroughly investigated in the Hong Kong Chinese population. Methods: TaqMan array genotyping was performed for known AD-associated variants in a Hong Kong Chinese cohort. Regression analysis was conducted to study the associations of variants with AD-associated traits and biomarkers. Lasso regression was applied to establish a polygenic risk score (PRS) model for AD risk prediction. Results: SORL1 is associated with AD in the Hong Kong Chinese population. Meta-analysis corroborates the AD-protective effect of the SORL1 rs11218343 C allele. The PRS is developed and associated with AD risk, cognitive status, and AD-related endophenotypes. TREM2 H157Y might influence the amyloid beta 42/40 ratio and levels of immune-associated proteins in plasma. Discussion: SORL1 is associated with AD in the Hong Kong Chinese population. The PRS model can predict AD risk and cognitive status in this population.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "disease risk", "polygenic risk score", "population genetics", "SORL1"],
