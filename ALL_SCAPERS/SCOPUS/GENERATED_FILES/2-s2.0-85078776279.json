Advertisers can take user information into account when making their bids and get more control over the process. The goal of an optimal bidding function is to maximise the overall effectiveness of the ad campaigns defined by the advertisers under a certain budget constraint. A straightforward solution would be to model the bidding function in an explicit form. However, such functional solutions lack generality in practice and are insensitive to the stochastic behaviour of other bidders in the environment. In this paper, we propose to formulate the online auctions into a general mean field multi-agent framework, in which the agents compete with each other and each agent's best response strategy depends on its opponents' actions. We firstly introduce a novel Deep Attentive Survival Analysis (DASA) model to estimate the opponent's action distribution on the ad impression level which outperforms state-of-the-art survival analysis. Furthermore, we introduce the DASA model as the opponent model into the Mean Field Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) algorithm for each agent to learn the optimal bidding strategy and converge to the mean field equilibrium. The experiments have shown that with the inference of the market, the market converges to the equilibrium faster while playing against both fixed strategy agents and dynamic learning agents.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deep reinforcement learning", "Multi-agent", "Real-time bidding"], "IndexKeywords": ["Functional solution", "Multi agent", "Multiagent framework", "Opponent modeling", "Optimal bidding strategy", "Overall effectiveness", "Real time", "Survival analysis"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078776279", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"57193342165": {"Name": "Du M.", "AuthorID": "57193342165", "AffiliationID": "121093151", "AffiliationName": "MediaGamma Ltd."}, "6701557624": {"Name": "Brorsson M.", "AuthorID": "6701557624", "AffiliationID": "60072562", "AffiliationName": "University of Luxembourg"}, "57193765428": {"Name": "State R.", "AuthorID": "57193765428", "AffiliationID": "60072562", "AffiliationName": "University of Luxembourg"}, "57203816687": {"Name": "Cowen-Rivers A.I.", "AuthorID": "57203816687", "AffiliationID": "121093151", "AffiliationName": "MediaGamma Ltd."}, "57193525684": {"Name": "Wen Y.", "AuthorID": "57193525684", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57214442546": {"Name": "Sakulwongtana P.", "AuthorID": "57214442546", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55902731900": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "55902731900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
