Five major biologically unrelated hepatotropic viruses cause most of the global burden of viral hepatitis. Hepatitis B and hepatitis C are associated with a significant number of chronic infections. Most deaths from viral hepatitis are due to hepatitis B and hepatitis C. An estimated 257 million people were living with HBV and 71 million people were living with HCV. Most people are asymptomatic. New diagnostics and highly effective, pangenotypic direct-acting antivirals provide opportunities to cure and eradicate chronic hepatitis C virus infection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acute viral hepatitis", "Chronic viral hepatitis", "HAV", "HBV", "HCV", "HDV", "HEV"], "IndexKeywords": ["Global Health", "Hepatitis Viruses", "Hepatitis, Viral, Human", "Humans"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073835559", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"24460488500": {"Name": "Lanini S.", "AuthorID": "24460488500", "AffiliationID": "60072494", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Infectious Diseases, Lazzaro Spallanzani"}, "55336029300": {"Name": "Pisapia R.", "AuthorID": "55336029300", "AffiliationID": "60072494", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Infectious Diseases, Lazzaro Spallanzani"}, "6602482250": {"Name": "Ustianowski A.", "AuthorID": "6602482250", "AffiliationID": "60007321", "AffiliationName": "North Manchester General Hospital"}, "7006170723": {"Name": "Zumla A.", "AuthorID": "7006170723", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Center for Clinical Microbiology, University College London"}, "57208096848": {"Name": "Ippolito G.", "AuthorID": "57208096848", "AffiliationID": "60072494", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Infectious Diseases, Lazzaro Spallanzani"}}}
