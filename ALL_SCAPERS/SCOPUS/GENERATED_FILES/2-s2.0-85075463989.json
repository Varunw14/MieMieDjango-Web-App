However, it is challenging to extend Q-learning to large-scale multi-agent scenarios, due to the explosion of action space resulting from the complex dynamics between the environment and the agents. In this paper, we propose to make the computation of multi-agent Q-learning tractable by treating the Q-function (w.r.t. state and joint-action) as a high-order high-dimensional tensor and then approximate it with factorized pairwise interactions. Furthermore, we utilize a composite deep neural network architecture for computing the factorized Q-function, share the model parameters among all the agents within the same group, and estimate the agents\u2019 optimal joint actions through a coordinate descent type algorithm. All these simplifications greatly reduce the model complexity and accelerate the learning process. Extensive experiments on two different multi-agent problems demonstrate the performance gain of our proposed approach in comparison with strong baselines, particularly when there are a large number of agents.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Large-Scale Multi-Agent Systems", "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Complex dynamics", "Coordinate descent", "High-dimensional", "Large-scale multi-agent systems", "Multi-agent problems", "Multi-agent Q-learning", "Multi-agent reinforcement learning", "Pairwise interaction"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075463989", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"57204819296": {"Name": "Zhou M.", "AuthorID": "57204819296", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "57211937932": {"Name": "Su Y.", "AuthorID": "57211937932", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "56108513500": {"Name": "Zhang W.", "AuthorID": "56108513500", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "55959920500": {"Name": "Chen Y.", "AuthorID": "55959920500", "AffiliationID": "60013789", "AffiliationName": "Beihang University"}, "57193525684": {"Name": "Wen Y.", "AuthorID": "57193525684", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57195976135": {"Name": "Yang Y.", "AuthorID": "57195976135", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57214697428": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "57214697428", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7405356099": {"Name": "Zhang D.", "AuthorID": "7405356099", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Birkbeck, University of London"}}}
