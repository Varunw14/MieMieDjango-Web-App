MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MEDLINE\u00ae and Scopus\u00ae databases were searched up to March 2019. The review protocol was published in the PROSPERO database (CRD42019125549). The clinical factors and markers studied were age, prostate specific antigen, prostate specific antigen isoforms, prostate specific antigen density, PCA3, prostate volume, family history, ethnicity and risk calculators. The primary objective was to determine their predictive ability for clinically significant prostate cancer diagnosis. Secondary objectives included meta-analysis of the negative predictive value of prebiopsy negative magnetic resonance imaging when combined with these predictive factors. RESULTS: A total of 16 studies were eligible for inclusion. Few studies reported negative predictive value of magnetic resonance imaging combined with a marker. Prostate specific antigen density was the best studied and the strongest predictor of clinically significant prostate cancer in men with prebiopsy negative magnetic resonance imaging. There were 8 studies (1,015 patients) eligible for meta-analysis of the added value of prostate specific antigen density less than 0.15 ng/ml/ml to magnetic resonance imaging in reducing the risk of missing clinically significant prostate cancer. When combined with prostate specific antigen density, overall magnetic resonance imaging negative predictive value increased from 84.4% to 90.4% in cancer na\u00efve patients. The increase was from 82.7% to 88.7% in biopsy na\u00efve and from 88.2% to 94.1% in previous negative biopsy subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: The use of prostate specific antigen density less than 0.15 ng/ml/ml in the presence of prebiopsy negative magnetic resonance imaging was the most useful factor to identify men without clinically significant prostate cancer who could avoid biopsy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["magnetic resonance imaging", "negative results", "predictive value of tests", "prostatic neoplasms", "risk factors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Clinical Decision Rules", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Missed Diagnosis", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "Risk Assessment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085194176", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"57217122877": {"Name": "Pagniez M.A.", "AuthorID": "57217122877", "AffiliationID": "108043428", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology"}, "7005694427": {"Name": "Villers A.", "AuthorID": "7005694427", "AffiliationID": "60072964", "AffiliationName": "UMR8161/CNRS-Institut de Biologie de Lille"}, "56684366100": {"Name": "Olivier J.", "AuthorID": "56684366100", "AffiliationID": "60072964", "AffiliationName": "UMR8161/CNRS-Institut de Biologie de Lille"}, "35336774700": {"Name": "Kasivisvanathan V.", "AuthorID": "35336774700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "7103407519": {"Name": "Puech P.", "AuthorID": "7103407519", "AffiliationID": "108043428", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology"}, "57160366200": {"Name": "Drumez E.", "AuthorID": "57160366200", "AffiliationID": "60104665", "AffiliationName": "Sant\u00e9 Publique, \u00c9pid\u00e9miologie et Qualit\u00e9 des Soins, Department of Biostatistics, Universite Lille"}}}
