The platform we present consists of heterogeneous wireless opportunistic networks of long-range narrowband and short-range broadband communications. We introduce a blockchain-based method by which to verify the record of delivery events on a decentralized network. A new consensus mechanism named proof-of-forwarding (PoF) is proposed to substitute the function of previously proposed proof-of-work (PoW) methods, while significantly improving computational complexities of block generation. Specifically, in our proposal a block is generated exclusively when data delivery agents perform node-to-node direct communication using a short-range high-speed wireless standard to deliver data. We additionally propose a digital signature overlay to prevent malicious nodes from producing fake transactions without any effort to carry data content to recipients. Simulation results show that our blockchain-based framework robustly manages data delivery records, where 97% of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks can be prevented even when half of the entire nodes are assumed to be malicious.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blockchain", "Digital signature", "Heterogeneous network", "Proof-of-forwarding", "Store-carry-forward technique"], "IndexKeywords": ["Broadband Communication", "Database management", "Decentralized networks", "Direct communications", "Distributed denial of service attack", "High speed wireless", "Opportunistic networks", "Store carry forwards"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094110239", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57201557632": {"Name": "Watanabe Y.", "AuthorID": "57201557632", "AffiliationID": "60032325", "AffiliationName": "Social-ICT System Laboratory, National Institute of Information and Communications Technology"}, "56795872700": {"Name": "Liu W.", "AuthorID": "56795872700", "AffiliationID": "60032325", "AffiliationName": "Social-ICT System Laboratory, National Institute of Information and Communications Technology"}, "7103266607": {"Name": "Shoji Y.", "AuthorID": "7103266607", "AffiliationID": "60032325", "AffiliationName": "Social-ICT System Laboratory, National Institute of Information and Communications Technology"}, "56939943000": {"Name": "Abbas A.", "AuthorID": "56939943000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Dept. of Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}, "57207530477": {"Name": "Andreopoulos Y.", "AuthorID": "57207530477", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Dept. of Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}, "7403099468": {"Name": "Hasegawa M.", "AuthorID": "7403099468", "AffiliationID": "60025141", "AffiliationName": "Tokyo University of Science, Dept. of Electrical Engineering"}}}
