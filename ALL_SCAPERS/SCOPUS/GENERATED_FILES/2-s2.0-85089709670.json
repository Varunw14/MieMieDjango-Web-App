A combination of XPS and 57Fe M\u00f6ssbauer data indicate the transition metal cations in the two phases adopt Mn3+/Rh4+ and Fe3+/Rh4+ oxidation state combinations respectively. Transport data indicate both phases are insulating, with \u03c1 vs. T dependences consistent with 3D variable-range hopping. Magnetisation data reveal that La0.5Sr0.5Mn0.5Rh0.5O3 adopts a ferromagnetic state below Tc \u223c 60 K, which is rationalized on the basis of coupling via a dynamic Jahn-Teller distortion mechanism. In contrast, magnetic data reveal La0.5Sr0.5Fe0.5Rh0.5O3 undergoes a transition to a spin-glass state at T \u223c 45 K, attributed to frustration between nearest-neighbour Fe-Rh and next-nearest-neighbour Fe-Fe couplings.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Ferromagnetic state", "Nearest neighbour", "Perovskite oxides", "Perovskite structures", "Spin glass state", "Synchrotron X ray powder diffraction", "Transition metal cations", "Variable range hopping"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089709670", "SubjectAreas": [["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"57204601022": {"Name": "Hasanli N.", "AuthorID": "57204601022", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford, Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory"}, "7102577402": {"Name": "Hayward M.A.", "AuthorID": "7102577402", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford, Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory"}, "57189076314": {"Name": "Scrimshire A.", "AuthorID": "57189076314", "AffiliationID": "60032204", "AffiliationName": "Materials and Engineering Research Institute, Sheffield Hallam University, City Campus"}, "10044102600": {"Name": "Bingham P.A.", "AuthorID": "10044102600", "AffiliationID": "60032204", "AffiliationName": "Materials and Engineering Research Institute, Sheffield Hallam University, City Campus"}, "8227436900": {"Name": "Palgrave R.G.", "AuthorID": "8227436900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
