Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.We investigated the prevalence of reported deep-intronic variants in a French cohort of 70 patients with Stargardt disease harboring a monoallelic pathogenic variant on the exonic regions of ABCA4. Direct Sanger sequencing of selected intronic regions of ABCA4 was conducted. Complete phenotypic analysis and correlation with the genotype was performed in case a known intronic pathogenic variant was identified. All other variants found on the analyzed sequences were queried for minor allele frequency and possible pathogenicity by in silico predictions. The second mutated allele was found in 14 (20%) subjects. The three known deep-intronic variants found were c.5196+1137G>A in intron 36 (6 subjects), c.4539+2064C>T in intron 30 (4 subjects) and c.4253+43G>A in intron 28 (4 subjects). Even though the phenotype depends on the compound effect of the biallelic variants, a genotype-phenotype correlation suggests that the c.5196+1137G>A was mostly associated with a mild phenotype and the c.4539+2064C>T with a more severe one. A variable effect was instead associated with the variant c.4253+43G>A. In addition, two novel variants, c.768+508A>G and c.859-245_859-243delinsTGA never associated with Stargardt disease before, were identified and a possible splice defect was predicted in silico. Our study calls for a larger cohort analysis including targeted locus sequencing and 3D protein modeling to better understand phenotype-genotype correlations associated with deep-intronic changes and patients\u2019 selection for clinical trials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ABCA4", "Deep-intronic variants", "Genotype-phenotype correlation", "Stargardt disease"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters", "Computer Simulation", "Female", "France", "Gene Frequency", "Genetic Association Studies", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Introns", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Phenotype", "Prevalence", "Retrospective Studies", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Stargardt Disease", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073295784", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"56650928500": {"Name": "Nassisi M.", "AuthorID": "56650928500", "AffiliationID": "60004689, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Centre Hospitalier National d\u2019Ophtalmologie des Quinze-Vingts, INSERM-DHOS CIC 1423"}, "57204254747": {"Name": "Mohand-Sa\u00efd S.", "AuthorID": "57204254747", "AffiliationID": "60004689, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Centre Hospitalier National d\u2019Ophtalmologie des Quinze-Vingts, INSERM-DHOS CIC 1423"}, "35326360100": {"Name": "Antonio A.", "AuthorID": "35326360100", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60008134, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, INSERM, CNRS, Institut de la Vision"}, "8976825700": {"Name": "Condroyer C.", "AuthorID": "8976825700", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60008134, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, INSERM, CNRS, Institut de la Vision"}, "57192427597": {"Name": "M\u00e9j\u00e9case C.", "AuthorID": "57192427597", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60008134, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, INSERM, CNRS, Institut de la Vision"}, "57193731162": {"Name": "Varin J.", "AuthorID": "57193731162", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60008134, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, INSERM, CNRS, Institut de la Vision"}, "57211283560": {"Name": "Wohlschlegel J.", "AuthorID": "57211283560", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60008134, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, INSERM, CNRS, Institut de la Vision"}, "57202997924": {"Name": "Sahel J.A.", "AuthorID": "57202997924", "AffiliationID": "60001361", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, The University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine"}, "57210200136": {"Name": "Zeitz C.", "AuthorID": "57210200136", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60008134, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, INSERM, CNRS, Institut de la Vision"}, "6507690222": {"Name": "Audo I.", "AuthorID": "6507690222", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College of London"}, "57203510803": {"Name": "Andrieu C.", "AuthorID": "57203510803", "AffiliationID": "60004689, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Centre Hospitalier National d\u2019Ophtalmologie des Quinze-Vingts, INSERM-DHOS CIC 1423"}, "8681684200": {"Name": "Dhaenens C.M.", "AuthorID": "8681684200", "AffiliationID": "60104665, 60107834", "AffiliationName": "Univ Lille, Inserm UMR-S 1172, CHU Lille, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Department-UF G\u00e9nopathies"}}}
