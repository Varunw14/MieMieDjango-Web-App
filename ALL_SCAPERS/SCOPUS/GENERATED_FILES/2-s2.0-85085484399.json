One aspect of impulsivity\u2014potentially crucial in the obesity context\u2014is reward responsiveness, which may predispose to responsiveness to palatable food cues. The behavioral susceptibility theory hypothesizes that genetic susceptibility to obesity operates partly via genetically determined differences in appetite regulation. Reward responsiveness may therefore be one of the neuro-endophenotypes that mediates genetic susceptibility to obesity. Objective: To test whether reward responsiveness, eating behaviors, and child BMI share common genetic architecture. Methods: We examined reward responsiveness, eating behaviors, and BMI in 5-year-old children from Gemini, a UK birth cohort of 2402 twin pairs born in 2007. All measures were collected by parent report. Reward responsiveness was derived from the Behavioral Approach System. Compulsion to eat and eating for pleasure was measured with the \u201cfood responsiveness\u201d scale of the Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire. Wanting to eat in response to environmental food cues was measured with the \u201cexternal eating\u201d scale of the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire. Maximum-likelihood structural equation modeling was used to establish underlying common genetic and environmental influences. Results: There were significant positive phenotypic correlations between all traits except for reward responsiveness and BMI. Genetic factors explained the majority of the association between food responsiveness and external eating (74%, 95% CI: 61, 87), whereas common shared environmental factors explained the majority of the associations between reward responsiveness with both food responsiveness (55%, 95% CI: 20, 90) and external eating (70%, 95% CI: 39, 100). Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the importance of common environmental factors in the shared etiology between reward responsiveness and childhood eating behaviors. However, the common etiology underlying both reward responsiveness and BMI is unclear, as there was no phenotypic correlation between reward responsiveness and BMI at this age. Further longitudinal research needs to detangle this complex relationship throughout development.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085484399", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"57201267404": {"Name": "Kan C.", "AuthorID": "57201267404", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "57190166382": {"Name": "Herle M.", "AuthorID": "57190166382", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "7006097367": {"Name": "Treasure J.", "AuthorID": "7006097367", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "6701830835": {"Name": "Rijsdijk F.", "AuthorID": "6701830835", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "57208397569": {"Name": "Jones A.", "AuthorID": "57208397569", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Population Health Sciences, University of Liverpool"}, "24471042200": {"Name": "Llewellyn C.", "AuthorID": "24471042200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioral Science and Health, University College London"}}}
