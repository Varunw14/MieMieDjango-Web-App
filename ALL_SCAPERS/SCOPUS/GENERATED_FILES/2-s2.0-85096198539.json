Herein we report poly(hexamethylene biguanide) (PHMB) as a nano-vector for intracellular delivery of plasmid DNA (pDNA) and oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs). PHMB and pDNA or ODNs self-assembled into complex nanoparticles at different pH values (7.4 and 12). Their size, charge, cellular uptake, and gene-expression efficiency are assessed and compared to PEI analogues. The systematic results show that the nanoparticles are effective in delivering plasmid DNA and ODNs to model cell lines in culture (HepG2, HEK293T, HeLa), with measurable changes in gene expression levels, comparable to and, in some conditions, even higher than PEI. The well-accepted safety profile of PHMB makes it a valuable candidate for consideration as an effective intracellular DNA vector for further study and potential clinical translation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gene delivery", "Nanoparticles", "Poly(hexamethylene biguanide) (PHMB)", "Self-assembly"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096198539", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"57200828004": {"Name": "Chivu A.", "AuthorID": "57200828004", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomaterials in Surgical Reconstruction and Regeneration, Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London"}, "57219941157": {"Name": "Mendes G.", "AuthorID": "57219941157", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomaterials in Surgical Reconstruction and Regeneration, Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London"}, "57219939799": {"Name": "An A.", "AuthorID": "57219939799", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomaterials in Surgical Reconstruction and Regeneration, Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London"}, "57219942908": {"Name": "Davidson B.", "AuthorID": "57219942908", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomaterials in Surgical Reconstruction and Regeneration, Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London"}, "7401655806": {"Name": "Song W.", "AuthorID": "7401655806", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomaterials in Surgical Reconstruction and Regeneration, Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London"}, "23501360000": {"Name": "Chindera K.", "AuthorID": "23501360000", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Population Sciences, Royal Veterinary College, Royal College Street"}, "7005608308": {"Name": "Good L.", "AuthorID": "7005608308", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Population Sciences, Royal Veterinary College, Royal College Street"}}}
