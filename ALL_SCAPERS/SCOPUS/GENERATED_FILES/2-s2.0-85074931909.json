The article reports numerical values of the results of the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study, which are reported only graphically and in an aggregated form in the main article. Data include normalised impacts, unaggregated environmental impacts of each life-cycle phase and activity in the foreground system, and results of Monte Carlo simulations. The article also includes data on the carbon intensity of other geothermal studies and alternative energy technologies, which were used for comparison in the associated research article.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carbon intensity", "Environmental impacts", "Geothermal energy", "Life cycle assessment"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074931909", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57203864325": {"Name": "Paulillo A.", "AuthorID": "57203864325", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "6602824221": {"Name": "Striolo A.", "AuthorID": "6602824221", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "35572355100": {"Name": "Lettieri P.", "AuthorID": "35572355100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
