However, transferring structural knowledge to novel environments requires flexible representations that are generalizable over particularities of the current environment, such as its stimuli and size. We suggest that humans represent structural forms as abstract basis sets and that in novel tasks, the structural form is inferred and the relevant basis set is transferred. Using a computational model, we show that such representation allows inference of the underlying structural form, important task states, effective behavioural policies and the existence of unobserved state-trajectories. In two experiments, participants learned three abstract graphs during two successive days. We tested how structural knowledge acquired on Day-1 affected Day-2 performance. In line with our model, participants who had a correct structural prior were able to infer the existence of unobserved state-trajectories and appropriate behavioural policies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cognition", "Decision Making", "Humans", "Knowledge", "Learning", "Models, Theoretical", "Task Performance and Analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091297775", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"36463923700": {"Name": "Mark S.", "AuthorID": "36463923700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging"}, "57194038258": {"Name": "Parr T.", "AuthorID": "57194038258", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging"}, "55542790700": {"Name": "Moran R.", "AuthorID": "55542790700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck UCL Center for Computational Psychiatry and Aging Research"}, "6603245038": {"Name": "Kennerley S.W.", "AuthorID": "6603245038", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience, University College London"}, "8069852700": {"Name": "Behrens T.E.J.", "AuthorID": "8069852700", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
