All rights reserved.Background: Aberrant motor behavior (AMB) is a neuropsychiatric symptom (NPS) prevalent in Alzheimer's disease (AD), known to cause great distress to both patients and caregivers. Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) is the most important genetic predictor of AD, and it has been associated with high NPS prevalence. Objective: To investigate the neuropathological substrates and risk factors associated with AMB in AD patients. Methods: Cases with Braak stage I-II and CERAD 0-1 were classified as Low AD (LAD), while Braak stage III-IV and CERAD 2 were grouped as Intermediate AD (IAD). Cases with Braak stage V-VI and CERAD 3 were classified as High AD (HAD) in accordance with NIA-Reagan criteria. All cases were stratified by APOE genotype, yielding No \u03f54 \u03f54 and \u03f54/\u03f54 groups depending on \u03f54 copy number within APOE. Presence of AMB was assessed using NPI-Q. Results and Conclusion: AMB increased in parallel with CERAD and Braak Braak scores. Hypercholesterolemia, but no other cardiovascular risk factors, was associated with AMB in HAD. AMB prevalence in HAD was significantly increased in the presence of two APOE \u03f54 alleles as compared to No \u03f54 \u03f54. The relationship between homozygous APOE4 and AMB was strongly associated with the presence of both Lewy bodies and cerebral amyloid angiopathy pathologies in both sexes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aberrant motor behavior", "Alzheimer's disease", "APOE gene", "cerebral amyloid angiopathy", "Lewy bodies", "neuropathology", "neuropsychiatric symptoms"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alleles", "Alzheimer Disease", "Apolipoprotein E4", "Brain", "Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy", "Databases, Factual", "Female", "Genotype", "Humans", "Lewy Bodies", "Male", "Movement Disorders"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076583865", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57212394870": {"Name": "Garcia-Segura M.E.", "AuthorID": "57212394870", "AffiliationID": "60085802, 60017018, 60085801", "AffiliationName": "Keenan Research Centre for Biomedical Research, Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute, St. Michaels Hospital"}, "7402486754": {"Name": "Fischer C.E.", "AuthorID": "7402486754", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto"}, "7006754072": {"Name": "Schweizer T.A.", "AuthorID": "7006754072", "AffiliationID": "60017018", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurosurgery, St. Michaels Hospital"}, "7103163183": {"Name": "Munoz D.G.", "AuthorID": "7103163183", "AffiliationID": "60017018", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pathology, St. Michaels Hospital"}}}
