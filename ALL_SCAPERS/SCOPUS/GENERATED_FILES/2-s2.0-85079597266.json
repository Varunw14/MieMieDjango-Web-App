In this work, the mass of the mirrors is reduced by using space approved carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) material and employing micro-fiber composite (MFC) actuators for aberration correction and phase manipulation in an active/adaptive optical mirror system. The carbon fiber mirror is fabricated with 16 layers of prepreg composite MTM44- 1/IMS65 carbon fiber and one layer of polishable resin. The layers are cured under pressure in an autoclave machine in a pressure and temperature-controlled environment. 2 different piezoelectric actuators, Push actuators and MFC actuators, are tested and the phase shift, form factor and surface deformation due to the active actuators are compared. Push actuators are the most common means of active optics. CFRP structure and surface deformation after actuator's effect are investigated theoretically using finite element analysis with the aid of COMSOL software and by optical experiments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aberration correction", "Active optics", "Adaptive optics", "Autoclave", "Carbon fiber", "CFRP", "Cryogenic temperature", "CTE", "MFC", "Piezoelectric actuator"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aberration correction", "Active Optics", "Atmospheric aberration", "Carbon fiber reinforced polymer", "Controlled environment", "Cryogenic temperatures", "Piezoeletric actuators", "Pressure and temperature"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079597266", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"25930251000": {"Name": "Baghsiahi H.", "AuthorID": "25930251000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Physics and Astronomy, University College"}, "7403482947": {"Name": "Brooks D.", "AuthorID": "7403482947", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Physics and Astronomy, University College"}, "6506833394": {"Name": "Doel P.", "AuthorID": "6506833394", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Physics and Astronomy, University College"}, "56677095800": {"Name": "Jones M.", "AuthorID": "56677095800", "AffiliationID": "60104726", "AffiliationName": "Glyndwr Innovation and Composite Centre, Glyndwr University"}}}
