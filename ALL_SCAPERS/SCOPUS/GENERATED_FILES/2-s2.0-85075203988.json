KGaA, WeinheimThe room temperature synthesis of perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) is typically achieved by employing a ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP) method, which can be handled in air, and its products are comparable to what is obtained using the traditional hot-injection method. However, the LARP method typically requires the use of coordinating polar solvents such as dimethylformamide, which are not appropriate for large-scale production due to toxicity concerns and can also degrade or form defective perovskite NCs. Herein, an amine and oleic-acid-free room temperature synthesis of lead bromide perovskite NCs is reported that uses a combination of trioctylphosphine oxide and diisooctylphosphinic acid ligands. This combination of ligands provides a stable platform for the polar-solvent-free synthesis in air of fully inorganic CsPbBr3 (fwhm \u2248 14 nm, emission = 519 nm) and hybrid organic-inorganic FAPbBr3 (fwhm \u2248 19 nm) NCs with photoluminescence emission between 530 and 535 nm, which is in line with the Rec. 2020 color standards. In addition, it is shown that compared to a traditionally used ligand combination, phosphine ligands can be easily removed from the surface of the NCs, which is important for the future development of this technology in optoelectronic devices.", "AuthorKeywords": ["nanocrystals", "perovskites", "phosphine ligands", "room temperature synthesis", "surface chemistry"], "IndexKeywords": ["Coordinating solvents", "Hybrid organic-inorganic", "Large scale productions", "Nanocrystal (NCs)", "Phosphine ligands", "Photoluminescence emission", "Room temperature synthesis", "Trioctylphosphine oxide"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075203988", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57189464207": {"Name": "Ambroz F.", "AuthorID": "57189464207", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57213083930": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "57213083930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56210619300": {"Name": "Macdonald T.J.", "AuthorID": "56210619300", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Center for Plastic Electronics, Molecular Science Research, Imperial College London"}, "57212335110": {"Name": "Xu W.", "AuthorID": "57212335110", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Center for Plastic Electronics, Molecular Science Research, Imperial College London"}, "57194687776": {"Name": "Lin C.T.", "AuthorID": "57194687776", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials and Center for Plastic Electronics, Imperial College London"}, "57209436449": {"Name": "Contini C.", "AuthorID": "57209436449", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Center for Plastic Electronics, Molecular Science Research, Imperial College London"}, "57207806454": {"Name": "Durrant J.R.", "AuthorID": "57207806454", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "SPECIFIC, College of Engineering, Swansea University"}, "36664352000": {"Name": "Gadipelli S.", "AuthorID": "36664352000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.J.L.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005745335": {"Name": "McLachlan M.A.", "AuthorID": "7005745335", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials and Center for Plastic Electronics, Imperial College London"}}}
