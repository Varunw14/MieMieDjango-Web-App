All rights reserved.Adaptive radiation plays a fundamental role in our understanding of the evolutionary process. However, the concept has provoked strong and differing opinions concerning its definition and nature among researchers studying a wide diversity of systems. Here, we take a broad view of what constitutes an adaptive radiation, and seek to find commonalities among disparate examples, ranging from plants to invertebrate and vertebrate animals, and remote islands to lakes and continents, to better understand processes shared across adaptive radiations. We surveyed many groups to evaluate factors considered important in a large variety of species radiations. In each of these studies, ecological opportunity of some form is identified as a prerequisite for adaptive radiation. However, evolvability, which can be enhanced by hybridization between distantly related species, may play a role in seeding entire radiations. Within radiations, the processes that lead to speciation depend largely on (1) whether the primary drivers of ecological shifts are (a) external to the membership of the radiation itself (mostly divergent or disruptive ecological selection) or (b) due to competition within the radiation membership (interactions among members) subsequent to reproductive isolation in similar environments, and (2) the extent and timing of admixture. These differences translate into different patterns of species accumulation and subsequent patterns of diversity across an adaptive radiation. Adaptive radiations occur in an extraordinary diversity of different ways, and continue to provide rich data for a better understanding of the diversification of life.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079019127", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"7102158431": {"Name": "Gillespie R.G.", "AuthorID": "7102158431", "AffiliationID": "60121458, 60025038", "AffiliationName": "University of California, Berkeley, Essig Museum of Entomology, Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management"}, "16835819500": {"Name": "Bennett G.M.", "AuthorID": "16835819500", "AffiliationID": "60009164", "AffiliationName": "University of California Merced, Life and Environmental Sciences Unit"}, "7004998563": {"Name": "De Meester L.", "AuthorID": "7004998563", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "University of Leuven, Laboratory of Aquatic Ecology, Evolution and Conservation"}, "7103319673": {"Name": "Feder J.L.", "AuthorID": "7103319673", "AffiliationID": "60021508", "AffiliationName": "University of Notre Dame, Dept. of Biological Sciences"}, "7101789259": {"Name": "Fleischer R.C.", "AuthorID": "7101789259", "AffiliationID": "60030112", "AffiliationName": "Center for Conservation Genomics, Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute, National Zoological Park"}, "7004753639": {"Name": "Harmon L.J.", "AuthorID": "7004753639", "AffiliationID": "60033389", "AffiliationName": "University of Idaho, Dept. of Biological Sciences"}, "7101656570": {"Name": "Hendry A.P.", "AuthorID": "7101656570", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "McGill University, Redpath Museum"}, "6504654507": {"Name": "Knope M.L.", "AuthorID": "6504654507", "AffiliationID": "60014837", "AffiliationName": "University of Hawaii at Hilo, Dept. of Biology"}, "7202284097": {"Name": "Mallet J.", "AuthorID": "7202284097", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Harvard University"}, "56680456700": {"Name": "Martin C.", "AuthorID": "56680456700", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "University of California Berkeley, Integrative Biology and Museum of Vertebrate Zoology"}, "14045647700": {"Name": "Parent C.E.", "AuthorID": "14045647700", "AffiliationID": "60033389", "AffiliationName": "University of Idaho, Biological Sciences"}, "57201127124": {"Name": "Patton A.H.", "AuthorID": "57201127124", "AffiliationID": "60018208", "AffiliationName": "Washington State University, School of Biological Sciences"}, "6603451017": {"Name": "Pfennig K.S.", "AuthorID": "6603451017", "AffiliationID": "60025111", "AffiliationName": "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Department of Biology"}, "6602370528": {"Name": "Rubinoff D.", "AuthorID": "6602370528", "AffiliationID": "60013791", "AffiliationName": "University of Hawaii at Manoa, Department of Plant and Environmental Protection Sciences"}, "7006035288": {"Name": "Schluter D.", "AuthorID": "7006035288", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "University of British Columbia"}, "57207566950": {"Name": "Seehausen O.", "AuthorID": "57207566950", "AffiliationID": "112110547", "AffiliationName": "Center for Ecology Evolution and Biogeochemistry"}, "57203075382": {"Name": "Shaw K.L.", "AuthorID": "57203075382", "AffiliationID": "60007776", "AffiliationName": "Cornell University, Neurobiology and Behavior"}, "6602198586": {"Name": "Stacy E.", "AuthorID": "6602198586", "AffiliationID": "60031892", "AffiliationName": "University of Nevada Las Vegas, School of Life Sciences"}, "8596255400": {"Name": "Stervander M.", "AuthorID": "8596255400", "AffiliationID": "60012317", "AffiliationName": "University of Oregon, Institute of Ecology and Evolution"}, "56290621900": {"Name": "Stroud J.T.", "AuthorID": "56290621900", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Washington University in Saint Louis, Biology"}, "26434992900": {"Name": "Wagner C.", "AuthorID": "26434992900", "AffiliationID": "60008827", "AffiliationName": "University of Wyoming, Department of Botany"}, "36459338600": {"Name": "Wogan G.O.U.", "AuthorID": "36459338600", "AffiliationID": "60121458, 60025038", "AffiliationName": "University of California Berkeley, Environmental Science Policy, and Management"}}}
