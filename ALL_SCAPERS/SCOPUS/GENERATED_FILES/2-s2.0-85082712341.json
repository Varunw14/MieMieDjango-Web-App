Neuro-oncology surgery would especially benefit from detailed real-time in vivo tissue characterisation, improving the accuracy with which boundaries of safe surgical resection are delineated and thereby improving patient outcomes. Current systems are limited by challenges with processing the HSI data because of incomplete characterisation of the optical properties of tissue across the complete visible and near-infrared wavelength spectrum. In this study, we characterised the optical properties of various freshly-excised brain tumours and normal cadaveric human brain tissue using a dual-beam integrating sphere spectrophotometer and the inverse adding-doubling technique. We adapted an integrating sphere to analyse 2 mm-thick tissue samples measuring 4-7 mm in diameter and validated the experimental setup with a tissue-mimicking optical phantom. We investigated the different spectral signatures of freshly-excised tumour tissues including pituitary adenoma, meningioma and vestibular schwannoma and compared these to normal grey and white matter, pons, pituitary, dura and cranial nerve tissues across the wavelength range of 400-1800 nm. It was found that brain and tumour tissues could be differentiated by their optical properties but the freezing process did alter the tissues' relative absorption and reduced scattering coefficients. In this work, we have demonstrated a method to characterise the optical properties of small human brain and tumour specimens that may be used as a reference dataset for developing optical imaging techniques.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Absorption", "Brain", "Meningioma", "Optical properties", "Pituitary adenoma", "Scattering", "Tissue characterisation", "Vestibular schwannoma"], "IndexKeywords": ["Inverse adding-doubling", "Meningiomas", "Optical characteristics", "Optical imaging technique", "Pituitary adenoma", "Reduced scattering coefficients", "Vestibular schwannoma", "Visible and near infrared"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082712341", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"36983191400": {"Name": "Shapey J.", "AuthorID": "36983191400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "56038489100": {"Name": "Maneas E.", "AuthorID": "56038489100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57204519454": {"Name": "Desjardins A.E.", "AuthorID": "57204519454", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7102086722": {"Name": "Saeed S.R.", "AuthorID": "7102086722", "AffiliationID": "60029890", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital, London"}, "6701868395": {"Name": "Dorward N.", "AuthorID": "6701868395", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7005286729": {"Name": "Kitchen N.", "AuthorID": "7005286729", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7103114022": {"Name": "Bradford R.", "AuthorID": "7103114022", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "55566629600": {"Name": "Xie Y.", "AuthorID": "55566629600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "56619274200": {"Name": "Nabavi E.", "AuthorID": "56619274200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "57193152354": {"Name": "Ebner M.", "AuthorID": "57193152354", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "23010613000": {"Name": "Vercauteren T.", "AuthorID": "23010613000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "54083212800": {"Name": "Jaunmuktane Z.", "AuthorID": "54083212800", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropathology, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57203291731": {"Name": "Brandner S.", "AuthorID": "57203291731", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropathology, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
