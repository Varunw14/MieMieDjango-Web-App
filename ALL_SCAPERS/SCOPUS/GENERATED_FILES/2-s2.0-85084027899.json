OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the current literature assessing the factors influencing the variability of mpMRI performance in csPCa diagnosis. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A computerized bibliographic search of Medline/PubMed database was performed for all studies assessing magnetic field strength, use of an endorectal coil, assessment system used by radiologists and inter-reader variability, experience of radiologists and urologists, use of a contrast agent, and use of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools in relation to mpMRI diagnostic accuracy. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: A total of 77 articles were included. Both radiologists' reading experience and urologists'/radiologists' biopsy experience were the main factors that influenced diagnostic accuracy. Therefore, it is mandatory to indicate the experience of the interpreting radiologists and biopsy-performing urologists to support the reliability of the findings. The most recent Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) guidelines are recommended for use as the main assessment system for csPCa, given the simplified and standardized approach as well as its particular added value for less experienced radiologists. Biparametric MRI had similar accuracy to mpMRI; however, biparametric MRI performed better with experienced readers. The limited data available suggest that the combination of CAD and radiologist readings may influence diagnostic accuracy positively. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple factors affect the accuracy of mpMRI and MRI-targeted biopsy to detect and localize csPCa. The high heterogeneity across the studies underlines the need to define the experience of radiologists and urologists, implement quality control, and adhere to the most recent PI-RADS assessment guidelines. Further research is needed to clarify which factors impact the accuracy of the MRI pathway and how. PATIENT SUMMARY: We systematically reported the factors influencing the accuracy of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) in detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). These factors are significantly related to each other, with the experience of the radiologists being the dominating factor. In order to deliver the benefits of mpMRI to diagnose csPCa, it is necessary to develop expertise for both radiologists and urologists, implement quality control, and adhere to the most recent Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System assessment guidelines.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diagnosis, Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Prostate cancer", "Targeted biopsy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Male", "Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Prostatic Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084027899", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"57169977600": {"Name": "Stabile A.", "AuthorID": "57169977600", "AffiliationID": "60009622, 60082964", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology and Division of Experimental Oncology, Urological Research Institute, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"}, "55646665800": {"Name": "Giganti F.", "AuthorID": "55646665800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": null}, "35336774700": {"Name": "Kasivisvanathan V.", "AuthorID": "35336774700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": null}, "7402982572": {"Name": "Moore C.M.", "AuthorID": "7402982572", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": null}, "55883317500": {"Name": "Giannarini G.", "AuthorID": "55883317500", "AffiliationID": "60009513", "AffiliationName": "Urology Unit, Academic Medical Centre, Santa Maria della Misericordia Hospital"}, "7003945883": {"Name": "Padhani A.R.", "AuthorID": "7003945883", "AffiliationID": "60006776", "AffiliationName": "Paul Strickland Scanner Centre, Mount Vernon Cancer Centre"}, "7003270861": {"Name": "Panebianco V.", "AuthorID": "7003270861", "AffiliationID": "60032350, 60023359", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Sapienza Rome University"}, "35175068900": {"Name": "Rosenkrantz A.B.", "AuthorID": "35175068900", "AffiliationID": "60032105", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, NYU Langone Health"}, "22635516900": {"Name": "Salomon G.", "AuthorID": "22635516900", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Prostate Cancer Center, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf"}, "9435311800": {"Name": "Turkbey B.", "AuthorID": "9435311800", "AffiliationID": "60013409, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Imaging Program, National Cancer Institute, NIH, MD"}, "6603327960": {"Name": "Villeirs G.", "AuthorID": "6603327960", "AffiliationID": "60068590", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Ghent University Hospital"}, "7006484477": {"Name": "Barentsz J.O.", "AuthorID": "7006484477", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Radboud University Medical Center"}}}
