The theory informing the selection of BCTs for an intervention may be stated explicitly or remain unreported, thus impeding the identification of links between theory and behavior change outcomes. Purpose This study aimed to identify groups of BCTs commonly occurring together in behavior change interventions and examine whether behavior change theories underlying these groups could be identified. Methods The study involved three phases: (a) a factor analysis to identify groups of co-occurring BCTs from 277 behavior change intervention reports; (b) examining expert consensus (n = 25) about links between BCT groups and behavioral theories; (c) a comparison of the expert-linked theories with theories explicitly mentioned by authors of the 277 intervention reports. Results Five groups of co-occurring BCTs (range: 3-13 BCTs per group) were identified through factor analysis. Experts agreed on five links (\u226580% of experts), comprising three BCT groups and five behavior change theories. Four of the five BCT group-theory links agreed by experts were also stated by study authors in intervention reports using similar groups of BCTs. Conclusions It is possible to identify groups of BCTs frequently used together in interventions. Experts made shared inferences about behavior change theory underlying these BCT groups, suggesting that it may be possible to propose a theoretical basis for interventions where authors do not explicitly put forward a theory. These results advance our understanding of theory use in multicomponent interventions and build the evidence base for further understanding theory-based intervention development and evaluation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Behavior change theory", "Intervention design", "Intervention evaluation", "Multicomponent intervention"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095862231", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57204799939": {"Name": "Bohlen L.C.", "AuthorID": "57204799939", "AffiliationID": "60011460", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioral and Social Sciences, Brown University School of Public Health"}, "57219963606": {"Name": "DPhil S.M.", "AuthorID": "57219963606", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "57206269087": {"Name": "Groarke H.N.K.", "AuthorID": "57206269087", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "55454490500": {"Name": "Carey R.N.", "AuthorID": "55454490500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "57219875994": {"Name": "Hale J.", "AuthorID": "57219875994", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "8583633000": {"Name": "de Bruin M.", "AuthorID": "8583633000", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Radboud University Medical Center, Radboud Institute of Health Sciences"}, "7402060418": {"Name": "Johnston M.", "AuthorID": "7402060418", "AffiliationID": "60015875", "AffiliationName": "Aberdeen Health Psychology Group, Institute of Applied Health Sciences, College of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Aberdeen"}, "7103401959": {"Name": "Rothman A.J.", "AuthorID": "7103401959", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Minnesota"}, "57040355200": {"Name": "Kelly M.P.", "AuthorID": "57040355200", "AffiliationID": "60009587, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge"}}}
