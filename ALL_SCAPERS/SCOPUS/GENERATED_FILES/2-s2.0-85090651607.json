However, the existing academic work focuses largely on corruption in government. Yet, corporations play a key role in much of the corruption that occurs in society and are important contexts for corruption themselves; they are also very different from governments and, we argue, deserve focused study and the development of a coherent theory of corporate corruption. In this article, we define corporate corruption and argue that management researchers are uniquely positioned to contribute to the development of a theory of corporate corruption and the development of solutions to prevent it. We then examine the current state of research on this important topic and propose a framework for organizing research on corporate corruption into four per-spectives: corporate corruption as rational action, corporate corruption as institutional-ized practice, corporate corruption as cultural norm, and corporate corruption as moral failure. We go on to propose a research agenda for management scholars in some tradi-tional areas of management research to take this important but under-researched topic forward, as well as highlight some of the methodological challenges that management researchers face in conducting research in corporate corruption.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090651607", "SubjectAreas": [["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management", "BUSI", "1407"]], "AuthorData": {"57195717968": {"Name": "Castro A.", "AuthorID": "57195717968", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7201973206": {"Name": "Phillips N.", "AuthorID": "7201973206", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London"}, "57218901896": {"Name": "Ansari S.", "AuthorID": "57218901896", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge"}}}
