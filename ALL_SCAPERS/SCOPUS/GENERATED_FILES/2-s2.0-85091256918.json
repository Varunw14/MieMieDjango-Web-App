Objectives: In this paper we present three different experiments to provide a comprehensive picture of whether adults can learn complex routes consisting of a number of choicepoints, and if so, what strategies they might be employing to do so. Method: and results We found that adults could learn a 15-junction route after only a single experience of the route (Experiment 1) but that they underestimated how good they would be at learning the 15-junction route (Experiment 2). In Experiment 3, we found that when learning a route made up of \u201cT\u201d shaped junctions, participants relied on a \u201cbeacon\u201d strategy based on visual matching. Conclusions: Collectively, these findings suggest that adults can learn complex routes, even with as many as 15 choicepoints, very quickly and without the need for repeated exposure. These findings have implications for theories of wayfinding and call into question the need for repeated exposure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Landmarks", "Route learning", "Strategies", "Virtual environments", "Visual matching", "Wayfinding"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091256918", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"]], "AuthorData": {"56433368200": {"Name": "Lingwood J.", "AuthorID": "56433368200", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Department of Linguistics and Phonetics, School of Languages, Cultures, and Societies, University of Leeds"}, "6602319057": {"Name": "Farran E.K.", "AuthorID": "6602319057", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Surrey, Surrey"}, "22034531800": {"Name": "Courbois Y.", "AuthorID": "22034531800", "AffiliationID": "60107872, 60104665", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Lille, ULR 4072 - PSITEC - Psychologie : interactions temps \u00e9motions Cognition"}, "7006826263": {"Name": "Blades M.", "AuthorID": "7006826263", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Sheffield, Sheffield"}}}
