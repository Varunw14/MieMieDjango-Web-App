Nevertheless, characterizing SVs and determining the optimal approach for a given experimental design remains a computational and scientific challenge. Multiple approaches have emerged to target various SV classes, zygosities, and size ranges. Here, we review these approaches with respect to their ability to infer SVs across the full spectrum of large, complex variations and present computational methods for each approach.", "AuthorKeywords": ["De novo assembly", "Gene fusion", "Hybrid", "Long-read", "Mapping", "RNA-Seq", "Short-read", "Structural variant (SV) detection"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Genomic Structural Variation", "Genomics", "Humans"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075428027", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57210461513": {"Name": "Mahmoud M.", "AuthorID": "57210461513", "AffiliationID": "60002441", "AffiliationName": "Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine"}, "55246029800": {"Name": "Sedlazeck F.J.", "AuthorID": "55246029800", "AffiliationID": "60002441", "AffiliationName": "Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine"}, "57211533450": {"Name": "Gobet N.", "AuthorID": "57211533450", "AffiliationID": "60026285", "AffiliationName": "Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics"}, "11739647400": {"Name": "Dessimoz C.", "AuthorID": "11739647400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "57191250166": {"Name": "Cruz-D\u00e1valos D.I.", "AuthorID": "57191250166", "AffiliationID": "60000239", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computational Biology, University of Lausanne"}, "57205441074": {"Name": "Mounier N.", "AuthorID": "57205441074", "AffiliationID": "60000239", "AffiliationName": "University Center for Primary Care and Public Health"}}}
