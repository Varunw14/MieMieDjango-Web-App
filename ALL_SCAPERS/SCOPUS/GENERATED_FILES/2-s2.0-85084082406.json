However, recent studies1 motivated by observations by Purcell2 have shown how radiative emission into a microwave cavity can become the dominant relaxation path for spins if the spin\u2013cavity coupling is sufficiently large (such as for small-mode-volume cavities). In this regime, the cavity electromagnetic field overrides the lattice as the dominant environment, inviting the prospect of controlling the spin temperature independently from that of the lattice, by engineering a suitable cavity field. Here, we report on precisely such control over spin temperature, illustrating a novel and universal method to increase the electron spin polarization above its thermal equilibrium value (termed hyperpolarization). By switching the cavity input between resistive loads at different temperatures we can control the electron spin polarization, cooling it below the lattice temperature. Our demonstration uses donor spins in silicon coupled to a superconducting microresonator and we observe more than a twofold increase in spin polarization. This approach provides a general route to signal enhancement in electron spin resonance, or nuclear magnetic resonance through dynamical nuclear spin polarization3,4.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Electron spin polarization", "Hyperpolarization", "Lattice temperatures", "Nuclear-spin polarization", "Radiative emissions", "Signal enhancement", "Superconducting microresonator", "Thermal equilibriums"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084082406", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57197725931": {"Name": "Albanese B.", "AuthorID": "57197725931", "AffiliationID": "60106017, 60106256, 60008134, 60007816", "AffiliationName": "Quantronics Group, SPEC, CEA, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay"}, "55386255600": {"Name": "Probst S.", "AuthorID": "55386255600", "AffiliationID": "60106017, 60106256, 60008134, 60007816", "AffiliationName": "Quantronics Group, SPEC, CEA, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay"}, "7003911307": {"Name": "Ranjan V.", "AuthorID": "7003911307", "AffiliationID": "60106017, 60106256, 60008134, 60007816", "AffiliationName": "Quantronics Group, SPEC, CEA, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay"}, "6603574926": {"Name": "Vion D.", "AuthorID": "6603574926", "AffiliationID": "60106017, 60106256, 60008134, 60007816", "AffiliationName": "Quantronics Group, SPEC, CEA, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay"}, "7004471792": {"Name": "Esteve D.", "AuthorID": "7004471792", "AffiliationID": "60106017, 60106256, 60008134, 60007816", "AffiliationName": "Quantronics Group, SPEC, CEA, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay"}, "36782220500": {"Name": "Flurin E.", "AuthorID": "36782220500", "AffiliationID": "60106017, 60106256, 60008134, 60007816", "AffiliationName": "Quantronics Group, SPEC, CEA, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay"}, "6602493551": {"Name": "Bertet P.", "AuthorID": "6602493551", "AffiliationID": "60106017, 60106256, 60008134, 60007816", "AffiliationName": "Quantronics Group, SPEC, CEA, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay"}, "55880399400": {"Name": "Zollitsch C.W.", "AuthorID": "55880399400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "55613970800": {"Name": "Morton J.J.L.", "AuthorID": "55613970800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "55194764700": {"Name": "Pechal M.", "AuthorID": "55194764700", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, ETH Zurich"}, "6701667518": {"Name": "Wallraff A.", "AuthorID": "6701667518", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, ETH Zurich"}}}
