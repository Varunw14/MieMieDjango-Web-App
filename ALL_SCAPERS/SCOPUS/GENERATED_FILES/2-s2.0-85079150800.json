We determined how the use of HT and RTB changed in response to clinical guidelines and whether the benefit of routine RTB was still observed in the HT era. Materials and methods: Between 1996 and 2004, a provincial database identified all women \u226440 years with breast cancer who met the inclusion criteria of the EORTC trial. In total, 411 patients were classified into three eras defined by the guidelines: era 1 (discretionary HT, discretionary RTB); era 2 (routine HT, discretionary RTB); era 3 (routine HT, routine RTB). HT use, RTB use and cumulative incidence of local recurrence were calculated and compared across eras. Results: HT use increased after the first policy change from 13% to 75% for oestrogen receptor-positive patients (P < 0.01). RTB use also increased from 33% to 76% following the second policy change (P < 0.01). At 10 years, the cumulative incidence of local recurrence was 12% in era 1, 6% in era 2 and 6% in era 3 (era 2 versus era 3, P = 0.92). For patients in the routine HT era (eras 2 and 3 combined) there was no significant difference in local recurrence between RTB and \u2018no RTB\u2019 patients (6% versus 7%, P = 0.81). Conclusions: The routine use of HT and RTB increased significantly after new practice guidelines. Introduction of the HT guideline was associated with a 6% improvement in local recurrence at 10 years. No improvement in local recurrence was associated with the introduction of the RTB guideline in the HT era. The routine use of a boost in unselected young women with negative margins should be re-evaluated in the current HT era.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Breast cancer", "breast-conserving therapy", "hormone therapy", "local recurrence", "radiotherapy tumour bed boost"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079150800", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57206244621": {"Name": "Beaton L.", "AuthorID": "57206244621", "AffiliationID": "60028379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, BC Cancer"}, "9637398200": {"Name": "Chan E.K.", "AuthorID": "9637398200", "AffiliationID": "60028379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, BC Cancer"}, "55894281300": {"Name": "Tyldesley S.", "AuthorID": "55894281300", "AffiliationID": "60028379", "AffiliationName": "Breast Cancer Outcomes Unit, BC Cancer"}, "8693430700": {"Name": "Nichol A.", "AuthorID": "8693430700", "AffiliationID": "60028379", "AffiliationName": "Breast Cancer Outcomes Unit, BC Cancer"}, "56162358000": {"Name": "Gondara L.", "AuthorID": "56162358000", "AffiliationID": "60028379", "AffiliationName": "Breast Cancer Outcomes Unit, BC Cancer"}, "6603603351": {"Name": "Speers C.", "AuthorID": "6603603351", "AffiliationID": "60028379", "AffiliationName": "Breast Cancer Outcomes Unit, BC Cancer"}}}
