In this case, the solution does not satisfy the Bellman equation. Our approach consists of studying a recursive Lagrangian. Under standard general conditions, there is a recursive saddle-point functional equation (analogous to a Bellman equation) that characterizes a recursive solution to the planner's problem. The recursive formulation is obtained after adding a co-state variable \u03bct summarizing previous commitments reflected in past Lagrange multipliers. The continuation problem is obtained with \u03bct playing the role of weights in the objective function. Our approach is applicable to characterizing and computing solutions to a large class of dynamic contracting problems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bellman equations", "dynamic optimization", "Lagrangian multipliers", "limited commitment", "limited enforcement", "Ramsey equilibrium", "Recursive methods", "saddle-points", "time inconsistency"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073376658", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"6505918685": {"Name": "Marcet A.", "AuthorID": "6505918685", "AffiliationID": "100836516", "AffiliationName": "CEPR"}, "6602762025": {"Name": "Marimon R.", "AuthorID": "6602762025", "AffiliationID": "60020337", "AffiliationName": "NBER"}}}
