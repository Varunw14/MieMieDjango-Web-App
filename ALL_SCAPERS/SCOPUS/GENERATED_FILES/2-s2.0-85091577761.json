Among prostaglandins (PGs), prostacyclin (PGI2) and PGE2 are strongly involved in the regulation of homeostasis and main physiologic functions. In addi- tion, the synthesis of these two prostaglandins is significantly increased during inflammation. PGI2 and PGE2 exert their biologic actions by binding to their respective receptors, namely prostacyclin receptor (IP) and prostaglandin E2 receptor (EP) 1-4, which belong to the family of G-protein-coupled receptors. IP and EP1-4 receptors are widely distributed in the body and thus play various physiologic and pathophysiologic roles. In this review, we discuss the recent advances in studies using pharmacological approaches, genetically modified animals, and genome-wide association studies regarding the roles of IP and EP1-4 receptors in the immune, cardiovascular, nervous, gastrointestinal, respiratory, genitourinary, and musculoskeletal systems. In particular, we highlight similarities and differences between human and rodents in terms of the specific roles of IP and EP1-4 receptors and their downstream signaling pathways, functions, and activities for each biologic system. We also highlight the potential novel therapeutic benefit of targeting IP and EP1-4 receptors in several diseases based on the scientific advances, animal models, and human studies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091577761", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"7004105096": {"Name": "Norel X.", "AuthorID": "7004105096", "AffiliationID": "60009647", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Sorbonne Paris Nord"}, "55775632600": {"Name": "Ozen G.", "AuthorID": "55775632600", "AffiliationID": "60028502", "AffiliationName": "Istanbul University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmacology"}, "57211715337": {"Name": "Abdelazeem H.", "AuthorID": "57211715337", "AffiliationID": "60033041", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Alexandria University"}, "57190069028": {"Name": "Amgoud Y.", "AuthorID": "57190069028", "AffiliationID": "60009647", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Sorbonne Paris Nord"}, "57211711000": {"Name": "Bouhadoun A.", "AuthorID": "57211711000", "AffiliationID": "60009647", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Sorbonne Paris Nord"}, "57211688993": {"Name": "Mani S.", "AuthorID": "57211688993", "AffiliationID": "60070635, 60050038", "AffiliationName": "Institut Sup\u00e9rieur de Biotechnologie de Monastir (ISBM), Universit\u00e9 de Monastir"}, "57218127808": {"Name": "Manikpurage H.D.", "AuthorID": "57218127808", "AffiliationID": "60000905, 60022785, 60123697", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Paris, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), UMR-S 1148 CHU X.
