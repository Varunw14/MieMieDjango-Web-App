However, up to now, due to many challenges in design and practical implementation, demonstrated data rates of DP-NFDM transmission systems in experiments are still much lower than the record data rate of single polarisation NFDM transmissions (125 Gb/s). In this work, by employing the concept of b-modulation and developing effective digital signal processing (DSP), we have experimentally demonstrated for the first time a high capacity DP-NFDM transmission system, achieving a net data rate of 220 Gbps with spectral efficiency (SE) of 4 bits/s/Hz.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Non-linear Fourier transform", "non-linear frequency-division multiplexing", "non-linear transmission scheme"], "IndexKeywords": ["Data rates", "Digital signal processing (DSP)", "Experimental demonstrations", "High capacity", "Non linear", "Nonlinear frequency", "Spectral efficiencies", "Transmission systems"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075903741", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"]], "AuthorData": {"57194379345": {"Name": "Yangzhang X.", "AuthorID": "57194379345", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College London"}, "57110068500": {"Name": "Lavery D.", "AuthorID": "57110068500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College London"}, "7005053644": {"Name": "Bayvel P.", "AuthorID": "7005053644", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College London"}, "36160408500": {"Name": "Le S.T.", "AuthorID": "36160408500", "AffiliationID": "60021378", "AffiliationName": "Nokia Bell Labs"}, "30867529700": {"Name": "Aref V.", "AuthorID": "30867529700", "AffiliationID": "60021378", "AffiliationName": "Nokia Bell Labs"}, "57216639276": {"Name": "Buelow H.", "AuthorID": "57216639276", "AffiliationID": "60021378", "AffiliationName": "Nokia Bell Labs"}}}
