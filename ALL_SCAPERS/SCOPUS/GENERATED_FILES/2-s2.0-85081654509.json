In this light, the present work wishes to provide a multi-level analysis of the sustainability in CH, using as an example a recent European H2020 project (CrossCult) and the lessons learnt from its design, implementation and evaluation. The sustainability of CH has qualitatively changed over the last few years, under the developments in digital technology that seems to affect the very nature of the cultural experience. We discuss sustainability in venues using digital technologies, covering a span of needs of small/unknown and large/popular venues, which try to enhance the visitor experience, attract visitors, form venue networks, etc. Moreover, we explore issues of sustainability of digital content and its re usability through holistic design. Aspects of technology, human networks and data sustainability are also presented, and we conclude with the arguments concerning the sustainability of visitor reflection, the interpretation of social and historical phenomena and the creation of meaning.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cultural heritage", "Digital humanities", "Storytelling", "Sustainability"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081654509", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"56241323100": {"Name": "Kontiza K.", "AuthorID": "56241323100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information Studies, University College London"}, "24469699600": {"Name": "Antoniou A.", "AuthorID": "24469699600", "AffiliationID": "115805299", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, University of the Peloponnese"}, "57198500066": {"Name": "Daif A.", "AuthorID": "57198500066", "AffiliationID": "60122095, 60026134", "AffiliationName": "AtlantTIC Research Center, Department of Telematics Engineering, University of Vigo"}, "35614992300": {"Name": "L\u00f3pez-Nores M.", "AuthorID": "35614992300", "AffiliationID": "60122095, 60026134", "AffiliationName": "AtlantTIC Research Center, Department of Telematics Engineering, University of Vigo"}, "57192540084": {"Name": "Reboreda-Morillo S.", "AuthorID": "57192540084", "AffiliationID": "60026134", "AffiliationName": "Group of Studies in Archaeology, Antiquity and Territory, University of Vigo"}, "57192655690": {"Name": "Gonz\u00e1lez-Soutelo S.", "AuthorID": "57192655690", "AffiliationID": "60026796", "AffiliationName": "Department of Prehistory and Archaeology, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid/MIAS"}, "57202446278": {"Name": "Bassani M.", "AuthorID": "57202446278", "AffiliationID": "60015466", "AffiliationName": "Study Center classicA, Universit\u00e0 Iuav di Venezia"}, "14632238500": {"Name": "Lykourentzou I.", "AuthorID": "14632238500", "AffiliationID": "60007989", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information and Computing Sciences, Utrecht University"}, "57212989368": {"Name": "Jones C.E.", "AuthorID": "57212989368", "AffiliationID": "60072562", "AffiliationName": "University of Luxembourg"}, "56048712200": {"Name": "Padfield J.", "AuthorID": "56048712200", "AffiliationID": "100338346", "AffiliationName": "Research Department, The National Gallery"}}}
