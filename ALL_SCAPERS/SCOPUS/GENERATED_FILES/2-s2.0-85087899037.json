Action plans aiming at fighting traffic noise often take a long time to reach mature implementation. Therefore, it is advantageous to envisage how societal and urban changes and associated changes in mobility practices will modify the urban sound environment of tomorrow. In this article, an interdisciplinary team of seven researchers, whose work focuses on different fields of acoustics and mobility, reviews the potential impact of ongoing mobility and society changes on sound environments. First, the team identified the trends dealing with urban renewal, societal changes and new mobility drivers that have the greatest influence on sound environments, and analyzed in detail. From this analysis, insights emerged for urban noise impact and innovative noise mitigation solutions in the light of improved assessment of the links between mobility and urban sound environments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Future of urban sound environments", "Interdisciplinary discussion", "Mobility trends", "Noise mitigation"], "IndexKeywords": ["External costs", "Interdisciplinary teams", "Noise assessments", "Noise mitigation", "Potential impacts", "Societal changes", "Sound environment", "Urban renewal"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087899037", "SubjectAreas": [["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"]], "AuthorData": {"24511904400": {"Name": "Can A.", "AuthorID": "24511904400", "AffiliationID": "60104916, 60114212, 60138422", "AffiliationName": "UMRAE, Univ Gustave Eiffel, IFSTTAR, CEREMA"}, "55330599000": {"Name": "Aumond P.", "AuthorID": "55330599000", "AffiliationID": "60104916, 60114212, 60138422", "AffiliationName": "UMRAE, Univ Gustave Eiffel, IFSTTAR, CEREMA"}, "57221348123": {"Name": "L'Hostis A.", "AuthorID": "57221348123", "AffiliationID": "60104916, 60105092, 60138422, 60026651", "AffiliationName": "LVMT, Univ Gustave Eiffel, IFSTTAR, ENPC"}, "6701666696": {"Name": "Botteldooren D.", "AuthorID": "6701666696", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Ghent University, Department of Information Technology, WAVES Research Group"}, "8603083500": {"Name": "Coelho M.C.", "AuthorID": "8603083500", "AffiliationID": "60194551, 60024825", "AffiliationName": "University of Aveiro, Department of Mechanical Engineering/ Centre for Mechanical Technology and Automation (TEMA)"}, "16174764400": {"Name": "Guarnaccia C.", "AuthorID": "16174764400", "AffiliationID": "60007061", "AffiliationName": "Civil Engineering Department, University of Salerno,Via Giovanni Paolo II"}, "55485135500": {"Name": "Kang J.", "AuthorID": "55485135500", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering, The Bartlett, University College London"}}}
