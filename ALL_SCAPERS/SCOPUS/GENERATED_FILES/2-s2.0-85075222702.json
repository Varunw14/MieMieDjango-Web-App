Methods Standardized data on 12,776 participants, comprising demographics, multiple sclerosis disease characteristics, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, performance measures, and Short Form-36 Physical Component Summary (SF-36 PCS), were pooled from control and treatment arms of 14 clinical trials. Analyses of Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW), 9-Hole Peg Test (9HPT), Low Contrast Letter Acuity (LCLA), and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) included measurement properties; construct, convergent, and known group validity; and longitudinal performance of the measures individually and when combined into a multidimensional test battery relative to the EDSS and SF-36 to determine sensitivity and clinical meaningfulness. Results The performance measures had excellent test-retest reliability and showed expected differences between subgroups based on disease duration and EDSS level. Progression rates in detecting time to 3-month confirmed worsening were lower for T25FW and 9HPT compared to EDSS, while progression rates for LCLA and SDMT were similar to EDSS. When the 4 measures were analyzed as a multidimensional measure rather than as individual measures, progression on any one performance measure was more sensitive than the EDSS. Worsening on the performance measures analyzed individually or as a multidimensional test battery was associated with clinically meaningful SF-36 PCS score worsening, supporting clinical meaningfulness of designated performance test score worsening. Conclusion These results support the use of the 4 proposed performance measures, individually or combined into a multidimensional test battery as study outcome measures.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Databases, Factual", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Meta-Analysis as Topic", "Middle Aged", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Outcome Assessment, Health Care", "Reproducibility of Results", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075222702", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57210530795": {"Name": "Goldman M.D.", "AuthorID": "57210530795", "AffiliationID": "60021918", "AffiliationName": "University of Virginia"}, "57195924393": {"Name": "Larocca N.G.", "AuthorID": "57195924393", "AffiliationID": "60012422", "AffiliationName": "National Multiple Sclerosis Society"}, "7005748344": {"Name": "Rudick R.A.", "AuthorID": "7005748344", "AffiliationID": "60029337", "AffiliationName": "Biogen"}, "35620949000": {"Name": "Phillips G.", "AuthorID": "35620949000", "AffiliationID": "60029337", "AffiliationName": "Biogen"}, "57209515196": {"Name": "Hudson L.D.", "AuthorID": "57209515196", "AffiliationID": "101732084", "AffiliationName": "Critical Path Institute"}, "7004662106": {"Name": "Chin P.S.", "AuthorID": "7004662106", "AffiliationID": "60026209", "AffiliationName": "Genentech"}, "7201978220": {"Name": "Francis G.S.", "AuthorID": "7201978220", "AffiliationID": "123884835", "AffiliationName": "Independent Neurology Clinical Development Consultant"}, "57205485493": {"Name": "Jacobs A.", "AuthorID": "57205485493", "AffiliationID": "60088237", "AffiliationName": "Premier Research"}, "10243885600": {"Name": "Kapoor R.", "AuthorID": "10243885600", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7202324607": {"Name": "Matthews P.M.", "AuthorID": "7202324607", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London, UK Dementia Research Institute"}, "16177709800": {"Name": "Mowry E.M.", "AuthorID": "16177709800", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Johns Hopkins"}, "7004524080": {"Name": "Balcer L.J.", "AuthorID": "7004524080", "AffiliationID": "60024541", "AffiliationName": "New York University School of Medicine"}, "8242704200": {"Name": "Panzara M.", "AuthorID": "8242704200", "AffiliationID": "117369484", "AffiliationName": "Wave Life Sciences"}, "7006076844": {"Name": "Uitdehaag B.M.J.", "AuthorID": "7006076844", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "VU University Medical Center"}, "35428277500": {"Name": "Cohen J.A.", "AuthorID": "35428277500", "AffiliationID": "60021160", "AffiliationName": "Cleveland Clinic"}}}
