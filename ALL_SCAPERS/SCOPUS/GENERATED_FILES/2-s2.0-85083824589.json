Still, whether these GBOs reflect stimulus encoding in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) or nocifensive behavior in the primary motor cortex (M1) is debated. Here we recorded neural activity simultaneously from the brain surface as well as at different depths of the bilateral S1/M1 in freely-moving male rats receiving nociceptive stimulation. GBOs measured from superficial layers of S1 contralateral to the stimulated paw not only had the largest magnitude, but also showed the strongest temporal and phase coupling with epidural GBOs. Also, spiking of superficial S1 interneurons had the strongest phase coherence with epidural GBOs. These results provide the first direct demonstration that scalp GBOs, one of the most promising pain biomarkers, reflect neural activity strongly coupled with the fast spiking of interneurons in the superficial layers of the S1 contralateral to the stimulated side.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomarkers", "Gamma-band oscillations", "Interneurons", "Pain", "Primary motor cortex", "Primary somatosensory cortex"], "IndexKeywords": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Evoked Potentials, Somatosensory", "Gamma Rhythm", "Interneurons", "Male", "Motor Cortex", "Nociception", "Pain", "Pain Perception", "Rats", "Somatosensory Cortex"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083824589", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"57027060100": {"Name": "Yue L.", "AuthorID": "57027060100", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "7401557322": {"Name": "Hu L.", "AuthorID": "7401557322", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "55226971800": {"Name": "Iannetti G.D.", "AuthorID": "55226971800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}}}
