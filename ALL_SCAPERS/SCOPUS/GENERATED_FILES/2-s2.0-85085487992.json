Globalization has resulted in the geographic separation between the source of water inputs for energy production and the sink of its final consumption, making it crucial to factor global supply chain effect into water-energy nexus management. Therefore, this paper investigates water use for energy from source of exploitation to sink of final consumption along global supply chains based on embodiment accounting method. In total, the energy-related water use embodied in international trade is in magnitude about 80% of global total energy-related water use in 2011. It should be noted that non-energy commodities contribute more than four fifths of energy-related water use embodied in international trade and global final consumption. China serves the largest exporter of energy-related water use while EU28 is the biggest receiver. From a perspective of global supply chains, two thirds of USA direct energy-related water use sinks into final consumption from rest of the world, and over a quarter of that embodied in Mainland China's final consumption is from USA, showing the tight relation between them on global supply chains. Findings highlight the urgent need to consider international trade (i.e., energy and non-energy commodity trade) and global supply chain effects for water-energy nexus policy-making to ensure the sustainable water supply for energy development.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Embodiment accounting", "Energy-water nexus", "Global supply chains", "Globalization", "International trade", "Virtual water"], "IndexKeywords": ["Accounting methods", "Energy demands", "Energy development", "Energy productions", "Global supply chain", "Mainland chinas", "Source of waters", "Sustainable water supply"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085487992", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Waste Management and Disposal", "ENVI", "2311"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"]], "AuthorData": {"57211494718": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "57211494718", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Systems Ecology and Sustainability Science, College of Engineering, Peking University"}, "57216465558": {"Name": "Chen B.", "AuthorID": "57216465558", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Systems Ecology and Sustainability Science, College of Engineering, Peking University"}, "7406541589": {"Name": "Chen G.", "AuthorID": "7406541589", "AffiliationID": "60004582", "AffiliationName": "Center of Research Excellence in Renewable Energy and Power Systems, Faculty of Engineering, King Abdulaziz University"}, "57191699695": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "57191699695", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Systems Ecology and Sustainability Science, College of Engineering, Peking University"}, "55975044300": {"Name": "Meng J.", "AuthorID": "55975044300", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Politics and International Studies, University of Cambridge"}, "57216374311": {"Name": "Tasawar H.", "AuthorID": "57216374311", "AffiliationID": "60004582", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Science, King Abdulaziz University"}}}
