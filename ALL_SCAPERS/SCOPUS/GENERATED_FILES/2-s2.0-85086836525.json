Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, electronic medical records for all patients undergoing intravitreal injections in a tertiary referral centre between March 2013 and October 2018 were analysed. Treatment response in terms of VA outcomes was reported for all eyes over a 4-year observation period. Results: Our cohort includes 2614 DMO eyes of 1964 patients over 48 months. Cox proportional-hazards modelling identified injection number (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.18), male gender (HR = 1.13) and baseline VA (HR = 1.09) as independent predictors to reach a favourable visual outcome of more than 70 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters. Half of our cohort reached 70 letters 1.9 months after starting anti-VEGF therapy. Of those that reached 70 letters, 50% fell below 70 letters by 14.7 months. Conclusion: To date, this is the largest single centre cohort study and over the longest observation period reporting on real-life outcomes of anti-VEGF in DMO. We have made an anonymised version of our data set available on an open-source data repository as a resource for clinical researchers globally.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086836525", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"]], "AuthorData": {"57189385073": {"Name": "Kern C.", "AuthorID": "57189385073", "AffiliationID": "60000291", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital LMU"}, "57209181179": {"Name": "Fu D.J.", "AuthorID": "57209181179", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "57210111140": {"Name": "Huemer J.", "AuthorID": "57210111140", "AffiliationID": "60008824", "AffiliationName": "Eye Department, Hanusch Hospital"}, "56600218500": {"Name": "Faes L.", "AuthorID": "56600218500", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "57209035230": {"Name": "Wagner S.K.", "AuthorID": "57209035230", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "6507723181": {"Name": "Kortuem K.", "AuthorID": "6507723181", "AffiliationID": "60000291", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital LMU"}, "7401717575": {"Name": "Patel P.J.", "AuthorID": "7401717575", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health and Research (NIHR) Biomedical Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "8417872600": {"Name": "Rajendram R.", "AuthorID": "8417872600", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "35221042600": {"Name": "Balaskas K.", "AuthorID": "35221042600", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health and Research (NIHR) Biomedical Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "35795310300": {"Name": "Hamilton R.", "AuthorID": "35795310300", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "22958698000": {"Name": "Sim D.A.", "AuthorID": "22958698000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College of London (UCL)"}, "24480921100": {"Name": "Keane P.A.", "AuthorID": "24480921100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College of London (UCL)"}}}
