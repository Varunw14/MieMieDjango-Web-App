All rights reserved.Conjugation by bis-alkylation using latently cross-conjugated reagents is a basis for site-specific PEGylation to the two cysteine thiols derived from a native disulfide. Known as disulfide bridging PEGylation, bis-alkylation can also be used to target histidine imidazole residues allowing for His-tag-selective PEGylation at either the N- or C-terminus of a protein. Incorporation of two histidines in a protein can also be accomplished to facilitate site-selective PEGylation by bis-alkylation at an optimal site within a protein. Other applications beyond PEGylation that can exploit the site-selectivity of bis-alkylation as a basis for conjugation include the development of antibody-drug conjugates, antibody-based mimetics, and multifunctional proteins.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bis-alkylation", "Disulfide bridging conjugation", "Histidine-selective conjugation", "Site-specific PEGylation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85093481838", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"57211279904": {"Name": "Picken C.", "AuthorID": "57211279904", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "56698061000": {"Name": "Awwad S.", "AuthorID": "56698061000", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields, Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "6603596752": {"Name": "Zloh M.", "AuthorID": "6603596752", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "55497503400": {"Name": "Khalili H.", "AuthorID": "55497503400", "AffiliationID": "60026116", "AffiliationName": "University of East London School of Health, Sport and Bioscience"}, "6701323615": {"Name": "Brocchini S.", "AuthorID": "6701323615", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields, Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
