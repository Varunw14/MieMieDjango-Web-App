'Big questions' exercises fulfill this need but simultaneously introduce new challenges in their subjectivity and potential bias. By applying Q methodology to an exercise in developing an international collaborative research agenda for legislative science advice (LSA), we demonstrate a technique to illustrate stakeholder perspectives. While the LSA international respondents - academics, practitioners, and policymakers - demonstrated no difference in their research priorities across advisory system roles, the analysis by developing and developed nation status revealed both common interests in institutional- and systems-level research and distinct preferences. Stakeholders in developing nations prioritized the design of advisory systems, especially in low- and middle-income countries, while those in developed countries emphasized policymaker evidence use. These differences illustrate unique regional research needs that should be met through an international agenda for LSA.", "AuthorKeywords": ["big questions", "legislative science advice", "Q methodology", "research agenda", "transdisciplinary"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85100279523", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Public Administration", "SOCI", "3321"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"36083892500": {"Name": "Akerlof K.", "AuthorID": "36083892500", "AffiliationID": "60018319", "AffiliationName": "Department of Environmental Science and Policy, George Mason University"}, "57211228180": {"Name": "Allegra A.", "AuthorID": "57211228180", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Science and Technology Studies, University College London"}, "6701503947": {"Name": "Webler T.", "AuthorID": "6701503947", "AffiliationID": "60021041", "AffiliationName": "Department of Environmental Studies, Keene State College"}, "57211227355": {"Name": "Heath E.", "AuthorID": "57211227355", "AffiliationID": "60018845", "AffiliationName": "American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)"}, "56976429700": {"Name": "Cloyd E.T.", "AuthorID": "56976429700", "AffiliationID": "60018845", "AffiliationName": "American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)"}, "48462198800": {"Name": "Washbourne C.L.", "AuthorID": "48462198800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Science Technology, Engineering and Public Policy (STEaPP), University College London"}, "57203797860": {"Name": "Tyler C.", "AuthorID": "57203797860", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Science Technology, Engineering and Public Policy (STEaPP), University College London"}}}
