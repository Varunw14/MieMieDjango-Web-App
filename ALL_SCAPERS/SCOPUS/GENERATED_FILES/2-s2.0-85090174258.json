In 261 young people with perinatally acquired HIV in England, 70 (27%) reported 3-day nonadherence, 82 (31%) last month nonadherence, and 106 (41%) nonadherence on either measure. Of those reporting nonadherence on both measures, 52% (23/44) had viral load of <50 copies/ml, compared with 88% (127/145) of those reported being fully adherent. In multivariable analysis, young person and medication theme factors were associated with nonadherence. The main predictors of 3-day nonadherence were antiretroviral therapy containing a boosted protease inhibitor and poorer quality of life. Predictors of last month nonadherence were having told more people about one's HIV status, worse self-perception about having HIV, and boosted protease inhibitor-based regimens. The consistency of individual young person and medication factors in predicting nonadherence gives insight into where interventions may best be targeted to improve adherence.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090174258", "SubjectAreas": [["Advanced and Specialized Nursing", "NURS", "2902"]], "AuthorData": {"19434501100": {"Name": "Judd A.", "AuthorID": "19434501100", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "35512063300": {"Name": "Melvin D.", "AuthorID": "35512063300", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57214258040": {"Name": "Thompson L.C.", "AuthorID": "57214258040", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "55432677400": {"Name": "Foster C.", "AuthorID": "55432677400", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "8669153300": {"Name": "Le Prevost M.", "AuthorID": "8669153300", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "16318592600": {"Name": "Evangeli M.", "AuthorID": "16318592600", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "11638976900": {"Name": "Winston A.", "AuthorID": "11638976900", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "6506318874": {"Name": "Arenas-Pinto A.", "AuthorID": "6506318874", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57126024700": {"Name": "Sturgeon K.", "AuthorID": "57126024700", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "56441342400": {"Name": "Rowson K.", "AuthorID": "56441342400", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "35495600000": {"Name": "Gibb D.M.", "AuthorID": "35495600000", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "35306692400": {"Name": "Castro H.", "AuthorID": "35306692400", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
