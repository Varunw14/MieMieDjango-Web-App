Ensuring transparency of the priority setting process can strengthen legitimacy and credibility for influencing the research agenda. This study aims to develop a reporting guideline for priority setting of health research. Methods: We searched electronic databases and relevant websites for sources (frameworks, guidelines, or models for conducting, appraising, reporting or evaluating health research priority setting, and reviews (including systematic reviews)), and primary studies of research priority setting to July 2019. We inductively developed a list of reporting items and piloted the preliminary guideline with a diverse range of 30 priority setting studies from the records retrieved. Results: From 21,556 records, we included 26 sources for the candidate REPRISE framework and 455 primary research studies. The REporting guideline for PRIority SEtting of health research (REPRISE) has 31 reporting items that cover 10 domains: Context and scope, governance and team, framework for priority setting, stakeholders/participants, identification and collection of priorities, prioritization of research topics, output, evaluation and feedback, translation and implementation, and funding and conflict of interest. Each reporting item includes a descriptor and examples. Conclusions: The REPRISE guideline can facilitate comprehensive reporting of studies of research priority setting. Improved transparency in research priority setting may strengthen the acceptability and implementation of the research priorities identified, so that efforts and funding are invested in generating evidence that is of importance to all stakeholders.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Patient involvement", "Priority-setting", "Reporting", "Transparency"], "IndexKeywords": ["Health Services Research", "Humans", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Research"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077319277", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"23020354400": {"Name": "Tong A.", "AuthorID": "23020354400", "AffiliationID": "60026571", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Kidney Research, Children's Hospital at Westmead"}, "57208582034": {"Name": "Scholes-Robertson N.", "AuthorID": "57208582034", "AffiliationID": "60026571", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Kidney Research, Children's Hospital at Westmead"}, "57197846351": {"Name": "Gutman T.", "AuthorID": "57197846351", "AffiliationID": "60026571", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Kidney Research, Children's Hospital at Westmead"}, "57208129702": {"Name": "Baumgart A.", "AuthorID": "57208129702", "AffiliationID": "60026571", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Kidney Research, Children's Hospital at Westmead"}, "57212677392": {"Name": "Matus A.", "AuthorID": "57212677392", "AffiliationID": "60026571", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Kidney Research, Children's Hospital at Westmead"}, "6508328530": {"Name": "Synnot A.", "AuthorID": "6508328530", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Cochrane Australia, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University"}, "7402766207": {"Name": "Hill S.", "AuthorID": "7402766207", "AffiliationID": "60006925", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Communication and Participation, School of Psychology and Public Health, La Trobe University"}, "36088780600": {"Name": "Crowe S.", "AuthorID": "36088780600", "AffiliationID": "109429635", "AffiliationName": "Crowe Associates Ltd"}, "57220732075": {"Name": "Oliver S.", "AuthorID": "57220732075", "AffiliationID": "60000717", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Humanities, University of Johannesburg"}, "55521195000": {"Name": "Cowan K.", "AuthorID": "55521195000", "AffiliationID": "120821246", "AffiliationName": "Katherine Cowan Consulting Ltd"}, "34571813700": {"Name": "Nasser M.", "AuthorID": "34571813700", "AffiliationID": "60115301, 60024779", "AffiliationName": "Peninsula Dental School, University of Plymouth"}, "55643126300": {"Name": "Bhaumik S.", "AuthorID": "55643126300", "AffiliationID": "60104730", "AffiliationName": "George Institute for Global Health"}, "7401926037": {"Name": "Craig J.C.", "AuthorID": "7401926037", "AffiliationID": "60020828", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine and Public Health, Flinders University"}}}
