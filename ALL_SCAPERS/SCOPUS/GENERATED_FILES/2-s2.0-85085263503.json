Herein, ultrathin NiO films of different thicknesses (8-21 nm) have been deposited via chemical vapor deposition to fabricate gas sensor devices. Sensor performance for a range of NO2 concentrations (800 part-per-billion to 7 part-per-million) was evaluated and an optimum operating temperature of 125 \u00b0C determined. The dependence of the potential relative changes with respect to the NO2 concentration and of the sensor signal with respect to the geometrical parameters was qualitatively evaluated to derive a transduction model capable of fitting the experimental results. The selective sensitivity toward NO2 was confirmed by the limited response for different reducing gases, CO, CH4, NH3, and SO2, under optimum operating conditions, and the sensor signal toward NO2 increased with decreasing thickness, demonstrating that the concept of a Debye length dependence of sensitivity is applicable for the p-type semiconductor NiO. In addition, these NiO sensors were exposed to different relative levels of humidity over a wide range of operating temperatures and were found to display humidity tolerance far superior to those in previous reports on SnO2 materials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["humidity", "low temperature", "Nickel oxide", "NO2 sensing", "thickness dependence"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adsorbate concentration", "Gas sensing films", "Gas sensor devices", "Operating temperature", "Optimum operating conditions", "P type semiconductor", "Sensor performance", "Sensor signals"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085263503", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Process Chemistry and Technology", "CENG", "1508"], ["Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes", "CENG", "1507"]], "AuthorData": {"57194147541": {"Name": "Wilson R.L.", "AuthorID": "57194147541", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Christopher Ingold Laboratories, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003437916": {"Name": "Carmalt C.J.", "AuthorID": "7003437916", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Christopher Ingold Laboratories, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7005826606": {"Name": "Blackman C.S.", "AuthorID": "7005826606", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Christopher Ingold Laboratories, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56248710700": {"Name": "Simion C.E.", "AuthorID": "56248710700", "AffiliationID": "60078585", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Materials Physics"}, "55363600600": {"Name": "Stanoiu A.", "AuthorID": "55363600600", "AffiliationID": "60078585", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Materials Physics"}, "57201695936": {"Name": "Taylor A.", "AuthorID": "57201695936", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "25927105300": {"Name": "Guldin S.", "AuthorID": "25927105300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005284700": {"Name": "Covington J.A.", "AuthorID": "7005284700", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Warwick"}}}
