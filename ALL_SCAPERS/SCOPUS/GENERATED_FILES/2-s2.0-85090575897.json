Herein we report the design and synthesis of analogues of CoA as inhibitors of Aurora A kinase. We have designed and synthesised modified CoA structures as potential inhibitors, combining dicarbonyl mimics of the pyrophosphate group with a conserved adenosine headgroup and different length pantetheine-based tail groups. An analogue with a -SH group at the end of the pantotheinate tail showed the best IC50, probably due to the formation of a covalent bond with Aurora A kinase Cys290.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aurora A kinase", "CoA", "Inhibitor", "Pantetheine", "Pyrophosphate isostere"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090575897", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"57190792700": {"Name": "Bellany F.", "AuthorID": "57190792700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, UCL"}, "55693585500": {"Name": "Tran T.M.", "AuthorID": "55693585500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, UCL"}, "57211564453": {"Name": "Allan H.", "AuthorID": "57211564453", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, UCL"}, "7005824166": {"Name": "Tabor A.B.", "AuthorID": "7005824166", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, UCL"}, "55622378600": {"Name": "Tsuchiya Y.", "AuthorID": "55622378600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, UCL"}, "7006969346": {"Name": "Gout I.", "AuthorID": "7006969346", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, UCL"}, "57211025494": {"Name": "Chan A.W.E.", "AuthorID": "57211025494", "AffiliationID": "60089914, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, University College London"}}}
