Bayesian distances of these stars are available from the catalogue of Sch\u00f6nrich, McMillan & Eyer. We exploit this to map out the behaviour of the velocity ellipsoid within 5 kpc of the Sun. We find that the tilt of the disc-dominated RVS sample is accurately described by the relation \u03b1 = (0.952 \u00b1 0.007) arctan(|z|/R), where (R, z) are cylindrical polar coordinates. This corresponds to velocity ellipsoids close to spherical alignment (for which the normalizing constant would be unity) and pointing towards the Galactic Centre. Flattening of the tilt of the velocity ellipsoids is enhanced close to the plane and Galactic Centre, whilst at high elevations far from the Galactic Centre the population is consistent with exact spherical alignment. Using the LAMOST catalogue cross-matched with Gaia DR2, we construct thin disc and halo samples of reasonable purity based on metallicity. We find that the tilt of thin disc stars straddles \u03b1 = (0.909-1.038) arctan(|z|/R), and of halo stars straddles \u03b1 = (0.927-1.063) arctan(|z|/R). We caution against the use of reciprocal parallax for distances in studies of the tilt, as this can lead to serious artefacts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Galaxy: kinematics and dynamics", "Galaxy: stellar content"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079438643", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57216331282": {"Name": "Everall A.", "AuthorID": "57216331282", "AffiliationID": "60019598, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge"}, "55566835100": {"Name": "Evans N.W.", "AuthorID": "55566835100", "AffiliationID": "60019598, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge"}, "9533050200": {"Name": "Belokurov V.", "AuthorID": "9533050200", "AffiliationID": "60019598, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge"}, "26642272800": {"Name": "Sch\u00f6nrich R.", "AuthorID": "26642272800", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford, Rudolf Peierls Centre for Theoretical Physics, Clarendon Laboratories"}}}
