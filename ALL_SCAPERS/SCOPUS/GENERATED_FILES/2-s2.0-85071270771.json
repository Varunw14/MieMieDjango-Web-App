Unfortunately, these latter teams are still responsible for the security of the systems they build: systems that are ever more important to ever more people. We propose that a series of lightweight in-Terventions, six hours of facilitated workshops delivered over three months, can improve a team's motivation to consider security and awareness of assurance techniques, changing its security culture even when no security experts are involved. The interventions were developed after an Appreciative Inquiry and Grounded Theory survey of security professionals to find out what approaches work best. They were then validated in fieldwork with a Participatory Action Research study that de-livered the workshops to three development organizations. This approach has the potential to be applied by many development teams, improving the security of software worldwide.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Action Research", "Developer Centered Security", "Intervention", "Software Developer", "Software Security"], "IndexKeywords": ["Action research", "Developer Centered Security", "Intervention", "Software developer", "Software security"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071270771", "SubjectAreas": [["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"55534024800": {"Name": "Weir C.", "AuthorID": "55534024800", "AffiliationID": "60118010, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "Security Lancaster, Lancaster University"}, "57194332865": {"Name": "Becker I.", "AuthorID": "57194332865", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Security and Crime Science, University College London"}, "7202238195": {"Name": "Noble J.", "AuthorID": "7202238195", "AffiliationID": "60002316", "AffiliationName": "Engineering and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington"}, "7006802519": {"Name": "Blair L.", "AuthorID": "7006802519", "AffiliationID": "60117772, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "Computing and Communications, Lancaster University"}, "7003530277": {"Name": "Sasse A.", "AuthorID": "7003530277", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science, University College London"}, "7102299639": {"Name": "Rashid A.", "AuthorID": "7102299639", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Cyber Security Group, Bristol University"}}}
