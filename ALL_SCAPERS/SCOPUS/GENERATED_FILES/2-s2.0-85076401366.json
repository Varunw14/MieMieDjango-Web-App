Despite its inability to cleave triple-helical collagens, MMP-3 can still bind to them, but the mechanism, location and role of binding are not known. We used the Collagen Toolkits, libraries of triple-helical peptides that embrace the entire helical domains of collagens II and III, to map MMP-3 interaction sites. The enzyme recognises five sites on collagen II and three sites on collagen III. They share a glycine-phenylalanine-hydroxyproline/alanine (GFO/A) motif that is recognised by the enzyme in a context-dependent manner. Neither MMP-3 zymogen (proMMP-3) nor the individual catalytic (Cat) and hemopexin (Hpx) domains of MMP-3 interact with the peptides, revealing cooperative binding of both domains to the triple helix. The Toolkit binding data combined with molecular modelling enabled us to deduce the putative collagen-binding mode of MMP-3, where all three collagen chains make contacts with the enzyme in the valley running across both Cat and Hpx domains. The observed binding pattern casts light on how MMP-3 could regulate collagen turnover and compete with various collagen-binding proteins regulating cell adhesion and proliferation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Collagen", "Humans", "Matrix Metalloproteinase 1", "Matrix Metalloproteinase 3", "Models, Molecular", "Protein Binding", "Protein Folding"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076401366", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57219834545": {"Name": "Manka S.W.", "AuthorID": "57219834545", "AffiliationID": "60033212, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Prion Unit at UCL, Institute of Prion Diseases"}, "6603187657": {"Name": "Bihan D.", "AuthorID": "6603187657", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "7005465761": {"Name": "Farndale R.W.", "AuthorID": "7005465761", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge"}}}
