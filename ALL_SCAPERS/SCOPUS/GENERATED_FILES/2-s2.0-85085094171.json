Published by Cambridge University Press.BackgroundAcute cannabis administration can produce transient psychotic-like effects in healthy individuals. However, the mechanisms through which this occurs and which factors predict vulnerability remain unclear. We investigate whether cannabis inhalation leads to psychotic-like symptoms and speech illusion; and whether cannabidiol (CBD) blunts such effects (study 1) and adolescence heightens such effects (study 2).MethodsTwo double-blind placebo-controlled studies, assessing speech illusion in a white noise task, and psychotic-like symptoms on the Psychotomimetic States Inventory (PSI). Study 1 compared effects of Cann-CBD (cannabis containing \u0394-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and negligible levels of CBD) with Cann+CBD (cannabis containing THC and CBD) in 17 adults. Study 2 compared effects of Cann-CBD in 20 adolescents and 20 adults. All participants were healthy individuals who currently used cannabis.ResultsIn study 1, relative to placebo, both Cann-CBD and Cann+CBD increased PSI scores but not speech illusion. No differences between Cann-CBD and Cann+CBD emerged. In study 2, relative to placebo, Cann-CBD increased PSI scores and incidence of speech illusion, with the odds of experiencing speech illusion 3.1 (95% CIs 1.3-7.2) times higher after Cann-CBD. No age group differences were found for speech illusion, but adults showed heightened effects on the PSI.ConclusionsInhalation of cannabis reliably increases psychotic-like symptoms in healthy cannabis users and may increase the incidence of speech illusion. CBD did not influence psychotic-like effects of cannabis. Adolescents may be less vulnerable to acute psychotic-like effects of cannabis than adults.", "AuthorKeywords": ["acute effects", "adolescence", "cannabidiol", "cannabis", "CBD", "psychosis", "psychotic-like", "speech illusion", "vulnerability"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085094171", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55643477300": {"Name": "Mokrysz C.", "AuthorID": "55643477300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychopharmacology Unit, University College London"}, "56519869300": {"Name": "Shaban N.D.C.", "AuthorID": "56519869300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychopharmacology Unit, University College London"}, "35077456700": {"Name": "Freeman T.P.", "AuthorID": "35077456700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "National Addiction Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "56288079700": {"Name": "Lawn W.", "AuthorID": "56288079700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychopharmacology Unit, University College London"}, "57220491176": {"Name": "Pope R.A.", "AuthorID": "57220491176", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychopharmacology Unit, University College London"}, "56149013800": {"Name": "Hindocha C.", "AuthorID": "56149013800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychopharmacology Unit, University College London"}, "57205327568": {"Name": "Freeman A.", "AuthorID": "57205327568", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychopharmacology Unit, University College London"}, "12781654600": {"Name": "Wall M.B.", "AuthorID": "12781654600", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London"}, "55774659600": {"Name": "Bloomfield M.A.P.", "AuthorID": "55774659600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544, 60010088", "AffiliationName": "NIHR University College, London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, University College Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57204536028": {"Name": "Morgan C.J.A.", "AuthorID": "57204536028", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Psychopharmacology and Addiction Research Centre, University of Exeter"}, "7005313659": {"Name": "Curran H.V.", "AuthorID": "7005313659", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychopharmacology Unit, University College London"}, "7103331624": {"Name": "Nutt D.J.", "AuthorID": "7103331624", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Neuropsychopharmacology Unit, Division of Experimental Medicine, Imperial College London, Burlington Danes Building"}}}
