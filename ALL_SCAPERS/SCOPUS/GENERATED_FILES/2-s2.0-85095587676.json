We discuss whether this hybrid protocol combining a centralised initiation phase with a decentralised execution phase outperforms fully centralised exchanges with regards to efficiency and security. Here, a fully efficient and fully secure protocol is defined as one where traders incur no trading costs or opportunity costs and counterparty risk is absent. We devise a protocol addressing the main downsides in the decentralised exchange process that uses a facilitating distributed ledger, maintains an order book and monitors the order status in real-time to provide accurate exchange rate information and performance scoring of participants. We show how performance ratings can lower opportunity costs and how a rolling benchmark rate of verifiable trades can be used to establish a trustworthy exchange rate between cryptocurrencies. The formal validation of the proposed technical mechanisms is the subject of future work.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atomic Swap", "Cross-Chain Trading", "Cryptocurrencies", "Exchange Rates", "Hashed Time-Locked Contracts (HTLC)", "Order Books", "Order-Driven Markets", "Quality Scoring"], "IndexKeywords": ["Exchange process", "Exchange rates", "Execution phase", "Formal validation", "Hybrid protocols", "Initiation phase", "Opportunity costs", "Performance ratings"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095587676", "SubjectAreas": [["Management Information Systems", "BUSI", "1404"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Decision Sciences (miscellaneous)", "DECI", "1801"], ["Information Systems and Management", "DECI", "1802"]], "AuthorData": {"57219805068": {"Name": "Platt M.", "AuthorID": "57219805068", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Department of Informatics"}, "57219804272": {"Name": "Pierangeli F.", "AuthorID": "57219804272", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Department of Political Economy"}, "35366644500": {"Name": "Livan G.", "AuthorID": "35366644500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Computer Science"}, "35754777700": {"Name": "Righi S.", "AuthorID": "35754777700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Computer Science"}}}
