Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in particular is associated with repetitive mild TBI (mTBI) and is characterized pathologically by aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau into neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). CTE may be suspected when behavior, cognition, and/or memory deteriorate following repetitive mTBI. Exposure to blast overpressure from improvised explosive devices (IEDs) has been implicated as a potential antecedent for CTE amongst Iraq and Afghanistan Warfighters. In this study, we identified biomarker signatures in rats exposed to repetitive low-level blast that develop chronic anxiety-related traits and in human veterans exposed to IED blasts in theater with behavioral, cognitive, and/or memory complaints. Rats exposed to repetitive low-level blasts accumulated abnormal hyperphosphorylated tau in neuronal perikarya and perivascular astroglial processes. Using positron emission tomography (PET) and the [18F]AV1451 (flortaucipir) tau ligand, we found that five of 10 veterans exhibited excessive retention of [18F]AV1451 at the white/gray matter junction in frontal, parietal, and temporal brain regions, a typical localization of CTE tauopathy. We also observed elevated levels of neurofilament light (NfL) chain protein in the plasma of veterans displaying excess [18F]AV1451 retention. These findings suggest an association linking blast injury, tauopathy, and neuronal injury. Further study is required to determine whether clinical, neuroimaging, and/or fluid biomarker signatures can improve the diagnosis of long-term neuropsychiatric sequelae of mTBI.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079807897", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"6603099923": {"Name": "Dickstein D.L.", "AuthorID": "6603099923", "AffiliationID": "60006762", "AffiliationName": "Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine"}, "23970441900": {"Name": "Knutsen A.", "AuthorID": "23970441900", "AffiliationID": "60006762", "AffiliationName": "Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine"}, "7203009692": {"Name": "Pham D.L.", "AuthorID": "7203009692", "AffiliationID": "60006762", "AffiliationName": "Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine"}, "55366129900": {"Name": "Shahim P.P.", "AuthorID": "55366129900", "AffiliationID": "60013780, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NIH Neurological Institute"}, "7004205832": {"Name": "De Gasperi R.", "AuthorID": "7004205832", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}, "57207893137": {"Name": "Gama Sosa M.A.", "AuthorID": "57207893137", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}, "8504120600": {"Name": "Perez-Garcia G.", "AuthorID": "8504120600", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}, "57202868161": {"Name": "Sosa H.", "AuthorID": "57202868161", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}, "55418022700": {"Name": "Perez G.M.", "AuthorID": "55418022700", "AffiliationID": "60014232", "AffiliationName": "Research and Development Service, James J.
