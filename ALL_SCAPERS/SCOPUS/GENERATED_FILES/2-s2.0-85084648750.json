Published on behalf of The Electrochemical Society by IOP Publishing Limited.Rechargeable lithium-based batteries are one of the key enabling technologies driving the shift to renewable energy, and research into novel technologies has intensified to meet growing demands in applications requiring higher energy and power density. The mechanisms behind battery degradation can be investigated across multiple length-scales with X-ray imaging methods; at the nano-scale severe constraints are imposed on sample size in order to obtain adequate signal to noise. Here, we present a novel laser-milling technique to prepare geometrically optimal samples for X-ray nano-tomography. Advantages of this technique include significantly reduced sample preparation time, and a suitable geometry for mosaic acquisition, enabling a larger field of view to be captured at high spatial resolution, thus improving statistics. The geometry of the resulting electrode remains highly suitable for nano-tomography, and yet permits in situ and operando experiments to be carried out on standard electrode coatings, providing new insights into transient phenomena whilst closely mimicking standard electrochemical cells.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Battery degradation", "Electrode coating", "Enabling technologies", "High spatial resolution", "Milling technique", "Renewable energies", "Sample preparation", "Transient phenomenon"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084648750", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Electrochemistry", "CHEM", "1603"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57191663553": {"Name": "Tan C.", "AuthorID": "57191663553", "AffiliationID": "60172680", "AffiliationName": "Faraday Institution, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "57191666829": {"Name": "Daemi S.", "AuthorID": "57191666829", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57044825000": {"Name": "Heenan T.", "AuthorID": "57044825000", "AffiliationID": "60172680", "AffiliationName": "Faraday Institution, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "56901064000": {"Name": "Iacoviello F.", "AuthorID": "56901064000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57194590371": {"Name": "Leach A.S.", "AuthorID": "57194590371", "AffiliationID": "60172680", "AffiliationName": "Faraday Institution, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "57201197910": {"Name": "Rasha L.", "AuthorID": "57201197910", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56110123700": {"Name": "Jervis R.", "AuthorID": "56110123700", "AffiliationID": "60172680", "AffiliationName": "Faraday Institution, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.J.L.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60172680", "AffiliationName": "Faraday Institution, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.R.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60172680", "AffiliationName": "Faraday Institution, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}}}
