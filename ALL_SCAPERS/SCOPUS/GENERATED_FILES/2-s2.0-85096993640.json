Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdIntroduction: Whilst excision biopsy is traditionally preferred, advances in radiological and histological techniques warrant a re-look at core biopsy as a viable primary diagnostic method. Method: Over a 3-year period, all patients who underwent core biopsy to investigate lymphoma at our centre were included. Results: 554 consecutive patients were included (40.1% prior lymphoma and 59.4% new presentations). Three or more cores were taken in 420 (75.8%) cases. Median time from request to biopsy and biopsy to histology report was 2 (0-40) days and 7 (1-24) days, respectively. 510/544 (93.8%) biopsies were diagnostic. There was no difference in whether the biopsy was diagnostic based on indication (new vs. relapsed lymphoma) (P =.445), whether biopsy was PET-directed (P =.507), for T-cell lymphoma (P =.468) or nodal vs. extra-nodal (P =.693). Thirty-eight patients (6.9%) required a second biopsy due to inadequate tissue. In a patient experience survey, only 13.9% reported any complications (1 self-limiting minor bleeding, 4 bruising) whilst 16.7% reported any discomfort beyond 12 hours. Conclusion: Core biopsy performed by experienced radiologists and analysed by expert haemato-pathologists is a reliable, well-tolerated method for diagnosing lymphoma and confirming relapse. Multiple cores can be obtained under local anaesthetic yielding sufficient material in the majority of cases.", "AuthorKeywords": ["lymphoproliferative diseases", "malignant lymphoma"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096993640", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"57217547676": {"Name": "Cohen O.C.", "AuthorID": "57217547676", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56707694300": {"Name": "Brodermann M.H.", "AuthorID": "56707694300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57220114755": {"Name": "Dervin A.", "AuthorID": "57220114755", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57220119941": {"Name": "Raja N.", "AuthorID": "57220119941", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7003959647": {"Name": "Marafioti T.", "AuthorID": "7003959647", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56712502600": {"Name": "Otero S.", "AuthorID": "56712502600", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "15134919600": {"Name": "Beale T.", "AuthorID": "15134919600", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57202132864": {"Name": "Jawad S.", "AuthorID": "57202132864", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57213652034": {"Name": "Ramsay A.", "AuthorID": "57213652034", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "25628213000": {"Name": "Pomplun S.", "AuthorID": "25628213000", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603239253": {"Name": "Ardeshna K.M.", "AuthorID": "6603239253", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6701429801": {"Name": "Proctor I.", "AuthorID": "6701429801", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "40262704000": {"Name": "Townsend W.", "AuthorID": "40262704000", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7103279928": {"Name": "Morley S.", "AuthorID": "7103279928", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
