But there is also a recognition of the problematic nature of innovation in the construction industry. The Retrofit for the Future Programme (RftF) was set up in 2009 to address these challenges. This paper investigates the genesis of innovation in construction through the experiences of seven retrofit project teams selected from the RftF programme. While contemporary social practice theories (SPTs) offer a framework for describing socio-technical phenomena, they are insufficient to provide an account of innovation. The conceptual framing of this exploration is therefore based on embedding the notion of situated creativity posited by the pragmatists into SPTs. Reflective focus group and in-depth individual interview methods were used for data collection. The analysis focused on the problems encountered by the project teams. The key insight is that innovation appears to be situational, emerging in the face of contextual complexity, from a combination of the project teams\u2019 commitment to the goals of the RftF Programme and their willingness to move beyond routine, to confront problems, and re-think and re-negotiate solutions. Implications of this insight for Social Practice Theory and methodology for investigation of retrofit innovation are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Energy efficiency", "Innovation", "Practice theory", "Retrofit", "Situated creativity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076785546", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Nuclear Energy and Engineering", "ENER", "2104"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"]], "AuthorData": {"7202637730": {"Name": "Lowe R.", "AuthorID": "7202637730", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Energy Institute, University College London"}, "56162442500": {"Name": "Chiu L.F.", "AuthorID": "56162442500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Energy Institute, University College London"}}}
