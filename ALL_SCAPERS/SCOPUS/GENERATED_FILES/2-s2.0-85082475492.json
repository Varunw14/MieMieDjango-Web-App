The WHO guidance states that patients with (COVID-19) should be managed by staff wearing appropriate personal protective equipment; however, working whilst wearing personal protective equipment is unfamiliar to many healthcare professionals. We ran high-fidelity, in-situ simulation of high-risk procedures on patients with COVID-19 in a negative-pressure side room on our intensive care unit (ICU). Our aim was to identify potential problems, test the robustness of our systems and inform modification of our standard operating procedures for any patients with COVID-19 admitted to our ICU. The simulations revealed several important latent risks and allowed us to put corrective measures in place before the admission of patients with COVID-19. We recommend that staff working in clinical areas expected to receive patients with COVID-19 conduct in-situ simulation in order to detect their own unique risks and aid in the creation of local guidelines of management of patients with COVID-19.", "AuthorKeywords": ["coronavirus", "COVID-19", "intensive care medicine", "simulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Betacoronavirus", "Coronavirus Infections", "Humans", "Intensive Care Units", "Pandemics", "Patient Admission", "Pneumonia, Viral", "Space Simulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082475492", "SubjectAreas": [["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"54402909700": {"Name": "Fregene T.E.", "AuthorID": "54402909700", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57215972185": {"Name": "Nadarajah P.", "AuthorID": "57215972185", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, Royal Free Hospital"}, "8507763800": {"Name": "Bigham S.", "AuthorID": "8507763800", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Intensive Care, Royal Free Hospital"}, "8557246000": {"Name": "Nangalia V.", "AuthorID": "8557246000", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57212796997": {"Name": "Buckley J.F.", "AuthorID": "57212796997", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Intensive Care, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
