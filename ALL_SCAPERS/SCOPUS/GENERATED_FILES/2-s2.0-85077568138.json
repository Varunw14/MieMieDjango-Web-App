However, the velocity and density of subducted oceanic crust at lower-mantle conditions remain unknown. Here, we report ab initio results for the elastic properties of calcium ferrite\u2010type phases and determine the velocities and density of oceanic crust along different mantle geotherms. We find that the subducted oceanic crust shows a large negative shear velocity anomaly at the phase boundary between stishovite and CaCl2-type silica, which is highly consistent with the feature of mid-mantle scatterers. After this phase transition in silica, subducted oceanic crust will be visible as high-velocity heterogeneities as imaged by seismic tomography. This study suggests that the presence of subducted oceanic crust could provide good explanations for some lower-mantle seismic heterogeneities with different length scales except large low shear velocity provinces (LLSVPs).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077568138", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57189226917": {"Name": "Wang W.", "AuthorID": "57189226917", "AffiliationID": "60019118", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Seismology and Physics of Earth\u2019s Interior, School of Earth and Space Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China"}, "57213160464": {"Name": "Xu Y.", "AuthorID": "57213160464", "AffiliationID": "60019118", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Seismology and Physics of Earth\u2019s Interior, School of Earth and Space Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China"}, "15053614500": {"Name": "Sun D.", "AuthorID": "15053614500", "AffiliationID": "60019499", "AffiliationName": "CAS Center for Excellence in Comparative Planetology"}, "55346341400": {"Name": "Wu Z.", "AuthorID": "55346341400", "AffiliationID": "60019499", "AffiliationName": "CAS Center for Excellence in Comparative Planetology"}, "7101821530": {"Name": "Ni S.", "AuthorID": "7101821530", "AffiliationID": "60000126, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Geodesy and Earth\u2019s Dynamics, Institute of Geodesy and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "57206228642": {"Name": "Wentzcovitch R.", "AuthorID": "57206228642", "AffiliationID": "60033011, 60030162", "AffiliationName": "Lamont\u2013Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University"}}}
