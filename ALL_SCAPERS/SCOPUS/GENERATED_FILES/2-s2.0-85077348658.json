Unintentional weight loss is associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality, but few studies have examined its association with cardiovascular outcomes in patients with diabetes. Objective: To evaluate 2-year weight change and subsequent risk of cardiovascular events and mortality in established type 2 diabetes. Design and Setting: The Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron-MR Controlled Evaluation was an international, multisite 2\u00d72 factorial trial of intensive glucose control and blood pressure control. We examined 5 categories of 2-year weight change: >10% loss, 4% to 10% loss, stable (\u00b1<4%), 4% to 10% gain, and >10% gain. We used Cox regression with follow-up time starting at 2 years, adjusting for intervention arm, demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, and diabetes medication use from the 2-year visit. Results: Among 10 081 participants with valid weight measurements, average age was 66 years. By the 2-year examination, 4.3% had >10% weight loss, 18.4% had 4% to 10% weight loss, and 5.3% had >10% weight gain. Over the following 3 years of the trial, >10% weight loss was strongly associated with major macrovascular events (hazard ratio [HR], 1.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-2.44), cardiovascular mortality (HR, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.87-4.09), all-cause mortality (HR, 2.79; 95% CI, 2.10-3.71), but not major microvascular events (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.61-1.36), compared with stable weight. There was no evidence of effect modification by baseline body mass index, age, or type of diabetes medication. Conclusions: In the absence of substantial lifestyle changes, weight loss may be a warning sign of poor health meriting further workup in patients with type 2 diabetes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Body-Weight Trajectory", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Drug Combinations", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Gliclazide", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Indapamide", "Life Style", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Obesity", "Overweight", "Perindopril", "Risk Factors", "Weight Gain", "Weight Loss"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077348658", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Biochemistry (medical)", "MEDI", "2704"]], "AuthorData": {"57191918953": {"Name": "Lee A.K.", "AuthorID": "57191918953", "AffiliationID": "60024002, 60006183", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology, and Clinical Research, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"}, "7102510958": {"Name": "Woodward M.", "AuthorID": "7102510958", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60175824", "AffiliationName": "George Institute for Global Health, University of Oxford"}, "57198515345": {"Name": "Wang D.", "AuthorID": "57198515345", "AffiliationID": "60024002, 60006183", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology, and Clinical Research, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"}, "57192543884": {"Name": "Warren B.", "AuthorID": "57192543884", "AffiliationID": "60024002, 60006183", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology, and Clinical Research, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"}, "57203881299": {"Name": "Richey Sharrett A.", "AuthorID": "57203881299", "AffiliationID": "60024002, 60006183", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology, and Clinical Research, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"}, "6602453920": {"Name": "Selvin E.", "AuthorID": "6602453920", "AffiliationID": "60024002, 60006183", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology, and Clinical Research, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"}, "35435717800": {"Name": "Ohkuma T.", "AuthorID": "35435717800", "AffiliationID": "60104730", "AffiliationName": "George Institute for Global Health"}, "54912078200": {"Name": "Chalmers J.", "AuthorID": "54912078200", "AffiliationID": "60104730", "AffiliationName": "George Institute for Global Health"}, "57198065489": {"Name": "Williams B.", "AuthorID": "57198065489", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Health Research, UCL Hospitals Biomedical Research Center"}, "57190092171": {"Name": "Marre M.", "AuthorID": "57190092171", "AffiliationID": "60026040", "AffiliationName": "INSERM U 1138"}, "35370402400": {"Name": "Hamet P.", "AuthorID": "35370402400", "AffiliationID": "60009657", "AffiliationName": "Center de Rechercher, Center Hospitalier de l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al (CRCHUM)"}, "7005401249": {"Name": "Harrap S.", "AuthorID": "7005401249", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60005245", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Royal Melbourne Hospital, University of Melbourne"}, "35362533700": {"Name": "McEvoy J.W.", "AuthorID": "35362533700", "AffiliationID": "60008539", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, National University of Ireland, Galway Campus, National Institute for Preventive Cardiology"}}}
