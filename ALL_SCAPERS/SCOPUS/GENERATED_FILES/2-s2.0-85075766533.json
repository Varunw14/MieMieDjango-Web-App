Since many tumours are not visible in ultrasound, registration to a pre-operative CT has been proposed as a guidance method. In addition to being multi-modal, this registration problem is greatly affected by the differences in field of view between CT and LUS, and thus requires an accurate initialisation. We propose a novel method of registering smaller field of view slices to a larger volume globally using a Content-based retrieval framework. This problem is under-constrained for a single slice registration, resulting in non-unique solutions. Therefore, we introduce kinematic priors in a Bayesian framework in order to jointly register groups of ultrasound images. Our method then produces an estimate of the most likely sequence of CT images to represent the ultrasound acquisition and does not require tracking information nor an accurate initialisation. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in multiple LUS acquisitions taken from three sets of clinical data.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bayesian models", "Laparoscopic Ultrasound", "Multi-modal Registration"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bayesian frameworks", "Bayesian model", "Laparoscopic ultrasound", "Multimodal registration", "Non-unique solutions", "Registration problems", "Ultrasound images", "Under-constrained"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075766533", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57193900208": {"Name": "Ramalhinho J.", "AuthorID": "57193900208", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "57200968565": {"Name": "Tregidgo H.", "AuthorID": "57200968565", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "35464300200": {"Name": "Hawkes D.", "AuthorID": "35464300200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "7005201740": {"Name": "Barratt D.", "AuthorID": "7005201740", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "7006920406": {"Name": "Clarkson M.", "AuthorID": "7006920406", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "57212020921": {"Name": "Allam M.", "AuthorID": "57212020921", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "57212023081": {"Name": "Travlou N.", "AuthorID": "57212023081", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "16301178800": {"Name": "Gurusamy K.", "AuthorID": "16301178800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "7402965763": {"Name": "Davidson B.", "AuthorID": "7402965763", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}}}
