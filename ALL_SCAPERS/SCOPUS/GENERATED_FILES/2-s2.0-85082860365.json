There is a paucity of studies about the association between transport and objective health measures using nationally representative samples worldwide, especially from Latin American countries. The aim of this research is to explore the relationship between active transportation and objective health measures in Chile. Methods: We analysed the Chilean National Health Survey (ENS) 2016\u20132017, based on a nationally representative sample of non-institutionalised adults aged \u226515 years (n = 6,113). ENS included anthropometric measures (weight, height, waist circumference), a specific question about the main mode of transportation and several metabolic markers. Results: 41%, 38% and 21% of participants used public transport, motor vehicles and active (cycling and walking) transport respectively. Higher levels of active transport were observed in males, younger groups, less educated and rural populations. Both active and public transport were associated with multiple nutritional and metabolic benefits such as lower BMI, lower waist circumference, less obesity, higher vitamin D, lower cholesterol and lower hepatic inflammation. Associations persisted after adjusting for other healthy lifestyles. Stronger benefits were observed in males than in females. Conclusions: Promoting active transportation in urban planning policies may help Chile tackle the growing burden of chronic diseases.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Active transport", "Anthropometry", "Biomarkers", "National Health survey", "Public transport", "Transport mode"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082860365", "SubjectAreas": [["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"], ["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"], ["Safety Research", "SOCI", "3311"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57216222632": {"Name": "Passi-Solar \u00c1.", "AuthorID": "57216222632", "AffiliationID": "60029681", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, School of Medicine, Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile"}, "7005836049": {"Name": "Mindell J.S.", "AuthorID": "7005836049", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "16242235100": {"Name": "Margozzini P.", "AuthorID": "16242235100", "AffiliationID": "60029681", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, School of Medicine, Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile"}, "57192157074": {"Name": "Cortinez-O'Ryan A.", "AuthorID": "57192157074", "AffiliationID": "60012035", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physical Education, Sports and Recreation, Universidad de La Frontera"}, "35368813300": {"Name": "Mu\u00f1oz J.C.", "AuthorID": "35368813300", "AffiliationID": "60029681", "AffiliationName": "Department of Transport Engineering and Logistics, Centre for Sustainable Urban Development (CEDEUS), Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile"}}}
