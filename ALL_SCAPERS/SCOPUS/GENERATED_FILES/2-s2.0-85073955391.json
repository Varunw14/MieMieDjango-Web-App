These symptoms can affect how the person with dementia understands and performs in social interactions. This qualitative review investigated how people with mild to moderate dementia managed social connections. A systematic search of social science databases retrieved 13 articles; data were synthesized using thematic analysis. Results established the work undertaken by people with dementia to maintain and present a social persona seen as socially acceptable. Interpretations are contextualized within Goffman and Sabat\u2019s theories on \u201cself.\u201d People with dementia were agentic in impression management: undertaking work to maintain recognized social roles, while being aware of when their illness led to others discrediting them. Wider recognition of strategies used to maintain a social self could inform interventions designed to increase capability and confidence in co-managing social connections following dementia diagnosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["agency", "Canada", "dementia", "Europe", "Goffman", "literature review", "North America", "qualitative", "Sabat", "self", "social construction", "sociology", "stigma"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dementia", "Humans", "Interpersonal Relations", "Qualitative Research", "Self Concept", "Social Behavior", "Social Environment", "Social Support"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073955391", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"55778792500": {"Name": "Birt L.", "AuthorID": "55778792500", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "University of East Anglia"}, "6507156058": {"Name": "Poland F.", "AuthorID": "6507156058", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "University of East Anglia"}, "57211438290": {"Name": "Griffiths R.", "AuthorID": "57211438290", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "University of Nottingham"}, "7006161600": {"Name": "Orrell M.", "AuthorID": "7006161600", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "University of Nottingham"}, "6602617245": {"Name": "Charlesworth G.", "AuthorID": "6602617245", "AffiliationID": "60107401", "AffiliationName": "North East London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35726525300": {"Name": "Higgs P.", "AuthorID": "35726525300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56427480200": {"Name": "Leung P.", "AuthorID": "56427480200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
