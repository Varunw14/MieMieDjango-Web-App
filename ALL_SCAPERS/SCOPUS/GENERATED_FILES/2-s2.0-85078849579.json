It is difficult to define what constitutes usual care in smoking cessation services. We aimed to define what this was during the trial. Twenty-two National Health Service healthcare providers participated in a bespoke survey asking about usual care in their area.Results All sites offered smoking cessation support; however, service provider and service type varied substantially. In some cases services were not streamlined, meaning that people received smoking cessation counselling from one organisation and smoking cessation medication from another.Clinical implications To better implement the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline PH48, clearer referral pathways need to be implemented and communicated to patients, staff and carers. People with severe mental ill health need to be able to access services that combine nicotine replacement therapy and behavioural support in a streamlined manner.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bipolar affective disorders", "nicotine replacement therapy", "schizophrenia", "Severe mental ill health", "smoking cessation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078849579", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57193058255": {"Name": "Heron P.", "AuthorID": "57193058255", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health and Addiction Research Group, University of York"}, "56637623200": {"Name": "Bailey D.", "AuthorID": "56637623200", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health and Addiction Research Group, University of York"}, "56580778500": {"Name": "Li J.", "AuthorID": "56580778500", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health and Addiction Research Group, University of York"}, "37015647400": {"Name": "Mishu M.", "AuthorID": "37015647400", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health and Addiction Research Group, University of York"}, "8342965100": {"Name": "Parrott S.", "AuthorID": "8342965100", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health and Addiction Research Group, University of York"}, "6508333108": {"Name": "Peckham E.", "AuthorID": "6508333108", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health and Addiction Research Group, University of York"}, "7003612713": {"Name": "Gilbody S.", "AuthorID": "7003612713", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health and Addiction Research Group, University of York"}, "57210417090": {"Name": "Mccloud T.", "AuthorID": "57210417090", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "57189923687": {"Name": "Osborn D.", "AuthorID": "57189923687", "AffiliationID": "60161451", "AffiliationName": "Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56254711600": {"Name": "Arundel C.", "AuthorID": "56254711600", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "York Trials Unit, University of York"}, "12767413000": {"Name": "Ker S.", "AuthorID": "12767413000", "AffiliationID": "60170461", "AffiliationName": "Huntington House Mental Health Resource Centre, Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57200315298": {"Name": "Stribling A.", "AuthorID": "57200315298", "AffiliationID": "60005210", "AffiliationName": "Windsor Research Unit, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
