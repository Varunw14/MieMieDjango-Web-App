Advanced Energy Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbHSolid-state Li metal batteries (SSLMBs) combine improved safety and high specific energy that can surpass current Li ion batteries. However, the Li+ ion diffusivity in a composite cathode\u2014a combination of active material and solid-state electrolyte (SSE)\u2014is at least an order of magnitude lower than that of the SSE alone because of the highly tortuous ion transport pathways in the cathode. This lowers the realizable capacity and mandates relatively thin (30\u2013300 \u03bcm) cathodes, and hence low overall energy storage. Here, a thick (600 \u03bcm) hybrid cathode comprising vertically aligned LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811)-rich channels filled with a [LiTFSI+PEGMA+MePrPyl TFSI] polymer composite electrolyte is fabricated by an innovative directional freezing and polymerization method. X-ray micro-computed tomography, ion mobility simulations, and DC depolarization show that the cathode structure improves Li+ ion diffusivity in the cathode from 4.4 \u00d7 10\u22129 to 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22127 cm2 s\u22121. In a SSLMB full cell at 25 oC, the cathode provides gravimetric capacities of 199 and 120 mAh g\u22121, and ultra-high areal capacities of 16.7 and 10.1 mAh cm\u22122 at 0.05 and 1 C, respectively. The work demonstrates a scalable approach to realizing composite cathode structures with kinetically favorable ion transport characteristics in SSLMBs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["battery manufacture", "cathodes", "ion transport", "NMC811", "solid-state batteries"], "IndexKeywords": ["Directional freezing", "Gravimetric capacity", "Ion transport pathways", "Polymer composite electrolytes", "Polymerization method", "Solid-state electrolyte", "Vertically aligned", "X ray micro-computed tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85093978622", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"55754158700": {"Name": "Huang C.", "AuthorID": "55754158700", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, University of Oxford"}, "56414057100": {"Name": "Grant P.S.", "AuthorID": "56414057100", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, University of Oxford"}, "57201552479": {"Name": "Leung C.L.A.", "AuthorID": "57201552479", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "55085130600": {"Name": "Leung P.", "AuthorID": "55085130600", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering and the Environment, University of Southampton"}}}
