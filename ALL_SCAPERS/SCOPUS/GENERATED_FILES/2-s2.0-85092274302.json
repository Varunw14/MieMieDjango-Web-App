For many pollutants, where long-term monitoring is absent, paleoecological approaches (the use of naturally-accumulating archives to assess temporal trends) have been widely applied to determine such historical patterns, but to date this has been undertaken only very rarely for microplastics, despite the enormous potential to identify the scale and extent of inputs as well as rates of change. In this paper, we briefly assess the long-term monitoring and paleoecological microplastic literature before considering the advantages and disadvantages of various natural archives (including lake and marine sediments, ice cores and peat archives) as a means to determine historical microplastic records, as well as the range of challenges facing those attempting to extract microplastics from them. We also outline some of the major considerations in chemical, physical and biological taphonomic processes for microplastics as these are critical to the correct interpretation of microplastic paleoecological records but are currently rarely considered. Finally, we assess the usefulness of microplastic paleoecological records as a stratigraphic tool, both as a means to provide potential chronological information, as well as a possible marker for the proposed Anthropocene Epoch.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anthropocene", "anthropogenic particles", "chemostratigraphic units", "ice cores", "peats", "sediment cores", "taphonomy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092274302", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"]], "AuthorData": {"57219338420": {"Name": "Bancone C.E.P.", "AuthorID": "57219338420", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, Environmental Change Research Centre, University College London"}, "7402275188": {"Name": "Turner S.D.", "AuthorID": "7402275188", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, Environmental Change Research Centre, University College London"}, "57203203579": {"Name": "Rose N.L.", "AuthorID": "57203203579", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, Environmental Change Research Centre, University College London"}, "17342425900": {"Name": "Ivar do Sul J.A.", "AuthorID": "17342425900", "AffiliationID": "60072358", "AffiliationName": "Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research"}}}
