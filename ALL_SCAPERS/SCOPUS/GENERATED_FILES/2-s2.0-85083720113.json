By collecting off-axial scattered light, the technique overcomes the large background from in-line light within scattering media. In this paper we present a configuration which enables the highly efficient collection of spectral markers, indicative of bone health, including Raman signatures to assess phosphate, collagen and carbonate content, at millimeter depths. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique by performing spectral decompositions to analyze the molecular distribution of these markers non-invasively, using in vitro model systems, comprising bone and tissue, in situ.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Depth profile", "high efficiency", "spatially offset Raman spectroscopy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carbonate content", "Molecular compositions", "Molecular distribution", "Raman signatures", "Scattering media", "Spatially offset raman spectroscopies", "Spectral decomposition", "Spectral information"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083720113", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"56366927300": {"Name": "Cui H.", "AuthorID": "56366927300", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, James Watt School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "7003822477": {"Name": "Glidle A.", "AuthorID": "7003822477", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, James Watt School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "55154841200": {"Name": "Cooper J.M.", "AuthorID": "55154841200", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, James Watt School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}}}
