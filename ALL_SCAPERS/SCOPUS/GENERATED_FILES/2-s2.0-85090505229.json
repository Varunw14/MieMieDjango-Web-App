Molecular evolutionary analyses can trace viral origins by establishing relatedness and divergence times of viruses and identifying past selective pressures. However, we must uphold rigorous standards of inference and interpretation on this topic because of the ramifications of being wrong. Here, we dispute the conclusions of Xia (2020. Extreme genomic CpG deficiency in SARS-CoV-2 and evasion of host antiviral defense. Mol Biol Evol. doi:10.1093/molbev/masa095) that dogs are a likely intermediate host of a SARS-CoV-2 ancestor.We highlight major flaws in Xia's inference process and his analysis of CpG deficiencies, and conclude that there is no direct evidence for the role of dogs as intermediate hosts. Bats and pangolins currently have the greatest support as ancestral hosts of SARS-CoV-2, with the strong caveat that sampling of wildlife species for coronaviruses has been limited.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bats", "COVID-19", "CpG deficiency", "Dogs", "Pangolin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alphacoronavirus", "Animals", "Betacoronavirus", "Biological Evolution", "Chiroptera", "Coronavirus Infections", "CpG Islands", "Dogs", "Eutheria", "Genome, Viral", "Humans", "Immune Evasion", "Pandemics", "Pneumonia, Viral", "Protein Binding", "Reassortant Viruses", "RNA, Viral", "RNA-Binding Proteins", "Virus Replication"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090505229", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"7202569082": {"Name": "Pollock D.D.", "AuthorID": "7202569082", "AffiliationID": "60001439", "AffiliationName": "Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics, Department of Biology, Pennsylvania State University"}, "57218865849": {"Name": "Wade K.J.", "AuthorID": "57218865849", "AffiliationID": "60001439", "AffiliationName": "Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics, Department of Biology, Pennsylvania State University"}, "6602980445": {"Name": "Castoe T.A.", "AuthorID": "6602980445", "AffiliationID": "60001439", "AffiliationName": "Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics, Department of Biology, Pennsylvania State University"}, "57189594146": {"Name": "Perry B.W.", "AuthorID": "57189594146", "AffiliationID": "60001439", "AffiliationName": "Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics, Department of Biology, Pennsylvania State University"}, "57216539423": {"Name": "Lytras S.", "AuthorID": "57216539423", "AffiliationID": "60001439", "AffiliationName": "Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics, Department of Biology, Pennsylvania State University"}, "7402818741": {"Name": "Robertson D.L.", "AuthorID": "7402818741", "AffiliationID": "60001439", "AffiliationName": "Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics, Department of Biology, Pennsylvania State University"}, "57218539361": {"Name": "Holmes E.C.", "AuthorID": "57218539361", "AffiliationID": "60001439", "AffiliationName": "Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics, Department of Biology, Pennsylvania State University"}, "57219637754": {"Name": "Boni M.F.", "AuthorID": "57219637754", "AffiliationID": "60001439", "AffiliationName": "Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics, Department of Biology, Pennsylvania State University"}, "7801633431": {"Name": "Kosakovsky Pond S.L.", "AuthorID": "7801633431", "AffiliationID": "60030398", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Genomics and Evolutionary Medicine, Temple University"}, "57218866924": {"Name": "Parry R.", "AuthorID": "57218866924", "AffiliationID": "60031004, 60160422", "AffiliationName": "Australian Infectious Disease Research Centre, School of Biological Sciences, University of Queensland"}, "6701665177": {"Name": "Carlton E.J.", "AuthorID": "6701665177", "AffiliationID": "60104705, 60028392", "AffiliationName": "Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, Colorado School of Public Health, University of Colorado, Anschutz"}, "7404353992": {"Name": "Wood J.L.N.", "AuthorID": "7404353992", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Disease Dynamics Unit, Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "8372326400": {"Name": "Pennings P.S.", "AuthorID": "8372326400", "AffiliationID": "60027627", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, San Francisco State University"}, "7403005698": {"Name": "Goldstein R.A.", "AuthorID": "7403005698", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}}}
