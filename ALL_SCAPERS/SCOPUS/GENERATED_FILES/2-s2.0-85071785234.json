Inspired by crystal structure prediction, the search for neat polymorphs was expanded to an unusual range of experiments, including melt crystallization under pressure, to work around solvate formation and the thermal instability of the molecule. Ten polymorphs of galunisertib were found; however, the structure predicted to be the most stable has yet to be obtained. We present the crystal structures of all ten unsolvated polymorphs of galunisertib, showing how state-of-the-art characterization methods can be combined with emerging computational modeling techniques to produce a complete structure landscape and assess the risk of late-appearing, more stable polymorphs. The exceptional conformational polymorphism of this prolific solvate former invites further development of methods, computational and experimental, that are applicable to larger, flexible molecules with complex solid form landscapes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Characterization methods", "Computational model", "Conformational polymorphisms", "Crystal structure prediction", "Flexible molecules", "Melt crystallization", "State of the art", "Thermal instabilities"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071785234", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Colloid and Surface Chemistry", "CENG", "1505"]], "AuthorData": {"55520963700": {"Name": "Bhardwaj R.M.", "AuthorID": "55520963700", "AffiliationID": "60025685", "AffiliationName": "Small Molecule Design and Development, Eli Lilly and Company"}, "8058938600": {"Name": "McMahon J.A.", "AuthorID": "8058938600", "AffiliationID": "60025685", "AffiliationName": "Small Molecule Design and Development, Eli Lilly and Company"}, "56717347100": {"Name": "Nyman J.", "AuthorID": "56717347100", "AffiliationID": "60032179", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University of Wisconsin - Madison"}, "6508068083": {"Name": "Reutzel-Edens S.M.", "AuthorID": "6508068083", "AffiliationID": "60025685", "AffiliationName": "Small Molecule Design and Development, Eli Lilly and Company"}, "7201882352": {"Name": "Price L.S.", "AuthorID": "7201882352", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7202475468": {"Name": "Price S.L.", "AuthorID": "7202475468", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "36859958100": {"Name": "Oswald I.D.H.", "AuthorID": "36859958100", "AffiliationID": "60024724", "AffiliationName": "Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Strathclyde"}, "55129368100": {"Name": "Konar S.", "AuthorID": "55129368100", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Edinburgh"}, "6603751095": {"Name": "Pulham C.R.", "AuthorID": "6603751095", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Edinburgh"}}}
