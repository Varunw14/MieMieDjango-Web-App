Aims: To examine the frequency of biochemically defined and clinically significant episodes of treatment associated haemolysis, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and acute kidney injury(AKI) in a cohort of patients on maintenance Immunoglobulin(Ig) therapy for inflammatory neuropathy. Methods: A retrospective review of routine blood monitoring in patients from two UK specialist peripheral nerve centres. Accepted definitions for clinically and biochemically significant haemolysis, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and AKI were used. Results: 1919 infusion episodes in 90 patients were analysed. Age(mean(S.D)) = 58.09(14.4)years, 63% male, 72% CIDP(28% MMN), 97% IVIg(3% SCIg). Dose = 1.57(0.79)g/kg/month or 97.1(37.3)g/infusion, frequency:3.9(1.4) weeks. Relative IgA deficiency was noted in 2 individuals (prevalence:2.2%, 95%C.I.:0\u20135.2) who received a combined total of 38 infusions(3800 g IVIg) without adverse event. No clinically significant episodes of haemolysis, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia or AKI occurred in relation to treatment. An asymptomatic drop>10 g/L haemoglobin(Hb) occurred in 3.5%(95%CI:2.7\u20134.3) of treatment episodes in 38 individuals, mean reduction:17.7(7.4)g/L; lowest Hb:86 g/L. Lower pre-treatment haemoglobin correlated with risk of recurrent Ig-related drop(p:0.007). Two patients with chronic renal failure(stage 1 and 3) received 28(IV) and 104(SC) infusions respectively(6416 g) without impact on estimated glomerular filtration rate(eGFR). Conclusions: No clinically significant Ig-related episodes of haemolysis or AKI were identified in this representative cohort. This suggests that routine monitoring is not essential in long-term Ig use but should be considered when clinically indicated.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CIDP", "Drug safety", "Inflammatory neuropathy", "Intravenous immunoglobulin", "MMN"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074116049", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57211411766": {"Name": "Keh R.", "AuthorID": "57211411766", "AffiliationID": "60008873", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Centre for Clinical Neuroscience, Salford Royal Hospital"}, "6508010809": {"Name": "Gosal D.", "AuthorID": "6508010809", "AffiliationID": "60008873", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Centre for Clinical Neuroscience, Salford Royal Hospital"}, "57200196849": {"Name": "Lavin T.M.", "AuthorID": "57200196849", "AffiliationID": "60008873", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Centre for Clinical Neuroscience, Salford Royal Hospital"}, "57211472442": {"Name": "Kahlil A.", "AuthorID": "57211472442", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "36459834200": {"Name": "Nihoyannopoulos L.", "AuthorID": "36459834200", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57211474712": {"Name": "Compton L.", "AuthorID": "57211474712", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57201349598": {"Name": "Kapoor M.", "AuthorID": "57201349598", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "16157439300": {"Name": "Manji H.", "AuthorID": "16157439300", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57218107544": {"Name": "Rossor A.M.", "AuthorID": "57218107544", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57203175311": {"Name": "Reilly M.M.", "AuthorID": "57203175311", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "7004224851": {"Name": "Lunn M.P.", "AuthorID": "7004224851", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "36183183600": {"Name": "Carr A.S.", "AuthorID": "36183183600", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
