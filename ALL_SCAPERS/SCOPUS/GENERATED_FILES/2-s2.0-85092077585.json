Objective: To estimate the frequency of ligamentum arteriosum calcification in children at postmortem imaging. Materials and methods: We conducted a single-centre retrospective review of paediatric postmortem CT and chest radiographic imaging over a 6-year period (January 2012 to December 2018). Two independent reviewers assessed the presence of calcification on imaging. We calculated descriptive statistical analysis of ligamentum arteriosum calcification frequency and association with age and gender. Results: During the study period, 220 children underwent whole-body postmortem CT and 182 underwent radiographic imaging. The frequency was higher on postmortem CT than plain radiographs (67/220, 30.5% vs. 3/182, 1.6%) and was highest in children ages 1\u20137 years (53.6\u201366.7%), with gradual reduction in frequency in older children, and none in children older than 12 years. There was no gender predilection. Conclusion: In the postmortem setting, ligamentum arteriosum calcification is a common finding in children <8 years of age. It can be better identified on postmortem CT than chest radiographs. Radiologists new to reporting postmortem paediatric CT studies should recognise this as a common normal finding to avoid unnecessary further investigations at autopsy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Calcification", "Children", "Computed tomography", "Frequency", "Imaging", "Ligamentum arteriosum", "Postmortem"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092077585", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57194585987": {"Name": "Davendralingam N.", "AuthorID": "57194585987", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Radiology, St. Bartholomew\u2019s Hospital"}, "55552924700": {"Name": "Agahi A.", "AuthorID": "55552924700", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Radiology, St. Bartholomew\u2019s Hospital"}, "55545709400": {"Name": "Shelmerdine S.C.", "AuthorID": "55545709400", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital NIHR Biomedical Research Centre"}, "6507902996": {"Name": "Arthurs O.J.", "AuthorID": "6507902996", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital NIHR Biomedical Research Centre"}, "57006097800": {"Name": "Hutchinson J.C.", "AuthorID": "57006097800", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "57191492349": {"Name": "Barrett H.", "AuthorID": "57191492349", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "57193324861": {"Name": "Palm L.", "AuthorID": "57193324861", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "57193849988": {"Name": "Chopra M.", "AuthorID": "57193849988", "AffiliationID": "60015756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Radiology, Bristol Children\u2019s Hospital"}}}
