A robust decentralized sliding mode control based on static state feedback is developed. By local coordinate transformation and feedback linearization, the interconnected system is transformed to a new regular form. A composite sliding surface which is a function of the system state variables is proposed and the stability of the corresponding sliding mode dynamics is analyzed. A new reachability condition is proposed and a robust decentralized sliding mode control is then designed to drive the system states to the sliding surface in finite time and maintain a sliding motion thereafter. Both uncertainties and interconnections are allowed to be unmatched and are assumed to be bounded by nonlinear functions. The bounds on the uncertainties and interconnections have more general forms when compared with existing work. A MATLAB simulation example is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "AuthorKeywords": ["decentralized control", "nonlinear interconnected systems", "sliding mode control", "static state feedback"], "IndexKeywords": ["Composite sliding", "Local coordinate", "Matlab simulations", "Nonlinear functions", "Nonlinear interconnected systems", "Sliding mode dynamics", "Static state feedback", "System state variables"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078672887", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Aerospace Engineering", "ENGI", "2202"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57203020638": {"Name": "Feng J.", "AuthorID": "57203020638", "AffiliationID": "60105111", "AffiliationName": "College of New Energy, China University of Petroleum (East China)"}, "23112052400": {"Name": "Zhao D.", "AuthorID": "23112052400", "AffiliationID": "60105111", "AffiliationName": "College of New Energy, China University of Petroleum (East China)"}, "7005642573": {"Name": "Spurgeon S.K.", "AuthorID": "7005642573", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic & Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7403595938": {"Name": "Yan X.G.", "AuthorID": "7403595938", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering & Digital Arts, University of Kent"}}}
