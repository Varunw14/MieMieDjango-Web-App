In this work, methods were developed to automate aspects of the transcription process of ancient papyri. First, a technique is proposed that employs color thresholding and contouring for the automatic extraction of symbols from papyri photographs. Second, two symbol classifiers are considered: a support vector machine that intakes Histogram of Oriented Gradients features, and a convolutional neural network. Finally, a novel system is described based on the sliding window approach that limits the number of windows to be considered and uses a combination of a support vector machine and a convolutional neural network to benefit from both accurate and fast detections. The performance of these methods was evaluated on a set of papyri photographs from the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085186171", "SubjectAreas": [["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"57216897483": {"Name": "Haliassos A.", "AuthorID": "57216897483", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "55973201200": {"Name": "Barmpoutis P.", "AuthorID": "55973201200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "7003386658": {"Name": "Stathaki T.", "AuthorID": "7003386658", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "57210082540": {"Name": "Constantinides A.", "AuthorID": "57210082540", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "26646939800": {"Name": "Quirke S.", "AuthorID": "26646939800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}}}
