All rights reserved.Transmission of highly spectral efficient 24.5 GBaud quadrature phase shift keying and 16- and 64-quadrature amplitude modulated signals in the S-band between 1492 nm and 1518 nm wavelength is demonstrated over 55 km few-mode fibers. The carrier lines for S-band transmission were generated by a single wideband optical comb source with more than 120 nm optical bandwidth. While the three-mode fiber was originally optimized for C- and L-band transmission, we show that differential mode delay and mode-dependent loss show only a minor wavelength dependence within the measured S-band channels. However, the transceiver sub-system, including S-band optical amplifiers as well as a reduced optical signal-to-noise ratio of the comb source, leads to a significant Q-factor penalty for channels towards the edges of the S-band optical amplifiers below 1495 nm and above 1515 nm wavelength.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amplitude modulated signals", "Differential Mode Delays", "Few-mode fibers", "Optical band width", "Optical comb sources", "Optical signal to noise ratio", "S-band optical amplifiers", "Wavelength dependence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090380092", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"55419555600": {"Name": "Rademacher G.", "AuthorID": "55419555600", "AffiliationID": "60032325", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Photonic Network System Laboratory"}, "8349788400": {"Name": "Puttnam B.J.", "AuthorID": "8349788400", "AffiliationID": "60032325", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Photonic Network System Laboratory"}, "6602216716": {"Name": "Luis R.S.", "AuthorID": "6602216716", "AffiliationID": "60032325", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Photonic Network System Laboratory"}, "36899733900": {"Name": "Awaji Y.", "AuthorID": "36899733900", "AffiliationID": "60032325", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Photonic Network System Laboratory"}, "15072445200": {"Name": "Furukawa H.", "AuthorID": "15072445200", "AffiliationID": "60032325", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Photonic Network System Laboratory"}, "36192836100": {"Name": "Galdino L.", "AuthorID": "36192836100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, University College London"}, "55800695100": {"Name": "Maruyama R.", "AuthorID": "55800695100", "AffiliationID": "60008392", "AffiliationName": "Fujikura Ltd"}, "36909996200": {"Name": "Aikawa K.", "AuthorID": "36909996200", "AffiliationID": "60008392", "AffiliationName": "Fujikura Ltd"}}}
