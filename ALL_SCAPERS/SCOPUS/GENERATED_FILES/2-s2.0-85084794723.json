Since children are less than 1% of reported cases, there is limited information to develop evidence-based practice recommendations. The objective of this study was to rapidly gather expert knowledge and experience to guide the care of children with chronic kidney disease during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A four-round multi-center Delphi exercise was conducted among 13 centers in 11 European countries of the European Pediatric Dialysis Working Group (EPDWG) between March, 16th and 20th 2020. Results were analyzed using a mixed methods qualitative approach and descriptive statistics. Results: Thirteen COVID-19 specific topics of particular need for guidance were identified. Main themes encompassed testing strategies and results (n = 4), changes in use of current therapeutics (n = 3), preventive measurements of transmission and management of COVID-19 (n = 3), and changes in standard clinical care (n = 3). Patterns of center-specific responses varied according to regulations and to availability of guidelines. Conclusions: As limited quantitative evidence is available in real time during the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, qualitative expert knowledge and experience represent the best evidence available. This Delphi exercise demonstrates that use of mixed methodologies embedded in an established network of experts allowed prompt analysis of pediatric nephrologists\u2019 response to COVID-19 during this fast-emerging public health crisis. Such rapid sharing of knowledge and local practices is essential to timely and optimal guidance for medical management of specific patient groups in multi-country health care systems such as those of Europe and the US.", "AuthorKeywords": ["COVID-19", "Delphi", "Dialysis", "Pandemic", "Transplantation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Coronavirus Infections", "Delphi Technique", "Europe", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Humans", "Infant", "Infection Control", "Pandemics", "Pneumonia, Viral", "Renal Dialysis", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084794723", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"57209712288": {"Name": "Eibensteiner F.", "AuthorID": "57209712288", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pediatric Nephrology and Gastroenterology, Comprehensive Center for Pediatrics, Medical University of Vienna"}, "7004868826": {"Name": "Aufricht C.", "AuthorID": "7004868826", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pediatric Nephrology and Gastroenterology, Comprehensive Center for Pediatrics, Medical University of Vienna"}, "57200656864": {"Name": "Ritschl V.", "AuthorID": "57200656864", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Section for Outcomes Research, Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics, and Intelligent Systems, Medical University of Vienna"}, "7004321698": {"Name": "Stamm T.", "AuthorID": "7004321698", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Section for Outcomes Research, Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics, and Intelligent Systems, Medical University of Vienna"}, "6602702810": {"Name": "Ariceta G.", "AuthorID": "6602702810", "AffiliationID": "60012486", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Nephrology, University Hospital Vall d\u2019 Hebron"}, "6603408774": {"Name": "Jankauskiene A.", "AuthorID": "6603408774", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Center, Institute of Clinical Medicine, Vilnius University"}, "35332541500": {"Name": "Klaus G.", "AuthorID": "35332541500", "AffiliationID": "108908193", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Nephrology, KfH Children\u2019s Kidney Center"}, "6506392620": {"Name": "Paglialonga F.", "AuthorID": "6506392620", "AffiliationID": "60007067", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Nephrology, Dialysis and Transplant Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca\u2019 Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"}, "7005490471": {"Name": "Edefonti A.", "AuthorID": "7005490471", "AffiliationID": "60007067", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Nephrology, Dialysis and Transplant Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca\u2019 Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"}, "56243368600": {"Name": "Ranchin B.", "AuthorID": "56243368600", "AffiliationID": "60012357", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Nephrology, H\u00f4pital Femme M\u00e8re Enfant, Hospices Civils de Lyon"}, "7202056863": {"Name": "Schmitt C.P.", "AuthorID": "7202056863", "AffiliationID": "113056802", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Nephrology, Center for Child and Adolescent Medicine"}, "22956754100": {"Name": "Shroff R.", "AuthorID": "22956754100", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Renal Unit, UCL Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, and Institute of Child Health"}, "6701397962": {"Name": "Stefanidis C.J.", "AuthorID": "6701397962", "AffiliationID": "60021061", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Nephrology, Mitera Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "12760188700": {"Name": "Walle J.V.", "AuthorID": "12760188700", "AffiliationID": "60068590", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Nephrology, Utoped, Universitair Ziekenhuis Gent"}, "57190109873": {"Name": "Verrina E.", "AuthorID": "57190109873", "AffiliationID": "60016041", "AffiliationName": "Dialysis Unit, Department of Pediatrics, IRCCS Giannina Gaslini"}, "6603032157": {"Name": "Vondrak K.", "AuthorID": "6603032157", "AffiliationID": "60023469", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Nephrology, University Hospital Motol"}, "6701634473": {"Name": "Zurowska A.", "AuthorID": "6701634473", "AffiliationID": "60012383", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Nephrology, Medical University of Gdansk"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
