We derive photometric redshifts for \u2248176 000 sources down to i\u00c1B \u223c 24 and present photometric redshifts for 1.4 GHz expanded Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network (e-MERLIN) and Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) detected radio sources found in the central 0.26 deg2. We compile an initial catalogue of 149 radio sources brighter than S1.4 > 75 \u03bcJy and find their photometric redshifts span 0 < zphot < 4 with radio luminosities between 1021 and 1025 W Hz\u22121, with medians of \u3008z\u3009 = 0.55 and \u3008L1.4\u3009 = 1.9 \u00d7 1023 W Hz\u22121, respectively. We find 95 per cent of the \u03bcJy radio source sample (141/149) have spectral energy distributions (SEDs) best fit by star-forming templates while 5 per cent (8/149) are better fit by active galactic nuclei (AGN). Spectral indices are calculated for sources with radio observations from the VLA and Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) at 325 MHz, with an average spectral slope of \u03b1 = 0.59 \u00b1 0.04. Using the full photometric redshift catalogue, we construct a density map at the redshift of the known galaxy clusters, z = 0.20 \u00b1 0.08. Four of the five clusters are prominently detected at > 7 \u03c3 in the density map and we confirm the photometric redshifts are consistent with previously measured spectra from a few galaxies at the cluster centres.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cosmology: observations", "Galaxies: distances and redshifts", "Galaxies: photometry"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096951441", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57195060999": {"Name": "Manning S.M.", "AuthorID": "57195060999", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy, University of Texas at Austin"}, "25651345000": {"Name": "Casey C.M.", "AuthorID": "25651345000", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy, University of Texas at Austin"}, "57200114637": {"Name": "Drew P.", "AuthorID": "57200114637", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy, University of Texas at Austin"}, "55009695400": {"Name": "Hung C.L.", "AuthorID": "55009695400", "AffiliationID": "60017789", "AffiliationName": "Physics Department, Manhattan College"}, "57202570229": {"Name": "Battye R.", "AuthorID": "57202570229", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Manchester"}, "57205381665": {"Name": "Brown M.L.", "AuthorID": "57205381665", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Manchester"}, "7202097638": {"Name": "Jackson N.", "AuthorID": "7202097638", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Manchester"}, "56872971400": {"Name": "Demetroullas C.", "AuthorID": "56872971400", "AffiliationID": "60077474", "AffiliationName": "Cyprus University of Technology"}, "57190308522": {"Name": "Harrison I.", "AuthorID": "57190308522", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Oxford, Denys Wilkinson Building"}, "7403653187": {"Name": "Watson R.A.", "AuthorID": "7403653187", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Manchester"}, "15841786900": {"Name": "Abdalla F.", "AuthorID": "15841786900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57203028521": {"Name": "Chapman S.", "AuthorID": "57203028521", "AffiliationID": "60015913", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Atmospheric Science, Dalhousie University"}, "55976935700": {"Name": "Hales C.A.", "AuthorID": "55976935700", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics, Statistics and Physics, Newcastle University"}, "56512198400": {"Name": "Riseley C.J.", "AuthorID": "56512198400", "AffiliationID": "124821497", "AffiliationName": "CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science"}, "35401143000": {"Name": "Sanders D.B.", "AuthorID": "35401143000", "AffiliationID": "60013791, 60029042", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Astronomy, University of Hawaii"}}}
