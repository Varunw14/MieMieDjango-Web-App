In addition, this study investigated what factors in feet movements and eye behaviours can be used to show effectiveness of the preventive measures of tripping. Healthy 12 young and 5 older participants joined this study. A walkway (9.6 m length \u00d7 1.2 m width) with a single step chosen from 0, 10, and 25 mm in one of three positions 4.8, 6, and 7.2 m from the start line, was used for measurement of feet movements and eye behaviours in stepping over. Principal component analysis demonstrated to evaluate pedestrian capability of stepping over the single step and showed differences between young and older groups. First principal component might show different walking style, second principal component might show foot strategy of stepping over the single step, and third principal component might show that awareness of the single step. The awareness level of 25 mm step by older group was similar level of the awareness of 10 mm by young group, and older group was struggle to aware 10 mm step, compared with 0 mm case. These findings might be useful to consider how to improve outdoor and indoor environments as well as to assess how physical training, preventive measures, and assistive technologies to reduce the risk of tripping in stepping over the single step.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Eye behaviours", "Feet movements", "Principal component analysis", "Single step", "Tripping"], "IndexKeywords": ["Assistive technology", "Eye behaviours", "Feet movements", "First principal components", "Preventive measures", "Principal Components", "Single-step", "Tripping"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075860134", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"14012223300": {"Name": "Suzuki T.", "AuthorID": "14012223300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Pedestrian Accessibility Movement Environment Laboratory, Department of Civil, Environment, Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "57039002600": {"Name": "Papadosifos N.", "AuthorID": "57039002600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Pedestrian Accessibility Movement Environment Laboratory, Department of Civil, Environment, Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "56656649100": {"Name": "Boampong D.", "AuthorID": "56656649100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Pedestrian Accessibility Movement Environment Laboratory, Department of Civil, Environment, Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "57212082612": {"Name": "Liu I.", "AuthorID": "57212082612", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environment, Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "57212090233": {"Name": "Fung P.", "AuthorID": "57212090233", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environment, Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "7006815425": {"Name": "Tyler N.", "AuthorID": "7006815425", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environment, Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
