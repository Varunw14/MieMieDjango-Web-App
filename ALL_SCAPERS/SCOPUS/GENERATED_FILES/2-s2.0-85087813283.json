Advances in in vivo measurements of AD neuropathology using brain imaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and/or blood biomarkers have led to research in AD that uses in vivo biomarkers as outcomes, focusing primarily on amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration as constructs. Studies of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and AD biomarkers seem to show that T2DM is not related to amyloid deposition, but is related to neurodegeneration and tau deposition. There is a dearth of studies examining adiposity, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome in relation to AD biomarkers and the associations in these studies are inconsistent. Metabolomics studies have reported associations of unsaturated fatty acids with AD neuropathology at autopsy, and sphingolipids and glycerophospholipids in relation to neurodegeneration and amyloid and tau. There are other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Lewy body disease that may overlap with AD, and specific biomarkers for these pathologies are being developed and should be integrated into AD biomarker research. More longitudinal studies are needed with concurrent assessment of metabolic factors and AD biomarkers in order to improve the opportunity to assess causality. Ideally, AD biomarkers should be integrated into clinical trials of interventions that affect metabolic factors. Advances in blood-based AD biomarkers, which are less costly and invasive compared with CSF and brain imaging biomarkers, could facilitate widespread implementation of AD biomarkers in studies examining the metabolic contribution to AD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adiposity", "Alzheimer's disease", "Biomarkers", "Brain imaging", "Cerebrospinal fluid", "Insulin resistance", "Metabolic syndrome", "Metabolomics", "Plasma", "Type 2 diabetes mellitus"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087813283", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"6603974160": {"Name": "Luchsinger J.A.", "AuthorID": "6603974160", "AffiliationID": "60027565", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Medicine and Epidemiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center"}, "57208899083": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "57208899083", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL"}}}
