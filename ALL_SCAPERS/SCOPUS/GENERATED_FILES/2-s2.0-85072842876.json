Setting: Moorfields Eye Hospital, London, England. Design: Retrospective case series. Methods: Data on all patients with anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, and panuveitis who had anterior-fixated Artisan IOL insertion between January 2014 and July 2019 at Moorfields Eye Hospital were assessed. Patients who had less than 2 months of follow-up were excluded from the analysis. Results: The study comprised 11 patients. The mean age of the 7 women and 4 men was 61 years \u00b1 14 (SD). The mean follow-up was 1.7 years. After Artisan IOL insertion, the corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) improved significantly from 20/200 to 20/50 (P =.02). No patients had a significant flare-up of their uveitis after the surgery, and there were no intraocular pressure-related events. One patient developed cystoid macular edema, which responded to treatment. Conclusion: This case series showed the efficacy and safety of Artisan-style IOLs in patients with a history of uveitis. After the Artisan IOL insertions, these patients experienced a significant improvement in CDVA with minimal side effects.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aphakia, Postcataract", "Female", "Humans", "Iris", "Lens Implantation, Intraocular", "Lenses, Intraocular", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prosthesis Design", "Retrospective Studies", "Uveitis", "Visual Acuity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072842876", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"]], "AuthorData": {"55297894600": {"Name": "Negretti G.S.", "AuthorID": "55297894600", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Vitreoretinal Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "25026976000": {"Name": "Chan W.O.", "AuthorID": "25026976000", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Vitreoretinal Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "57203157173": {"Name": "Muqit M.M.K.", "AuthorID": "57203157173", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Vitreoretinal Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7003495942": {"Name": "Pavesio C.", "AuthorID": "7003495942", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Medical Retina and Uveitis Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}}}
