While direct measurement remains the most appropriate way of collecting such data, it is impractical at large scales. Instead, household surveys based upon informant recall of fish caught and/or consumed are frequently used. However, the accuracy of weight recall by informants (even over short recall periods) has not been established. Using data from household surveys, the accuracy and precision of catch and consumption estimates derived from: (a) asking informants to recall weights of fish caught and (b) asking respondents to recall lengths of fish caught and converting to weight were tested. Length-based methods, using visual aids to assist recall, were more accurate, precise and correctable. These methods could be useful for catch estimation, especially where fish are processed, sold or consumed shortly after capture.", "AuthorKeywords": ["catch estimation", "food security", "household surveys", "nutrition", "resource management", "respondent recall"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077157514", "SubjectAreas": [["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"]], "AuthorData": {"9742848300": {"Name": "Garaway C.", "AuthorID": "9742848300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University College London"}, "14014272300": {"Name": "Arthur R.", "AuthorID": "14014272300", "AffiliationID": "60170140", "AffiliationName": "MRAG Ltd"}}}
