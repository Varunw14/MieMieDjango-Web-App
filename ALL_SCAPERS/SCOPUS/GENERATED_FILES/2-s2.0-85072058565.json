The presentation in affected individuals is variable, with a diversity of tissues demonstrating abnormalities. Common manifestations include skin and bony overgrowth, vascular malformations (VMs), cysts and benign tumors. We used two methods to create mouse models that had endogenously-regulated mosaic expression of the Proteus syndrome variant. Variant allele fractions (VAFs) ranged from 0% to 50% across numerous tissues in 44 Proteus syndrome mice. Mice were phenotypically heterogeneous with lesions rarely observed before 12 months of age. VMs were the most frequent finding with a total of 69 found in 29 of 44 Proteus syndrome mice. Twenty-eight cysts and ectasia, frequently biliary, were seen in 22 of 44 Proteus syndrome mice. Varying levels of mammary hyperplasia were seen in 10 of 16 female Proteus syndrome mice with other localized regions of hyperplasia and stromal expansion noted in several additional animals. Interestingly, 27 of 31 Proteus syndrome animals had non-zero blood VAF that is in contrast to the human disorder where it is rarely seen in peripheral blood. Identification of variant-positive cells by green fluorescent protein (GFP) staining in chimeric Proteus syndrome mice showed that in some lesions, hyperplastic cells were predominantly GFP/Akt1E17K-positive and showed increased pAKT signal compared to GFP-negative cells. However, hyperplastic mammary epithelium was a mixture of GFP/Akt1E17K-positive and negative cells with some GFP/Akt1E17K-negative cells also having increased pAKT signal suggesting that the variant-positive cells can induce lesion formation in a non-cell autonomous manner.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alleles", "Animals", "Biopsy", "Disease Models, Animal", "Genetic Association Studies", "Genetic Loci", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genotype", "Humans", "Mice", "Mutation", "Phenotype", "Proteus Syndrome", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072058565", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"15048278600": {"Name": "Lindhurst M.J.", "AuthorID": "15048278600", "AffiliationID": "60013369, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Medical Genomics and Metabolic Genetics Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, NIH"}, "57201476717": {"Name": "Kondolf H.C.", "AuthorID": "57201476717", "AffiliationID": "60000305", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University"}, "57210444929": {"Name": "Shwetar J.J.", "AuthorID": "57210444929", "AffiliationID": "60013369, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Medical Genomics and Metabolic Genetics Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, NIH"}, "57000533800": {"Name": "Yourick M.R.", "AuthorID": "57000533800", "AffiliationID": "60020304", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Maryland"}, "57210967009": {"Name": "Shiferaw H.", "AuthorID": "57210967009", "AffiliationID": "60013369, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Medical Genomics and Metabolic Genetics Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, NIH"}, "6603177196": {"Name": "Keppler-Noreuil K.M.", "AuthorID": "6603177196", "AffiliationID": "60013369, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Medical Genomics and Metabolic Genetics Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, NIH"}, "7005532738": {"Name": "Biesecker L.G.", "AuthorID": "7005532738", "AffiliationID": "60013369, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Medical Genomics and Metabolic Genetics Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, NIH"}, "8529198900": {"Name": "Brinster L.R.", "AuthorID": "8529198900", "AffiliationID": "60006577", "AffiliationName": "Division of Veterinary Resources, Office of Research Services, NIH"}, "25031368400": {"Name": "Elliot G.", "AuthorID": "25031368400", "AffiliationID": "60013369, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Genetic Disease Research Branch, NHGRI, NIH"}, "55573243200": {"Name": "Rivas C.", "AuthorID": "55573243200", "AffiliationID": "60013369, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Genetic Disease Research Branch, NHGRI, NIH"}, "7101934527": {"Name": "Garrett L.", "AuthorID": "7101934527", "AffiliationID": "60013369, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Genetic Disease Research Branch, NHGRI, NIH"}, "16836550300": {"Name": "Gomez-Rodriguez J.", "AuthorID": "16836550300", "AffiliationID": "60017336, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Immune System Biology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH"}, "7006989606": {"Name": "Schwartzberg P.L.", "AuthorID": "7006989606", "AffiliationID": "60005723", "AffiliationName": "Division of Genetics and Metabolism, Children's National Medical Center"}, "57049165000": {"Name": "Sebire N.J.", "AuthorID": "57049165000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Histopathology Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital NIHR Biomedical Research Centre"}, "7103254557": {"Name": "Hewitt S.M.", "AuthorID": "7103254557", "AffiliationID": "60013409, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, NIH"}}}
