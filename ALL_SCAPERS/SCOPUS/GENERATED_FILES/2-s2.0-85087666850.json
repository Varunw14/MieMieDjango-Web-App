Here, we demonstrate the synthesis and characterization of Fe-intercalated ZrSe2 thin films on quartz substrates using the low-pressure chemical vapor deposition of the single-source precursor [Fe(\u03b75-C5H4Se)2Zr(\u03b75-C5H5)2]2. Powder X-ray diffraction of the film scraping and subsequent Rietveld refinement of the data showed the successful synthesis of the Fe0.14ZrSe2 phase, along with secondary phases of FeSe and ZrO2. Upon intercalation, a small optical band gap enhancement (Eg(direct)opt = 1.72 eV) is detected in comparison with that of the host material.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087666850", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"57189844658": {"Name": "Sanchez-Perez C.", "AuthorID": "57189844658", "AffiliationID": "60012954", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Inorganic Chemistry, Environmental and Chemical Engineering, University of Oulu"}, "24923462200": {"Name": "Knapp C.E.", "AuthorID": "24923462200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56119704200": {"Name": "Sotelo-Vazquez C.", "AuthorID": "56119704200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "37081732100": {"Name": "Sathasivam S.", "AuthorID": "37081732100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003437916": {"Name": "Carmalt C.J.", "AuthorID": "7003437916", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6603920507": {"Name": "Oilunkaniemi R.", "AuthorID": "6603920507", "AffiliationID": "60012954", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Inorganic Chemistry, Environmental and Chemical Engineering, University of Oulu"}, "7006780968": {"Name": "Laitinen R.S.", "AuthorID": "7006780968", "AffiliationID": "60012954", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Inorganic Chemistry, Environmental and Chemical Engineering, University of Oulu"}, "35200560300": {"Name": "Colman R.H.", "AuthorID": "35200560300", "AffiliationID": "60016605", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University"}}}
