Although this system is able to function, the durability of the film has been an issue as the surface of the films may oxidize by converting V4+ to V5+. To overcome this problem, attempt is made to coat the VO2 film with ZnO, which can assist by creating a resistance layer to prevent further oxidation of VO2. Here, VO2/ZnO bilayer film was prepared by a facile method comprised of spin-coating and dip-coating process and shows excellent durability, and in particular. the solar modulation efficiency (\u25b3Tsol) maintaining ca 89.9% (from 17.8% to 16.0%) after 300 days in a humid environment, however, the \u25b3Tsol of pure VO2 film is decreased from 11.8% to 4.1%. Also, the VO2/ZnO bilayer exhibits an enhanced thermochromic property of visible transmittance (Tlum = 55.7 \u00b1 2.1%) and \u25b3Tsol (17.1 \u00b1 1.4%) which is 1.49 times higher than that of pure VO2 film (\u25b3Tsol = 11.5 \u00b1 0.4%). The enhancement in the thermochromic performance and durability is probably attributed to the anti-reflection and protection of ZnO layer. Therefore, this work can provide an effective way to optimize thermochromic property for practical application of VO2-based smart windows.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Durability", "Smart windows", "Thermochromic", "VO2/ZnO bilayer film"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti reflection", "Bi-layer films", "Dip-coating process", "Humid environment", "Solar modulation", "Thermo-chromic", "Thermochromic properties", "Visible transmittance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095970445", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Surfaces and Interfaces", "PHYS", "3110"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"]], "AuthorData": {"57216746567": {"Name": "Fang Z.", "AuthorID": "57216746567", "AffiliationID": "60022414", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Silicate Materials for Architectures, Wuhan University of Technology (WUT)"}, "53985320000": {"Name": "Tian S.", "AuthorID": "53985320000", "AffiliationID": "60022414", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Silicate Materials for Architectures, Wuhan University of Technology (WUT)"}, "57203376297": {"Name": "Li B.", "AuthorID": "57203376297", "AffiliationID": "60022414", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Silicate Materials for Architectures, Wuhan University of Technology (WUT)"}, "57203965666": {"Name": "Liu Q.", "AuthorID": "57203965666", "AffiliationID": "60022414", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Silicate Materials for Architectures, Wuhan University of Technology (WUT)"}, "7408690803": {"Name": "Liu B.", "AuthorID": "7408690803", "AffiliationID": "60022414", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Silicate Materials for Architectures, Wuhan University of Technology (WUT)"}, "7407542254": {"Name": "Zhao X.", "AuthorID": "7407542254", "AffiliationID": "60022414", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Silicate Materials for Architectures, Wuhan University of Technology (WUT)"}, "7006847733": {"Name": "Sankar G.", "AuthorID": "7006847733", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Materials Chemistry Centre, University College London"}}}
