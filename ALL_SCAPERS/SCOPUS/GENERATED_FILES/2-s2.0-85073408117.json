Here, we develop modelling methods that capture elements of each of these factors, to predict the risk of Ebola virus disease (EVD) across time and space. Our modelling results match previously-observed outbreak patterns with high accuracy, and suggest further outbreaks could occur across most of West and Central Africa. Trends in the underlying drivers of EVD risk suggest a 1.75 to 3.2-fold increase in the endemic rate of animal-human viral spill-overs in Africa by 2070, given current modes of healthcare intervention. Future global change scenarios with higher human population growth and lower rates of socio-economic development yield a fourfold higher likelihood of epidemics occurring as a result of spill-over events. Our modelling framework can be used to target interventions designed to reduce epidemic risk for many zoonotic diseases.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Africa", "Animals", "Communicable Diseases, Emerging", "Disease Outbreaks", "Ebolavirus", "Environment", "Epidemics", "Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola", "Humans", "Risk Factors", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Zoonoses"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073408117", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"15519931200": {"Name": "Redding D.W.", "AuthorID": "15519931200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research, Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "7404728090": {"Name": "Jones K.E.", "AuthorID": "7404728090", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London, Regent\u2019s Park"}, "7201906181": {"Name": "Atkinson P.M.", "AuthorID": "7201906181", "AffiliationID": "60117630, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "Lancaster Environment Centre, Lancaster University"}, "57203051586": {"Name": "Cunningham A.A.", "AuthorID": "57203051586", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London, Regent\u2019s Park"}, "8872239200": {"Name": "Lo Iacono G.", "AuthorID": "8872239200", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Surrey"}, "8905660300": {"Name": "Moses L.M.", "AuthorID": "8905660300", "AffiliationID": "60017672", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Community Health and Behavioral Sciences, Tulane University"}, "7404353992": {"Name": "Wood J.L.N.", "AuthorID": "7404353992", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Veterinary Medicine, Disease Dynamics Unit, University of Cambridge"}}}
