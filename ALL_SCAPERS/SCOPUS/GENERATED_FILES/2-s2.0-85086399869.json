Despite the high heritability and numerous previous association studies, only 8.5% of CCT variance is currently explained. Here, we report the results of a multiethnic meta-analysis of available genome-wide association studies in which we find association between CCT and 98 genomic loci, of which 41 are novel. Among these loci, 20 were significantly associated with keratoconus, and one (RAPSN rs3740685) was significantly associated with glaucoma after Bonferroni correction. Two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis suggests that thinner CCT does not causally increase the risk of primary open-angle glaucoma. This large CCT study explains up to 14.2% of CCT variance and increases substantially our understanding of the etiology of CCT variation. This may open new avenues of investigation into human ocular traits and their relationship to the risk of vision disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086399869", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"]], "AuthorData": {"57212854101": {"Name": "Choquet H.", "AuthorID": "57212854101", "AffiliationID": "60017457, 60022056", "AffiliationName": "Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), Division of Research"}, "57193009775": {"Name": "Yin J.", "AuthorID": "57193009775", "AffiliationID": "60017457, 60022056", "AffiliationName": "Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), Division of Research"}, "57215521550": {"Name": "Thai K.K.", "AuthorID": "57215521550", "AffiliationID": "60017457, 60022056", "AffiliationName": "Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), Division of Research"}, "7202212082": {"Name": "Schaefer C.", "AuthorID": "7202212082", "AffiliationID": "60017457, 60022056", "AffiliationName": "Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), Division of Research"}, "57207897529": {"Name": "Risch N.", "AuthorID": "57207897529", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, UCSF"}, "57216999620": {"Name": "Jorgenson E.", "AuthorID": "57216999620", "AffiliationID": "60017457, 60022056", "AffiliationName": "Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), Division of Research"}, "57042509000": {"Name": "Melles R.B.", "AuthorID": "57042509000", "AffiliationID": "119929025", "AffiliationName": "KPNC, Department of Ophthalmology"}, "55557672300": {"Name": "Hoffmann T.J.", "AuthorID": "55557672300", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, UCSF"}, "6603025833": {"Name": "Kvale M.N.", "AuthorID": "6603025833", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Human Genetics, University of California San Francisco (UCSF)"}, "57192889873": {"Name": "Banda Y.", "AuthorID": "57192889873", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Human Genetics, University of California San Francisco (UCSF)"}, "57214717859": {"Name": "Glymour M.M.", "AuthorID": "57214717859", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, UCSF"}, "57197636332": {"Name": "Hardcastle A.J.", "AuthorID": "57197636332", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Health Research Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology, and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7004454391": {"Name": "Tuft S.J.", "AuthorID": "7004454391", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "11439548100": {"Name": "Nair K.S.", "AuthorID": "11439548100", "AffiliationID": "60031970, 60023691", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Ophthalmology and Anatomy, School of Medicine, UCSF"}, "57203644841": {"Name": "Hysi P.G.", "AuthorID": "57203644841", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Great Ormond Street Hospital Institute of Child Health"}}}
