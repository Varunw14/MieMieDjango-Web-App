This population receives care from various professionals, depending on local care pathways. This study evaluates the training status, confidence, reported assessment and management practices of different professional groups involved in caring for people with ID, epilepsy and CB. Methods: A cross sectional survey using a questionnaire developed by expert consensus which measured self-reported training status, confidence, and approaches to assessment and management of CB in people with ID and epilepsy was distributed to practitioners involved in epilepsy and/or ID. Results: Of the 83 respondents, the majority had either a psychiatry/ID (n = 39), or Neurology/epileptology background (n = 31). Psychiatry/ID and Neurology/epileptology had similar confidence in assessing CB in ID-epilepsy cases, but Psychiatry/ID exhibited higher self-rated confidence in the management of these cases. While assessing and managing CB, Psychiatry/ID appeared more likely to consider mental health aspects, while Neurology/epileptology typically focused on ASM. Conclusion: Psychiatry/ID and Neurology/epileptology professionals had varying training levels in epilepsy, ID and CB, had differing confidence levels in managing this patient population, and considered different factors when approaching assessment and management. As such, training opportunities in ID should be offered to neurology professionals, and vice versa. Based on the findings, a best practice checklist is presented, which aims to provide clinicians with a structured framework to consider causal explanations for CB in this population.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anti-seizure medication", "epilepsy", "Learning disability"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089146991", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"36456797300": {"Name": "Kinney M.O.", "AuthorID": "36456797300", "AffiliationID": "60008028, 60030456", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, The Royal Victoria Hospital (Belfast Health and Social Care Trust)"}, "55257894500": {"Name": "Chester V.", "AuthorID": "55257894500", "AffiliationID": "60117932, 60000112", "AffiliationName": "Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia"}, "8529899500": {"Name": "Alexander R.T.", "AuthorID": "8529899500", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "School of Life and Medical Sciences, University of Hertfordshire"}, "56925199300": {"Name": "Tromans S.", "AuthorID": "56925199300", "AffiliationID": "60171752", "AffiliationName": "Department of Intellectual Disability, Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust, Agnes Unit"}, "15724534700": {"Name": "Angus-Leppan H.", "AuthorID": "15724534700", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "6508272593": {"Name": "Bagary M.", "AuthorID": "6508272593", "AffiliationID": "60099531", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Foundation Trust"}, "55940072800": {"Name": "Cock H.", "AuthorID": "55940072800", "AffiliationID": "60032542", "AffiliationName": "Atkinson Morley Regional Epilepsy Network, St Georges Epilepsy Group, St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "23492202000": {"Name": "Devapriam J.", "AuthorID": "23492202000", "AffiliationID": "60171753", "AffiliationName": "Worcestershire Health & Care NHS Trust"}, "6701753786": {"Name": "Hassiotis A.", "AuthorID": "6701753786", "AffiliationID": "60161451", "AffiliationName": "Camden & Islington NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57216643123": {"Name": "Mula M.", "AuthorID": "57216643123", "AffiliationID": "60032542, 60029329", "AffiliationName": "St George's University Hospital, St George's University of London"}, "7102183040": {"Name": "Reuber M.", "AuthorID": "7102183040", "AffiliationID": "60001881, 60006444", "AffiliationName": "Academic Neurology Unit, University of Sheffield, Royal Hallamshire Hospital"}, "7005682063": {"Name": "Ring H.", "AuthorID": "7005682063", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Group, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge"}, "7402704771": {"Name": "Roy A.", "AuthorID": "7402704771", "AffiliationID": "60101776", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry of Intellectual Disability, Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust"}, "55919024700": {"Name": "Scheepers M.", "AuthorID": "55919024700", "AffiliationID": "60172292", "AffiliationName": "Gloucestershire Health & Care NHS Foundation Trust, Leckhamptom Lodge"}, "24173533500": {"Name": "Shankar R.", "AuthorID": "24173533500", "AffiliationID": "60170524", "AffiliationName": "Cornwall Partnership NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
