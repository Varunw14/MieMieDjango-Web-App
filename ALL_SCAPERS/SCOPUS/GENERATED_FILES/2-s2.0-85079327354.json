All rights reserved.Uncertainty plays a critical role in reinforcement learning and decision making. However, exactly how it influences behavior remains unclear. Multiarmed-bandit tasks offer an ideal test bed, since computational tools such as approximate Kalman filters can closely characterize the interplay between trial-by-trial values, uncertainty, learning, and choice. To gain additional insight into learning and choice processes, we obtained data from subjects\u2019 overt allocation of gaze. The estimated value and estimation uncertainty of options influenced what subjects looked at before choosing; these same quantities also influenced choice, as additionally did fixation itself. A momentary measure of uncertainty in the form of absolute prediction errors determined how long participants looked at the obtained outcomes. These findings affirm the importance of uncertainty in multiple facets of behavior and help delineate its effects on decision making.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Decision making", "Exploration\u2013exploitation", "Reinforcement learning", "Uncertainty", "Visual fixation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Algorithms", "Decision Making", "Exploratory Behavior", "Female", "Fixation, Ocular", "Humans", "Male", "Reinforcement, Psychology", "Task Performance and Analysis", "Uncertainty", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079327354", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"54797384600": {"Name": "Stoji\u0107 H.", "AuthorID": "54797384600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60122566", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research, University College London"}, "57210439880": {"Name": "Dolan R.J.", "AuthorID": "57210439880", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60122566", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research, University College London"}, "55199940500": {"Name": "Orquin J.L.", "AuthorID": "55199940500", "AffiliationID": "60071140", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Research in Marketing and Consumer Psychology, Reykjavik University"}, "7006914663": {"Name": "Dayan P.", "AuthorID": "7006914663", "AffiliationID": "60004898", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computational Neuroscience, Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics"}, "23470488800": {"Name": "Speekenbrink M.", "AuthorID": "23470488800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}}}
