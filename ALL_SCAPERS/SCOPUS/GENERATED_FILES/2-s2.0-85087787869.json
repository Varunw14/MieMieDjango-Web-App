This paper is a sequel to the authors\u2019 articles (Paik et al. 2020a, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.istruc.2020.05.026 and Paik et al. 2020b, https://doi.org/10.1080/17445302.2020.1787930). In contrast to the earlier articles associated with room temperature or cryogenic condition, this paper investigated the effect of a low temperature at \u221280\u00b0C which is within the boundary range of temperature of the ductile-to-brittle fracture transition for carbon steels. A material model representing the test conditions was also proposed to capture the characteristics of carbon steels at low temperatures both in tension and in compression, and it was used in finite element method simulations of the full-scale experiment. A comparison between numerical analyses and experiments showed that the proposed model could successfully predict the failure modes and ultimate strength characteristics at low temperatures for stiffened plate structures under axial compressive loading conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cryogenic condition", "Ductile-to-brittle fracture transition temperature", "full-scale collapse testing", "low temperature", "steel stiffened plate structures", "ultimate compressive strength"], "IndexKeywords": ["Axial compressive loading", "Collapse testing", "Cryogenic conditions", "Finite element method simulation", "Full-scale experiment", "Low temperatures", "Material modeling", "Ultimate strength"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087787869", "SubjectAreas": [["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"35821146600": {"Name": "Paik J.K.", "AuthorID": "35821146600", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "Department of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Pusan National University"}, "36911790200": {"Name": "Park D.K.", "AuthorID": "36911790200", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "The Korea Ship and Offshore Research Institute (The International Centre for Advanced Safety Studies, The Lloyd\u2019s Register Foundation Research Centre of Excellence), Pusan National University"}, "57202974921": {"Name": "Lee D.H.", "AuthorID": "57202974921", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "Department of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Pusan National University"}, "6602749403": {"Name": "Ringsberg J.W.", "AuthorID": "6602749403", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanics and Maritime Sciences, Chalmers University of Technology"}}}
