Studies examining the progress made since the adoption of res. 1325 point to different challenges that still persist for its effective implementation. One of the main challenges is perceived to be the lack of commitments from local governments, especially with regard to resource allocation for implementation. Although a growing number of UN member states have adopted national action plans (NAPs) on res. 1325, only 34% of them have allocated budgets for their implementation. This study examines the implementation of one of the most praised NAPs, the Nepal NAP 2011. The study reveals that the effectiveness of the WPS agenda relies on many actors, not just the government. The role of international donors is equally crucial. In countries like Nepal, where a large portion of the development budget comes from international donors, giving sole responsibility for the implementation of the WPS agenda to the government limits its transformative potential and raises questions around the accountability of the international community.", "AuthorKeywords": ["National Action Plan on Resolution 1325", "Nepal", "Peace and Security (WPS)", "UNSCR 1325", "Women", "Women and War"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086855109", "SubjectAreas": [["Gender Studies", "SOCI", "3318"], ["Development", "SOCI", "3303"]], "AuthorData": {"57215650949": {"Name": "Yadav P.", "AuthorID": "57215650949", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Gender and Disaster, Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, University College London"}}}
