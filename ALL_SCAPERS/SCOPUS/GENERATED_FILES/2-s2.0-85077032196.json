A finite element model has been developed based on the multiple-network poroelastic theory to investigate transport phenomenon in such biological systems. The governing equations and boundary conditions are adapted for the cerebral environment as an example. The numerical model is verified against analytical solutions of classical consolidation problems and validated using experimental data of infusion tests. It is then applied to three-dimensional subject-specific modelling of brain, including anatomically realistic geometry, personalised permeability map and arterial blood supply to the brain. Numerical results of smoking and non-smoking subjects show hypoperfusion in the brains of smoking subjects, which also demonstrate that the numerical model is capable of capturing spatio-temporal fluid transport in biological systems across different scales.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brain", "Finite element method", "Multiple fluids", "Poroelasticity", "Subject-specific modelling", "Transport phenomenon"], "IndexKeywords": ["Governing equations", "Interstitial fluids", "Multiple fluids", "Poro-elasticity", "Poroelastic theory", "Realistic geometry", "Subject-specific", "Transport phenomena"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077032196", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"56999470200": {"Name": "Guo L.", "AuthorID": "56999470200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "56039685400": {"Name": "Vardakis J.", "AuthorID": "56039685400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "6603704133": {"Name": "Ventikos Y.", "AuthorID": "6603704133", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "56999958600": {"Name": "Chou D.", "AuthorID": "56999958600", "AffiliationID": "60024666", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Central University"}}}
