Human adipose stem cells (ADSCs) can differentiate into bone and cartilage and together with suitable scaffolds could provide a promising system for skeletal tissue engineering. It has been suggested that nanomaterials can direct cell behavior depending on their surface nanotopographies. Thus, this study examined whether by altering a nanoscaffold surface using radiofrequency to excite gases, argon (Ar), nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2) with a single step technique, we could enhance the osteogenic and chondrogenic potential of ADSCs. At 24 h, Ar modification promoted the highest increase in ADSCs adhesion as indicated by upregulation of vinculin and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) expression compared to O2 and N2 scaffolds. Furthermore, ADSCs on Ar-modified nanocomposite polymer POSS-PCU scaffolds upregulated expression of bone markers, alkaline phosphatase, collagen I and osteocalcin after 3 weeks. Cartilage markers, aggrecan and collagen II, were also upregulated on Ar-modified scaffolds at the mRNA and protein level. Finally, all plasma treated scaffolds supported tissue ingrowth and angiogenesis after grafting onto the chick chorioallantoic membrane. Ar promoted greater expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and laminin in ovo compared to O2 and N2 scaffolds as shown by immunohistochemistry. This study provides an important understanding into which surface chemistries best support the osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation of ADSCs that could be harnessed for regenerative skeletal applications. Argon surface modification is a simple tool that can promote ADSC skeletal differentiation that is easily amenable to translation into clinical practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adipose stem cells", "Argon", "Chondrogensis", "Osteogenesis", "Plasma surface modification"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adipose derived stem cells", "Adipose stem cells", "Chick chorioallantoic membrane", "Chondrogenic differentiation", "Chondrogensis", "Osteogenesis", "Plasma surface modifications", "Vascular endothelial growth factor", "Adipose Tissue", "Argon", "Cell Differentiation", "Cells, Cultured", "Chondrogenesis", "Humans", "Nanocomposites", "Osteogenesis", "Plasma Gases", "Polyurethanes", "Stem Cells", "Tissue Engineering", "Tissue Scaffolds"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071654548", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"36833858100": {"Name": "Griffin M.F.", "AuthorID": "36833858100", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Section, UCL Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7005344804": {"Name": "Seifalian A.M.", "AuthorID": "7005344804", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nanotechnology and Regenerative Medicine, Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London"}, "35549898400": {"Name": "Butler P.E.M.", "AuthorID": "35549898400", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust Hospital"}, "24070966200": {"Name": "Kalaskar D.M.", "AuthorID": "24070966200", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust Hospital"}, "57191972340": {"Name": "Ibrahim A.", "AuthorID": "57191972340", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Section, UCL Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57220386665": {"Name": "Ferretti P.", "AuthorID": "57220386665", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Section, UCL Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
