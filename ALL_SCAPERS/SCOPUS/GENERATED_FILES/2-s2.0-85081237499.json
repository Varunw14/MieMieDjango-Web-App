Nanoparticles that load and deliver drugs and genes have been intensively studied for the treatment of brain diseases, and have demonstrated some biological effects in various animal models. Among other efforts taken in the nanoparticle development, targeting of blood brain barrier, specific cell type or local intra-/extra-cellular space is an important strategy to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of the nanoparticle delivery systems. This review underlies the targeting issue in the nanoparticle development for the treatment of brain diseases, taking key exemplar studies carried out in various in vivo models.", "AuthorKeywords": ["blood brain barrier", "Brain diseases", "in vivo models", "nanoparticles", "targeting"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081237499", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"27171822300": {"Name": "Jin G.Z.", "AuthorID": "27171822300", "AffiliationID": "60002877", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nanobiomedical Science, BK21 PLUS Global Research Center for Regenerative Medicine, Dankook University"}, "56045393200": {"Name": "Chakraborty A.", "AuthorID": "56045393200", "AffiliationID": "60170569, 60002877", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Tissue Regeneration Engineering (ITREN), Dankook University"}, "57202882008": {"Name": "Lee J.H.", "AuthorID": "57202882008", "AffiliationID": "60002877", "AffiliationName": "UCL Eastman-Korea Dental Medicine Innovation Centre, Dankook University"}, "26643634100": {"Name": "Knowles J.C.", "AuthorID": "26643634100", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "57211729840": {"Name": "Kim H.W.", "AuthorID": "57211729840", "AffiliationID": "60002877", "AffiliationName": "UCL Eastman-Korea Dental Medicine Innovation Centre, Dankook University"}}}
