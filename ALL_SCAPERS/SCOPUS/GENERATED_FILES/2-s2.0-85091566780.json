In contrast, this article proposes a transparent and easily reproducible econometric methodology based on the Vector Error Correction model that uses aggregated and widely available data. The model is applied to the power generation sector in the United Kingdom using annual data from 1990 onwards and provides evidence that the long-term employment impact of renewable technologies is much higher than the impact arising from deploying nuclear or natural gas technologies. The impulse response function analysis indicates that a permanent 1 Gigawatt-hours increase in annual electricity supply generated by renewable technologies creates 3.5 jobs in the long-term period. Finally, this study derives the implications of the findings in the context of decarbonisation scenarios for the power sector in the United Kingdom and assesses the extent to which decarbonisation pathways based on renewable electricity contribute to stimulating employment in the generation sector.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cointegration", "Decarbonisation scenarios", "Electricity supply", "Employment effect", "Impulse responses", "Renewable electricity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Computable general equilibrium model", "Econometric methodologies", "Electricity supply", "Impulse response functions", "Natural Gas Technology", "Renewable electricity", "Renewable technology", "Vector error correction model"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091566780", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"]], "AuthorData": {"57196213763": {"Name": "Arvanitopoulos T.", "AuthorID": "57196213763", "AffiliationID": "60000112, 60122652", "AffiliationName": "Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, University of East Anglia"}, "15018959900": {"Name": "Agnolucci P.", "AuthorID": "15018959900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Sustainable Resources, University College London"}}}
