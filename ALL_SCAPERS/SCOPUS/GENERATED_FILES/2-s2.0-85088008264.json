The current clinical practice is to measure the diameter of the tumour in its largest dimension. It has been shown that volumetric measurement is more accurate and more reliable as a measure of VS size. The reference approach to achieve such volumetry is to manually segment the tumour, which is a time intensive task. We suggest that semi-automated segmentation may be a clinically applicable solution to this problem and that it could replace linear measurements as the clinical standard. Methods: Using high-quality software available for academic purposes, we ran a comparative study of manual versus semi-automated segmentation of VS on MRI with 5 clinicians and scientists. We gathered both quantitative and qualitative data to compare the two approaches; including segmentation time, segmentation effort and segmentation accuracy. Results: We found that the selected semi-automated segmentation approach is significantly faster (167 s vs 479 s, p< 0.001), less temporally and physically demanding and has approximately equal performance when compared with manual segmentation, with some improvements in accuracy. There were some limitations, including algorithmic unpredictability and error, which produced more frustration and increased mental effort in comparison with manual segmentation. Conclusion: We suggest that semi-automated segmentation could be applied clinically for volumetric measurement of VS on MRI. In future, the generic software could be refined for use specifically for VS segmentation, thereby improving accuracy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Imaging", "Machine learning", "Neuroimaging", "Segmentation", "Vestibular schwannoma"], "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Automation", "Contrast Media", "Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Machine Learning", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Neurilemmoma", "Neuroimaging", "Neuroma, Acoustic", "Pattern Recognition, Automated", "Reproducibility of Results", "Software"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088008264", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"57218140690": {"Name": "McGrath H.", "AuthorID": "57218140690", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "57218137670": {"Name": "Li P.", "AuthorID": "57218137670", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "57212001523": {"Name": "Dorent R.", "AuthorID": "57212001523", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "36983191400": {"Name": "Shapey J.", "AuthorID": "36983191400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences, UCL"}, "23010613000": {"Name": "Vercauteren T.", "AuthorID": "23010613000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "7103114022": {"Name": "Bradford R.", "AuthorID": "7103114022", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7102086722": {"Name": "Saeed S.", "AuthorID": "7102086722", "AffiliationID": "60029890", "AffiliationName": "The Royal National Throat Nose and Ear Hospital"}, "14627355000": {"Name": "Bisdas S.", "AuthorID": "14627355000", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Neuroradiology Department, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
