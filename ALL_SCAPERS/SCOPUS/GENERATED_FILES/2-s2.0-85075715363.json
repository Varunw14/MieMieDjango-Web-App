This paper investigates a novel extension to such systems by introducing a corrugated core between tensile timber and compressive concrete layers. This new \u2018HTCC\u2019 floor panel system is hypothesised to have an increased weight-specific flexural capacity relative to HTC systems, by reducing the volume of concrete below the panel neutral axis without decreasing flexural capacity. This paper experimentally investigates the flexural performance of the new system, acting in two configurations: with core orientation parallel to the span for maximum longitudinal one-way spanning capacity; and with core orientation transverse to the span for generation of a novel transverse spanning capacity. In total, eight HTCC floor panels were prepared and tested, with the flexural capacities and critical failure modes analysed for each. Effects of different core geometries, shear force transfer methods, and manifested composite action are also closely studied. Longitudinal specimens achieved the best composite action and correspondingly the highest panel performance, with a 73% ultimate moment carrying efficiency and an 85% stiffness efficiency at SLS, compared to an idealised HTC section with full composite action.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Composite structure", "GFRP-timber corrugated core", "Hybrid timber-concrete floor panel"], "IndexKeywords": ["Corrugated core", "Critical failures", "Experimental investigations", "Flexural capacity", "Flexural performance", "Shear force transfer", "Sustainable building", "Timber-concrete floors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075715363", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"]], "AuthorData": {"57210552245": {"Name": "Ou Y.", "AuthorID": "57210552245", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil Engineering, University of Queensland"}, "55915991800": {"Name": "Gattas J.", "AuthorID": "55915991800", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil Engineering, University of Queensland"}, "7005384599": {"Name": "Fernando D.", "AuthorID": "7005384599", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil Engineering, University of Queensland"}, "7004558676": {"Name": "Torero J.", "AuthorID": "7004558676", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
