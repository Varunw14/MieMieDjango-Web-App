In the 1970s, drawing on input-output models of economies and working with Philip Rees, Wilson established the accounting basis for Andrei Rogers' multi-regional projection model, adding international migration. Innovative methods were developed to complete demographic accounts, where there were data gaps. In the 2010s, working with Adam Dennett, Wilson systematized methods for estimating migration flows between regions in Europe, employing his family of spatial interaction models. The key aim of both research strands was to ensure that no information was ignored to ensure consistency in population and migration models. The influence of Wilson's contributions to research on population and migration is traced through a survey of subsequent research.", "AuthorKeywords": ["demographic accounts", "demographic projection models", "forecasting migration", "migration estimation", "models of urban and regional systems", "The work of Professor Sir Alan Wilson"], "IndexKeywords": ["demographic accounts", "Innovative method", "Input output model", "Migration flows", "Migration model", "Projection models", "Spatial interaction model", "The work of Professor Sir Alan Wilson"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075561561", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"], ["History and Philosophy of Science", "ARTS", "1207"]], "AuthorData": {"57203885444": {"Name": "Rees P.", "AuthorID": "57203885444", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, University of Leeds"}, "26030392400": {"Name": "Dennett A.", "AuthorID": "26030392400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College London"}}}
