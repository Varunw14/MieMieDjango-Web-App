We examine whether this stimulus can produce exercise-induced left ventricular (LV) trabeculation. Methods: Sixty-eight novice marathon runners aged 29.5 \u00b1 3.2 years had indices of LV trabeculation measured by echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging 6 months before and 2 weeks after the 2016 London Marathon race, in a prospective longitudinal study. Results: After 17 weeks unsupervised marathon training, indices of LV trabeculation were essentially unchanged. Despite satisfactory inter-observer agreement in most methods of trabeculation measurement, criteria defining abnormally hypertrabeculated cases were discordant with each other. LV hypertrabeculation was a frequent finding in young, healthy individuals with no subject demonstrating clear evidence of a cardiomyopathy. Conclusion: Training for a first marathon does not induce LV trabeculation. It remains unclear whether prolonged, high-dose exercise can create de novo trabeculation or expose concealed trabeculation. Applying cut off values from published LV noncompaction cardiomyopathy criteria to young, healthy individuals risks over-diagnosis.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085185639", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"56398021700": {"Name": "D'Silva A.", "AuthorID": "56398021700", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Clinical & Academic Group, St George's University of London"}, "7201833463": {"Name": "Malhotra A.", "AuthorID": "7201833463", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Clinical & Academic Group, St George's University of London"}, "35303631800": {"Name": "Sharma R.", "AuthorID": "35303631800", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Clinical & Academic Group, St George's University of London"}, "7405877896": {"Name": "Sharma S.", "AuthorID": "7405877896", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Clinical & Academic Group, St George's University of London"}, "6506837383": {"Name": "Captur G.", "AuthorID": "6506837383", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "34970790200": {"Name": "Bhuva A.N.", "AuthorID": "34970790200", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "55383197700": {"Name": "Jones S.", "AuthorID": "55383197700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "56528300800": {"Name": "Abdel-Gadir A.", "AuthorID": "56528300800", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "6504025861": {"Name": "Manisty C.", "AuthorID": "6504025861", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "57207789660": {"Name": "Hughes A.D.", "AuthorID": "57207789660", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "55645073800": {"Name": "Lloyd G.", "AuthorID": "55645073800", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "57202314649": {"Name": "Moon J.C.", "AuthorID": "57202314649", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "57190162808": {"Name": "van Zalen J.", "AuthorID": "57190162808", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "16030297600": {"Name": "Bastiaenen R.", "AuthorID": "16030297600", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"}, "13613670300": {"Name": "Gati S.", "AuthorID": "13613670300", "AffiliationID": "60027469", "AffiliationName": "East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust"}, "57194873095": {"Name": "Willis J.", "AuthorID": "57194873095", "AffiliationID": "60027647", "AffiliationName": "Royal United Hospitals Bath NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6507854704": {"Name": "Ster I.C.", "AuthorID": "6507854704", "AffiliationID": "60010426, 60029329", "AffiliationName": "Infection and Immunity Research Institute, St George's, University of London"}}}
