The authors built isotemporal substitution models to assess the theoretical effect of replacing sedentary behavior with an equal amount of light or moderate\u2013vigorous activity on frailty and mortality in community-based adults aged 50 years and older. Controlling for age, sex, body mass index, marital status, race, education, employment status, and National Health and Nutrition Examination Study cycle, replacing 1 hr of sedentary time with moderate\u2013vigorous or light physical activity daily was associated with a lower frailty index. For mortality, results varied based on frailty level. Replacing sedentary behavior with moderate\u2013vigorous exercise was associated with lower mortality risk in vulnerable individuals; however, replacing sedentary behavior with light activity was associated with lower mortality risk in frailer individuals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Exercise", "Frailty index", "Isotemporal substitution models"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083802810", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation", "HEAL", "3612"], ["Rehabilitation", "MEDI", "2742"], ["Gerontology", "NURS", "2909"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"55933028800": {"Name": "Godin J.", "AuthorID": "55933028800", "AffiliationID": "60015913", "AffiliationName": "Geriatric Medicine, Nova Scotia Health Authority, Dalhousie University"}, "57211788371": {"Name": "Rockwood K.", "AuthorID": "57211788371", "AffiliationID": "60015913", "AffiliationName": "Geriatric Medicine, Nova Scotia Health Authority, Dalhousie University"}, "23398558600": {"Name": "Theou O.", "AuthorID": "23398558600", "AffiliationID": "60015913", "AffiliationName": "Geriatric Medicine, Nova Scotia Health Authority, Dalhousie University"}, "56333770000": {"Name": "Blodgett J.M.", "AuthorID": "56333770000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, University College London"}}}
