For patients not responding or intolerant to medications, surgery is an option. Methods: In order to expand understanding of the pain-related burden of illness associated with TN, a cross-sectional survey was conducted of patients at a specialist center that utilizes a multidisciplinary care pathway. Participants provided information regarding their pain experience and treatment history, and completed several patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures. Results: Of 129 respondents, 69/128 (54%; 1 missing) reported no pain in the past 4 weeks. However, 84 (65%) respondents were on medications, including 49 (38%) on monotherapy and 35 (27%) on polytherapy. A proportion of patients had discontinued at least one medication in the past, mostly due to lack of efficacy (n = 62, 48%) and side effects (n = 51, 40%). A total of 52 (40%) patients had undergone surgery, of whom 30 had microvascular decompression (MVD). Although surgery, especially MVD, provided satisfactory pain control in many patients, 29% of post-surgical patients reported complications, 19% had pain worsen or stay the same, 48% were still taking pain medications for TN, and 33% reported new and different facial pain. Conclusions: In most PRO measures, respondents with current pain interference had poorer scores than those without pain interference. In the Patient Global Impression of Change, 79% expressed improvement since beginning of treatment at this clinic. These results indicate that while the multidisciplinary approach can substantially alleviate the impact of TN, there remains an unmet medical need for additional treatment options.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Facial pain", "Microvascular decompression", "Multidisciplinary approach", "Patient related outcomes", "Trigeminal nerve", "Trigeminal neuralgia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Cost of Illness", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "England", "Facial Pain", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Microvascular Decompression Surgery", "Middle Aged", "Pain Management", "Pain Measurement", "Postoperative Complications", "Treatment Outcome", "Trigeminal Neuralgia"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095684829", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"57190762353": {"Name": "O\u2019Callaghan L.", "AuthorID": "57190762353", "AffiliationID": "60029337", "AffiliationName": "Biogen"}, "42062468900": {"Name": "Vinikoor-Imler L.", "AuthorID": "42062468900", "AffiliationID": "60029337", "AffiliationName": "Biogen"}, "36096708100": {"Name": "Floden L.", "AuthorID": "36096708100", "AffiliationID": "115328525", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Outcomes Solutions"}, "57219839743": {"Name": "Hartford C.", "AuthorID": "57219839743", "AffiliationID": "115328525", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Outcomes Solutions"}, "6602566830": {"Name": "Symonds T.", "AuthorID": "6602566830", "AffiliationID": "118511153", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Outcomes Solutions, Unit 68"}, "55991821300": {"Name": "Giblin K.", "AuthorID": "55991821300", "AffiliationID": "60029337", "AffiliationName": "Formerly Biogen"}, "56810833400": {"Name": "Zakrzewska J.M.", "AuthorID": "56810833400", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCLH NHS Foundation Trust, Oral theme of the UCL/UCLH NIHR Biomedical Research Centre UK"}}}
