Methods: We investigated the frequency, predictors, consequences and therapeutic responses following cinacalcet-induced hypocalcemia in an incident European hemodialysis cohort of 1068 patients with a cinacalcet prescription. Results: Of 905 normocalcemic patients initiating cinacalcet, 67% developed hypocalcemia within 12 months: 68% mild, 23% moderate, 9% severe. Compared to persistently normocalcemic patients, those with severe hypocalcemia were more often diabetic, overweight, had cardiovascular disease, shorter dialysis vintage, used a catheter dialysis access, had fewer active vitamin-D sterols, and exhibited higher CRP and iPTH and lower calcium levels. Multivariate predictors of hypocalcemia included a catheter for vascular access, low albumin and high iPTH. Generally, no therapeutic intervention to prevent hypocalcemia was taken prior to cinacalcet initiation. After the hypocalcemic event, the most common clinical response was no change of the dialysis or medical regimen. Following the hypocalcemic event, iPTH remained low even in those with severe hypocalcemia. The number of deaths and cardiovascular events did not differ between patients with and without hypocalcemia within six months following cinacalcet initiation. Conclusion: Two-thirds of cinacalcet initiated patients experienced hypocalcaemia with 9% being severe. Hypocalcemia was mostly asymptomatic, transient (with and without targeted intervention to correct it) and not associated with an increase in cardiovascular events or deaths.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Calcimimetic", "Cinacalcet", "Hemodialysis", "Hypocalcemia", "Parathyroid hormone", "Secondary hyperparathyroidism"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076531278", "SubjectAreas": [["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"55961563700": {"Name": "Floege J.", "AuthorID": "55961563700", "AffiliationID": "60016653", "AffiliationName": "Division of Nephrology & Clinical Immunology, RWTH University of Aachen"}, "57204953572": {"Name": "Louie K.S.", "AuthorID": "57204953572", "AffiliationID": "60098775", "AffiliationName": "Amgen Ltd."}, "57189869694": {"Name": "Erhard C.", "AuthorID": "57189869694", "AffiliationID": "123658363", "AffiliationName": "Stanislas Limited"}, "57198363448": {"Name": "Wheeler D.C.", "AuthorID": "57198363448", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60104730", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, University College London, London UK and George Institute for Global Health"}, "7006825933": {"Name": "Stenvinkel P.", "AuthorID": "7006825933", "AffiliationID": "60019295, 60012311", "AffiliationName": "Division of Renal Medicine, Department of Clinical Science Technology and Intervention, Karolinska University Hospital, Karolinska Institute"}, "7004018516": {"Name": "Fouqueray B.", "AuthorID": "7004018516", "AffiliationID": "121995916", "AffiliationName": "Amgen GmbH"}}}
