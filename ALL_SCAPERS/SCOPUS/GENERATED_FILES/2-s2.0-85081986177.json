In this paper, we aim to jointly optimize the sampling resolution, i.e., the number of ADC bits, and analog/digital hybrid combiner matrices which provides highly energy efficient solutions for millimeter wave multiple-input multiple-output systems. A novel decomposition of the hybrid combiner to three parts is introduced: the analog combiner matrix, the bit resolution matrix and the baseband combiner matrix. The unknown matrices are computed as the solution to a matrix factorization problem where the optimal, fully digital combiner is approximated by the product of these matrices. An efficient solution based on the alternating direction method of multipliers is proposed to solve this problem. The simulation results show that the proposed solution achieves high EE performance when compared with existing benchmark techniques that use fixed ADC resolutions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Energy efficient design", "MmWave MIMO", "Optimal bit resolution and hybrid combining"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alternating direction method of multipliers", "Analog to digital converters", "Energy-efficient design", "Hybrid combining", "Matrix factorizations", "mm-Wave", "Multiple input multiple output system", "Sampling resolution"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081986177", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Information Systems and Management", "DECI", "1802"], ["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"], ["Media Technology", "ENGI", "2214"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"57192690147": {"Name": "Kaushik A.", "AuthorID": "57192690147", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Digital Communications, University of Edinburgh"}, "25028863300": {"Name": "Vlachos E.", "AuthorID": "25028863300", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Digital Communications, University of Edinburgh"}, "57203273091": {"Name": "Thompson J.", "AuthorID": "57203273091", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Digital Communications, University of Edinburgh"}, "35173643400": {"Name": "Tsinos C.", "AuthorID": "35173643400", "AffiliationID": "60072562", "AffiliationName": "Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust, University of Luxembourg"}}}
