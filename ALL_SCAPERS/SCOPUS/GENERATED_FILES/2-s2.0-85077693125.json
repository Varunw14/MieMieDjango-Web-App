Underlying mechanisms are not completely understood and no specific treatment exists. We investigated the role of nerve conduction studies (NCS) and of serum osteopontin (OPN) measurement as a means to stratify the risk of developing taxane-induced neuropathy (TIN). Methods: We enrolled 50 women with breast cancer treated with taxanes (docetaxel or paclitaxel) in a 3-month prospective study. They were evaluated before chemotherapy (time-point T0) and followed up at 1 (T1) and 3 (T2) months with clinical examinations/scales, quality of life (QoL) questionnaires, NCS, and serum OPN dosages. Results: A reduction of sural and superficial peroneal sensory action potentials was seen at T1, with a progression at T2 (P < 0.001). In contrast, a significant impact of neuropathic symptoms on QoL only occurred at T2 (P < 0.01). OPN levels at T0 inversely correlated to axonal loss in the sural nerve (T0\u2013T2, P < 0.01). OPN levels at T0 were lower in the intermediate and poor outcome patient subgroups, compared to the good outcome subgroup, as specifically defined (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Lower limb NCS changes occurred earlier than the detrimental effects of TIN on patients\u2019 QoL. Low serum OPN levels before chemotherapy may represent a novel biomarker of TIN risk.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Breast cancer", "Nerve conduction studies", "Osteopontin", "Polyneuropathy", "Taxanes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Breast Neoplasms", "Bridged-Ring Compounds", "Female", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Neural Conduction", "Osteopontin", "Peripheral Nervous System Diseases", "Prospective Studies", "Taxoids"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077693125", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"25959297400": {"Name": "Pizzamiglio C.", "AuthorID": "25959297400", "AffiliationID": "60003668", "AffiliationName": "Department of Translational Medicine, Section of Neurology, University of Piemonte-Orientale"}, "18635502800": {"Name": "Strigaro G.", "AuthorID": "18635502800", "AffiliationID": "115027816", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, \u201cMaggiore della Carit\u00e0\u201d University Hospital"}, "6701468226": {"Name": "Comi C.", "AuthorID": "6701468226", "AffiliationID": "60003668", "AffiliationName": "Department of Translational Medicine, Section of Neurology, University of Piemonte-Orientale"}, "14048037400": {"Name": "Cantello R.", "AuthorID": "14048037400", "AffiliationID": "115027816", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, \u201cMaggiore della Carit\u00e0\u201d University Hospital"}, "24336196100": {"Name": "Ripellino P.", "AuthorID": "24336196100", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Neurocenter of Southern-Switzerland"}, "55921637900": {"Name": "Prandi P.", "AuthorID": "55921637900", "AffiliationID": "115027816", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, \u201cMaggiore della Carit\u00e0\u201d University Hospital"}, "55142147800": {"Name": "Clemente N.", "AuthorID": "55142147800", "AffiliationID": "60003668", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of Piemonte-Orientale"}, "8259009800": {"Name": "Saggia C.", "AuthorID": "8259009800", "AffiliationID": "115027816", "AffiliationName": "Medical Oncology, \u201cMaggiore della Carit\u00e0\u201d University Hospital"}, "56800068400": {"Name": "Rossi V.", "AuthorID": "56800068400", "AffiliationID": "115027816", "AffiliationName": "Medical Oncology, \u201cMaggiore della Carit\u00e0\u201d University Hospital"}, "6602975477": {"Name": "Luigi Foglio Bonda P.", "AuthorID": "6602975477", "AffiliationID": "60003668", "AffiliationName": "Department of Translational Medicine, University of Piemonte Orientale"}}}
