Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimUnderstanding the influence of the mechanical environment on neurite behavior is crucial in the development of peripheral nerve repair solutions, and could help tissue engineers to direct and guide regeneration. In this study, a new protocol to fabricate physiologically relevant hydrogel substrates with controlled mechanical cues is proposed. These hydrogels allow the analysis of the relative effects of both the absolute stiffness value and the local stiffness gradient on neural cell behavior, particularly for low stiffness values (1\u20132 kPa). NG108-15 neural cell behavior is studied using well-characterized collagen gradient substrates with stiffness values ranging from 1 to 10 kPa and gradient slopes of either 0.84 or 7.9 kPa mm\u22121. It is found that cell orientation is influenced by specific combinations of stiffness value and stiffness gradient. The results highlight the importance of considering the type of hydrogel as well as both the absolute value of the stiffness and the steepness of its gradient, thus introducing a new framework for the development of tissue engineered scaffolds and the study of substrate stiffness.", "AuthorKeywords": ["mechanosensitivity", "neurites", "peripheral nervous system", "stiffness gradients"], "IndexKeywords": ["Mechanical environment", "Mechanical response", "Mechanosensitivity", "Neural-cell behavior", "Neurites", "Peripheral nerve repair", "Peripheral nervous system", "Tissue-engineered scaffolds"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076104713", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"57210260925": {"Name": "Kayal C.", "AuthorID": "57210260925", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nerve Engineering, University College London"}, "24554512000": {"Name": "Moeendarbary E.", "AuthorID": "24554512000", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "24921854100": {"Name": "Shipley R.J.", "AuthorID": "24921854100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nerve Engineering, University College London"}, "9240949100": {"Name": "Phillips J.B.", "AuthorID": "9240949100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nerve Engineering, University College London"}}}
