Here we present SonicSpray, a technique using ultrasonic Bessel beams to create reconfigurable mid-air displays. We build a prototype from low-cost, off-the-shelf parts. We explore the potential and limitations of SonicSpray to create and redirect laminar flows of fog. We demonstrate a working prototype that precisely controls laminar aerosols through only 6x6 ultrasound transducers array. We describe the implementation steps to build the device, verify the control and projection algorithm for the display, and evaluate its performance. We finally report our exploration of several useful applications, in learning, entertainment and arts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Permeable mid-air display", "Reconfigurable mid-air displays", "Ultrasonic control"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bessel beam", "Display quality", "Implementation steps", "Projection algorithms", "Reconfigurable", "Ultrasonic controls", "Ultrasound transducers", "Water mist"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076226236", "SubjectAreas": [["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"]], "AuthorData": {"57195642585": {"Name": "Norasikin M.A.", "AuthorID": "57195642585", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Informatics, University of Sussex"}, "57215517228": {"Name": "Plasencia D.M.", "AuthorID": "57215517228", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Informatics, University of Sussex"}, "55960652900": {"Name": "Memoli G.", "AuthorID": "55960652900", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Informatics, University of Sussex"}, "35389893300": {"Name": "Subramanian S.", "AuthorID": "35389893300", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Informatics, University of Sussex"}}}
