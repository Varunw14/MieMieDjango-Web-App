It enables the deposition of singularly adsorbed nanoparticles and prevents them from aggregating. In this work, polydopamine was grafted onto the internal surface of a Teflon AF-2400 tubular membrane, known for its excellent permeability to light gases and inertness to chemicals. Poly(acrylic acid) and poly(allylamine hydrochloride) were sequentially adsorbed onto the modified surface of the membrane. Ex situ synthesized spherical, cubical, truncated octahedral palladium or dendritic platinum-palladium nanoparticles were then incorporated. The catalytic membranes were assembled in a tube-in-tube configuration and tested over 6 h of continuous nitrobenzene hydrogenation with molecular hydrogen. Stable conversion was observed for the truncated octahedral and dendritic nanoparticles, while a progressive deactivation occurred for the other nanoparticles. Due to their small size, the 3.7 nm spherical nanoparticles exhibited the highest reaction rate, 629molreactant/(molcatalyst\u22c5h), while the cubical nanoparticles showed the highest turnover frequency, \u223c3000 h\u22121. The reactor concept developed in this work demonstrates how such a design can serve as a platform for conducting continuous multiphase catalytic reactions in flow using singularly adsorbed and finely tuned nanoparticles. The small volume of pressurized gas present in the tube-in-tube reactor offers improved process safety compared to a batch process, while the Teflon AF-2400 membrane provides control over the gas permeation during reaction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Colloidal nanoparticles", "Flow reactor", "Layer-by-layer assembly", "Palladium catalyst", "Polydopamine", "Tubular membrane"], "IndexKeywords": ["Layer-by-layer assemblies", "Nanoparticle adsorptions", "Nitrobenzene hydrogenation", "Palladium nanoparticles", "Polyallylamine hydrochloride", "Polyelectrolyte multilayer", "Spherical nanoparticles", "Unconventional approaches"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083793868", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"57193182782": {"Name": "Venezia B.", "AuthorID": "57193182782", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57193344313": {"Name": "Panariello L.", "AuthorID": "57193344313", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57216530067": {"Name": "Biri D.", "AuthorID": "57216530067", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57209100691": {"Name": "Damilos S.", "AuthorID": "57209100691", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56704654000": {"Name": "Radhakrishnan A.N.P.", "AuthorID": "56704654000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003522751": {"Name": "Gavriilidis A.", "AuthorID": "7003522751", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56959691700": {"Name": "Shin J.", "AuthorID": "56959691700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7005826606": {"Name": "Blackman C.", "AuthorID": "7005826606", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
