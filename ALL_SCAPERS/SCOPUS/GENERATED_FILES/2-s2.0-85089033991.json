Ultrathin diacetylene-linked COFs based on oxidized tetra-indole cores are narrow gap 2D semiconductors, featuring a pronounced anisotropic electronic band structure due to the combination of dispersive and flat band characteristics, while registering high room temperature charge carrier mobilities. The capability of bandgap and charge carrier localization tuning via the careful selection of fourfold porphyrin and porphyrinoid cores and twofold articulated linkers is demonstrated, with the majority of systems exhibiting electronic gap values between 1.75 eV and 2.3 eV. Tetra-indoles are also capable of forming stable monolayers via non-articulated core fusing, resulting in 2D morphologies with extended \u03c0-conjugation and semi-metallic behavior.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Carrier localization", "Covalent organic frameworks", "Diacetylenes", "Electronic band structure", "Electronic gap", "Metallic behaviors", "Organic electronics", "Pi conjugation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089033991", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"55578017900": {"Name": "Ziogos O.G.", "AuthorID": "55578017900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57218384504": {"Name": "Blanco I.", "AuthorID": "57218384504", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "8669973600": {"Name": "Blumberger J.", "AuthorID": "8669973600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
