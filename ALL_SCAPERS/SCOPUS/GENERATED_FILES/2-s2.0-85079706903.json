The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the current evidence of the use and implementation of AED TDM in patients with epilepsy and other non-epilepsy conditions. Areas covered: The pharmacokinetic variability of AEDs is extensive, resulting in pronounced variability in serum concentrations between patients. TDM may thus be useful to individualize the treatment of patients with epilepsy and also in non-epilepsy conditions. Indications for TDM include settings where pharmacokinetic variability is anticipated (e.g. in children, the elderly, during pregnancy, and patients prescribed polytherapy resulting in drug interactions) and drug adherence. TDM contributes to provide a quality assurance of the treatment. Patient management is, therefore, best guided by the determination of individual therapeutic concentrations. Expert opinion: Because of pharmacokinetic variability is prevalent among AEDs, TDM allows a bespoke approach to epilepsy care allowing dose adjustments based on measured drug concentrations so as to optimize clinical outcome. Future advances include the use of additional markers of toxicity and genetic variability so as to further aid individualization and optimize AED treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antiepileptic drugs", "drug interactions", "epilepsy", "pharmacokinetic variability", "therapeutic drug monitoring"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems", "Animals", "Anticonvulsants", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Drug Interactions", "Drug Monitoring", "Epilepsy", "Female", "Forecasting", "Humans", "Pharmacogenetics", "Pregnancy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079706903", "SubjectAreas": [["Toxicology", "PHAR", "3005"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"30967510300": {"Name": "Johannessen Landmark C.", "AuthorID": "30967510300", "AffiliationID": "60105037", "AffiliationName": "Section for Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Pharmacology, Oslo University Hospital"}, "7005455013": {"Name": "Johannessen S.I.", "AuthorID": "7005455013", "AffiliationID": "60105037", "AffiliationName": "Section for Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Pharmacology, Oslo University Hospital"}, "7005781451": {"Name": "Patsalos P.N.", "AuthorID": "7005781451", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical & Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}}}
