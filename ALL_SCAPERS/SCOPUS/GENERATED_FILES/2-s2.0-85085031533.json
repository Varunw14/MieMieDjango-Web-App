This provides an unprecedented opportunity for comparative and longitudinal studies of many functional aspects of the microbiome that go beyond taxonomic classification, such as profiling genetic determinants of antimicrobial resistance, interactions with the host, potentially clinically relevant functions, and the role of mobile genetic elements (MGEs). One of the most important but least studied of these aspects are the MGEs, collectively referred to as the 'mobilome'. Here we elaborate on the benefits and limitations of using different metagenomic protocols, discuss the relative merits of various sequencing technologies, and highlight relevant bioinformatics tools and pipelines to predict the presence of MGEs and their microbial hosts.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085031533", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"57214677092": {"Name": "Carr V.R.", "AuthorID": "57214677092", "AffiliationID": "60111768, 60100056", "AffiliationName": "The Alan Turing Institute, British Library"}, "35549372800": {"Name": "Moyes D.L.", "AuthorID": "35549372800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Host\u2013Microbiome Interactions, Faculty of Dentistry, Oral and Craniofacial Sciences, King's College London"}, "23991412900": {"Name": "Shkoporov A.", "AuthorID": "23991412900", "AffiliationID": "60005857, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "APC Microbiome Ireland, School of Microbiology, University College Cork"}, "7403558967": {"Name": "Hill C.", "AuthorID": "7403558967", "AffiliationID": "60005857, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "APC Microbiome Ireland, School of Microbiology, University College Cork"}, "7003643625": {"Name": "Mullany P.", "AuthorID": "7003643625", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013985", "AffiliationName": "Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}}}
