Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of new HCM diagnosis in SP mutation carriers. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of adult and pediatric SP mutation carriers identified during family screening who did not fulfill diagnostic criteria for HCM at first evaluation. Results: The authors evaluated 285 individuals from 156 families (median age 14.2 years [interquartile range: 6.8 to 31.6 years], 141 [49.5%] male individuals); 145 (50.9%) underwent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). Frequency of causal genes was as follows: MYBPC3 n = 123 (43.2%), MYH7 n = 69 (24.2%), TNNI3 n = 39 (13.7%), TNNT2 n = 34 (11.9%), TPM1 n = 9 (3.2%), MYL2 n = 6 (2.1%), ACTC1 n = 1 (0.4%), multiple mutations n = 4 (1.4%). Median follow-up was 8.0 years (interquartile range: 4.0 to 13.3 years) and 86 (30.2%) patients developed HCM; 16 of 50 (32.0%) fulfilled diagnostic criteria on CMR but not echocardiography. Estimated HCM penetrance at 15 years of follow-up was 46% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 38% to 54%). In a multivariable model adjusted for age and stratified for CMR, independent predictors of HCM development were male sex (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.91; 95% CI: 1.82 to 4.65) and abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) (HR: 4.02; 95% CI: 2.51 to 6.44); TNNI3 variants had the lowest risk (HR: 0.19; 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.55, compared to MYBPC3). Conclusions: Following a first negative screening, approximately 50% of SP mutation carriers develop HCM over 15 years of follow-up. Male sex and an abnormal ECG are associated with a higher risk of developing HCM. Regular CMR should be considered in long-term screening.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cardiac magnetic resonance", "ECG", "echocardiogram", "sex", "sudden cardiac death"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Cardiac Myosins", "Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic", "Child", "DNA", "DNA Mutational Analysis", "Echocardiography", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Genetic Testing", "Heterozygote", "Humans", "Male", "Mutation", "Pedigree", "Retrospective Studies", "Sarcomeres", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088269860", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"35620484900": {"Name": "Lorenzini M.", "AuthorID": "35620484900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Cardiovascular Science"}, "55327717900": {"Name": "Akhtar M.M.", "AuthorID": "55327717900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Cardiovascular Science"}, "9846194600": {"Name": "Lopes L.R.", "AuthorID": "9846194600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Cardiovascular Science"}, "57202356433": {"Name": "Elliott P.M.", "AuthorID": "57202356433", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Cardiovascular Science"}, "57194718986": {"Name": "Norrish G.", "AuthorID": "57194718986", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Inherited Cardiovascular Diseases, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "56324482500": {"Name": "Field E.", "AuthorID": "56324482500", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Inherited Cardiovascular Diseases, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "8892126000": {"Name": "Syrris P.", "AuthorID": "8892126000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Cardiovascular Science"}, "16204898600": {"Name": "Kaski J.P.", "AuthorID": "16204898600", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Inherited Cardiovascular Diseases, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7101787721": {"Name": "Ochoa J.P.", "AuthorID": "7101787721", "AffiliationID": "60023610", "AffiliationName": "Universidade da Coru\u00f1a, GRINCAR (Cardiovascular Research Group)"}, "57204570412": {"Name": "Cicerchia M.", "AuthorID": "57204570412", "AffiliationID": "60023610", "AffiliationName": "Universidade da Coru\u00f1a, GRINCAR (Cardiovascular Research Group)"}}}
