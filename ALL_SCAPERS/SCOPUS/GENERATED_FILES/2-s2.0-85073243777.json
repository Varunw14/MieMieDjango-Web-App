We suggest that the rationale for such a preventive approach is directly informed by the emerging findings from the field of functional neuroimaging. Here, we review the evidence from four neurocognitive systems: threat processing, reward processing, emotion regulation and executive control. We briefly summarise what is known about each system, review the evidence that altered functioning is implicated in common mental health problems and describe how the functioning of each system is altered following maltreatment. Across domains, these neurocognitive alterations following child maltreatment are in line with those seen in adults presenting with mental health problems yet most maltreated children studied do not have a presenting \u2018disorder\u2019. This suggests that these neurocognitive alterations may potentiate the risk of future psychopathology. We discuss this possibility in the context of the theory of latent vulnerability (McCrory and Viding, 2015). According to this model, children may respond to early adverse environments in ways that are potentially adaptive in the short term but which create vulnerability to future mental health problems in the long term. We also consider the clinical implications of the neuroimaging evidence \u2012 in particular, the growing need for a more preventive clinical approach.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Child abuse", "functional magnetic resonance imaging", "maltreatment", "mental health", "resilience"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073243777", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"57190135417": {"Name": "Gerin M.I.", "AuthorID": "57190135417", "AffiliationID": "60170329", "AffiliationName": "Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}, "6602910723": {"Name": "McCrory E.J.", "AuthorID": "6602910723", "AffiliationID": "60170329", "AffiliationName": "Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}, "57195564227": {"Name": "Hanson E.", "AuthorID": "57195564227", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "23091807800": {"Name": "Viding E.", "AuthorID": "23091807800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
