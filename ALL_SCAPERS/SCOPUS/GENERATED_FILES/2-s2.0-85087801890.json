The neural correlates of anosognosia within AD remain inconclusive. Understanding anosognosia is of importance because of its impact on carer burden and increased institutionalization. A systematic review of structural and functional neuroimaging studies was conducted to identify specific brain regions associated with anosognosia within AD. Thirty-two studies were included in the systematic review. Reduced gray matter density, cerebral blood flow, and hypometabolism in 8 key regions were significantly associated with increased anosognosia scores in people with AD. The most frequently associated regions were the inferior frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex, and medial temporal lobe. Other key regions include the superior frontal gyrus, medial frontal gyrus, orbitofrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and the insula. Identifying brain regions associated with anosognosia can aid understanding and identification of anosognosia in people with AD and potentially facilitate improvements in care.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Anosognosia", "Neural-correlates", "Neuroimaging", "Systematic review"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087801890", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"57203949450": {"Name": "Hallam B.", "AuthorID": "57203949450", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "57214724389": {"Name": "Chan J.", "AuthorID": "57214724389", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "57217985878": {"Name": "Gonzalez Costafreda S.", "AuthorID": "57217985878", "AffiliationID": "60161451", "AffiliationName": "Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust"}, "49361119500": {"Name": "Bhome R.", "AuthorID": "49361119500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "37012043900": {"Name": "Huntley J.", "AuthorID": "37012043900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}}}
