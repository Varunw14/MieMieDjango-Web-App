The application of BIM is not as straightforward as it sounds though, with numerous software solutions available, various implementation processes across the project lifecycle, which challenges the interoperability and how information flows throughout the various project stages. This paper performs and presents a systematic review of the BIM software landscape currently available for the construction industry across the various project phases and in alignment with the 2013 RIBA Plan of Works. A gap analysis is conducted among these BIM solutions to examine the different software application areas, software architecture, interoperability possibilities, accessibility and affordability, by applying descriptive statistics. Surprisingly, the BIM software ecosystem is fragmented across the different project stages and highly proprietary and further hindered by the large number of specialised and highly sophisticated solutions addressed to advanced computer users. To this end, the paper aims to inform the industry\u2019s stakeholders, policy makers and software vendors, while shedding light on the extent that sophisticated BIM solutions can be disseminated to the market.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Building Information Modelling (BIM)", "Digital twin", "Interoperability", "Lifecycle", "Software"], "IndexKeywords": ["Building Information Modelling", "Descriptive statistics", "Implementation process", "Information flows", "Project lifecycle", "Software applications", "Software ecosystems", "Software solution"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079318227", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Information Systems and Management", "DECI", "1802"], ["Architecture", "ENGI", "2216"]], "AuthorData": {"56367767700": {"Name": "Papadonikolaki E.", "AuthorID": "56367767700", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London"}, "55855352600": {"Name": "Leon M.", "AuthorID": "55855352600", "AffiliationID": "60011885", "AffiliationName": "Scott Sutherland School of Architecture and the Built Environment, Robert Gordon University"}, "56084000400": {"Name": "Mahamadu A.M.", "AuthorID": "56084000400", "AffiliationID": "60019611", "AffiliationName": "Department of Architecture and the Built Environment, University of the West of England"}}}
