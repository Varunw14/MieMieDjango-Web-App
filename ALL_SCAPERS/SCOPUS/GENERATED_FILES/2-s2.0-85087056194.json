Aim: To elicit public preferences for FIT versus colonoscopy (CC) and its delivery in primary care. Design & setting: A cross-sectional online survey in England. Method: A total of 1057 adults (without CRC symptoms and diagnosis) aged 40-59 years were invited from an English online survey panel. Responders were asked to imagine they had been experiencing CRC symptoms that would qualify them for a diagnostic test. Participants were presented with choices between CC and FIT in ascending order of number of CRCs missed by FIT (from 1-10%). It was measured at what number of missed CRCs responders preferred CC over FIT. Results: While 150 participants did not want either of the tests when both missed 1% CRCs, the majority (n = 741, 70.0%) preferred FIT to CC at that level of accuracy. However, this preference reduced to 427 (40.4%) when FIT missed one additional cancer. Women were more likely to tolerate missing CRC when using FIT. Having lower numeracy and perceiving a higher level of risk meant participants were less likely to tolerate a false negative test. Most of those who chose FIT preferred to return it by mail (62.2%), to be informed about normal test results by letter (42.1%), and about abnormal test results face to face (32.5%). Conclusion: While the majority of participants preferred FIT over CC when both tests had the same sensitivity, tolerance for missed CRCs was low.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Choice experiment", "Colorectal neoplasms", "Diagnostic tests", "Preference elicitation", "Primary health care", "Surveys and questionnaires"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087056194", "SubjectAreas": [["Family Practice", "MEDI", "2714"]], "AuthorData": {"23029251000": {"Name": "von Wagner C.", "AuthorID": "23029251000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "57205182933": {"Name": "Verstraete W.", "AuthorID": "57205182933", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "57073831200": {"Name": "Hirst Y.", "AuthorID": "57073831200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "56108796900": {"Name": "Nicholson B.D.", "AuthorID": "56108796900", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Dept Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "56136479100": {"Name": "Stoffel S.T.", "AuthorID": "56136479100", "AffiliationID": "60023588", "AffiliationName": "European Center of Pharmaceutical Medicine, University of Basel"}, "55513725400": {"Name": "Laszlo H.", "AuthorID": "55513725400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "UCLH Cancer Collaborative, University College London Hospitals"}}}
