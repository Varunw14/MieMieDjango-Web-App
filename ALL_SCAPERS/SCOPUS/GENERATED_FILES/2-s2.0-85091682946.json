A subset of NPH patients respond only temporarily to shunt insertion despite low valve opening pressure. This study aims to describe our experience of patients who benefit from further CSF drainage by adding adjustable antigravity valves and draining CSF at ultra-low pressure. Methods: Single-centre retrospective case series of patients undergoing shunt valve revision from an adjustable differential pressure valve with fixed antigravity unit to a system incorporating an adjustable gravitational valve (Miethke proSA). Patients were screened from a database of NPH patients undergoing CSF diversion over 10 consecutive years (April 2008\u2013April 2018). Clinical records were retrospectively reviewed for interventions and clinical outcomes. Results: Nineteen (10F:9M) patients underwent elective VP shunt revision to a system incorporating an adjustable gravitational valve. Mean age 77.1 \u00b1 7.1 years (mean \u00b1 SD). Eleven patients (58%) showed significant improvement in walking speed following shunt revision. Fourteen patients/carers (74%) reported subjective improvements in symptoms following shunt revision. Conclusions: Patients presenting symptoms relapse following VP shunting may represent a group of patients with ultra-low-pressure hydrocephalus, for whom further CSF drainage may lead to an improvement in symptoms. These cases may benefit from shunt revision with an adjustable gravitational valve, adjustment of which can lead to controlled siphoning of CSF and drain CSF despite ultra-low CSF pressure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cerebrospinal fluid", "Gravitational valve", "Low-pressure hydrocephalus", "Normal-pressure hydrocephalus", "Shunt revision", "Ventriculoperitoneal shunt"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091682946", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57201152828": {"Name": "Funnell J.P.", "AuthorID": "57201152828", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "UCL Medical School"}, "57202961084": {"Name": "D\u2019Antona L.", "AuthorID": "57202961084", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "56419604800": {"Name": "Craven C.L.", "AuthorID": "56419604800", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7005963244": {"Name": "Thorne L.", "AuthorID": "7005963244", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7102438957": {"Name": "Watkins L.D.", "AuthorID": "7102438957", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "22958811100": {"Name": "Toma A.K.", "AuthorID": "22958811100", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}}}
