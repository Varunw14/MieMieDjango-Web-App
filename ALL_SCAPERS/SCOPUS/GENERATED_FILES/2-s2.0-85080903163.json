A taxonomy of clinical research descriptions is explained with reference to medical imaging examples. Because many descriptive terms have precise methodological implications, it is important that these terms are understood by readers and used correctly by researchers, so that the reader is not misled. Key Points: \u2022 Multiple different terms are being used to describe radiological research \u201cstudies\u201d and \u201ctrials\u201d, and many of these terms have precise methodological implications. \u2022 Radiological researchers sometimes use titles that describe their research incorrectly. This can mislead the reader as to what was actually done. \u2022 It is important that readers and researchers understand the correct taxonomy of clinical research and that researchers adopt the correct description for their work.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clinical study", "Clinical trial", "Feasibility studies", "Observational study", "Pilot study"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomedical Research", "Humans", "Radiology", "Research Design", "Societies, Medical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85080903163", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"55642708000": {"Name": "Halligan S.", "AuthorID": "55642708000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London UCL"}, "57212490056": {"Name": "Kenis S.F.", "AuthorID": "57212490056", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London UCL"}, "6504351732": {"Name": "Abeyakoon O.", "AuthorID": "6504351732", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London UCL"}, "14834275900": {"Name": "Plumb A.A.O.", "AuthorID": "14834275900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London UCL"}, "57189234864": {"Name": "Mallett S.", "AuthorID": "57189234864", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Health Sciences, University of Birmingham"}}}
