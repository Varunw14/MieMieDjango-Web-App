Targeting the processes involved in dietary phosphate absorption is an attractive means for reducing this phosphate burden. We do not, however, fully understand this process and how it is regulated. This commentary describes recent findings regarding the novel role of bile acids in regulating paracellular phosphate (and calcium) absorption by the small intestine and the potential cellular mechanisms involved.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084391047", "SubjectAreas": [["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"12768317600": {"Name": "Marks J.", "AuthorID": "12768317600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}}}
