HE manifests as a wide spectrum of neuropsychiatric abnormalities, from subclinical changes (mild cognitive impairment) to marked disorientation, confusion and coma. The clinical and economic burden of HE is considerable, and it contributes greatly to impaired quality of life, morbidity and mortality. This review will critically discuss the latest classification of HE, as well as the pathogenesis and pathophysiological pathways underlying the neurological decline in patients with end-stage liver disease. In addition, management strategies, diagnostic approaches, currently available therapeutic options and novel treatment strategies are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ammonia", "Diagnosis", "Hepatic encephalopathy", "Management", "Pathogenesis", "Pathophysiology", "Treatments"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85093666436", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"]], "AuthorData": {"57203057532": {"Name": "Rose C.F.", "AuthorID": "57203057532", "AffiliationID": "60009657, 60009507", "AffiliationName": "Hepato-Neuro Laboratory, CRCHUM, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"}, "36146600100": {"Name": "Amodio P.", "AuthorID": "36146600100", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Padova"}, "8778703700": {"Name": "Montagnese S.", "AuthorID": "8778703700", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Padova"}, "23569203200": {"Name": "Bajaj J.S.", "AuthorID": "23569203200", "AffiliationID": "60014232, 60002476", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Virginia Commonwealth University and McGuire VA Medical Center"}, "35600375300": {"Name": "Dhiman R.K.", "AuthorID": "35600375300", "AffiliationID": "60000137", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research"}, "7006906505": {"Name": "Taylor-Robinson S.D.", "AuthorID": "7006906505", "AffiliationID": "60022871, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Cancer, St. Mary's Hospital Campus, Imperial College London"}, "7004936517": {"Name": "Vilstrup H.", "AuthorID": "7004936517", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatology and Gastroenterology, Aarhus University Hospital"}, "57211739627": {"Name": "Jalan R.", "AuthorID": "57211739627", "AffiliationID": "117529400", "AffiliationName": "European Foundation for the Study of Chronic Liver Failure"}}}
