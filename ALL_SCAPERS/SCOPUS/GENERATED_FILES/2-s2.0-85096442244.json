By linking a quasi-experimental design with detailed financial information, we analyse the cost-effectiveness of the Campaign for Female Education (CAMFED)\u2019s programme in Tanzania. The programme provides targeted, multi-dimensional support to marginalised girls in government secondary schools in deprived rural areas. We find the cost-effectiveness of CAMFED\u2019s programme to be similar to interventions designed for more advantaged populations who are easier (and less costly) to reach. There is further evidence of positive spill-over effects to boys in the schools supported by CAMFED.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cost effectiveness", "equity", "Girls\u2019 Education", "Tanzania"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096442244", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Development", "SOCI", "3303"]], "AuthorData": {"13103713600": {"Name": "Sabates R.", "AuthorID": "13103713600", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Education, University of Cambridge"}, "9432808500": {"Name": "Rose P.", "AuthorID": "9432808500", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Education, University of Cambridge"}, "56671288100": {"Name": "Alcott B.", "AuthorID": "56671288100", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}, "34976386600": {"Name": "Delprato M.", "AuthorID": "34976386600", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, University of Sussex"}}}
