Animals such as goats show impressive ability to resist slippage on cliffs. It is not fully known what attributes in their body determine this ability. Studying the slip resistance dynamics of the goat may offer insight toward the biologically inspired design of robotic hooves. This article tests how the embodiment of the hoof contributes to solving the problem of slip resistance. We ran numerical simulations and experiments using a passive robotic goat hoof for different compliance levels of its three joints. We established that compliant yaw and pitch and stiff roll can increase the energy required to slide the hoof by \u224820% compared to the baseline (stiff hoof). Compliant roll and pitch allow the robotic hoof to adapt to the irregularities of the terrain. This produces an antilock braking system-like behavior of the robotic hoof for slip resistance. Therefore, the pastern and coffin joints have a substantial effect on the slip resistance of the robotic hoof, while the fetlock joint has the lowest contribution. These shed insights into how robotic hooves can be used to autonomously improve slip resistance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biologically inspired robots", "compliant joint/mechanism", "legged robots", "slip resistance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biologically inspired design", "Biologically-inspired robots", "Compliant joints", "Dynamic slips", "Legged locomotion", "Legged robots", "Robust mechanisms", "Slip resistance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076388170", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57192428863": {"Name": "Abad S.", "AuthorID": "57192428863", "AffiliationID": "120780043", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Applied Sustainability Research"}, "56647960500": {"Name": "Herzig N.", "AuthorID": "56647960500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Dyson School of Design Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "6508336274": {"Name": "Nanayakkara T.", "AuthorID": "6508336274", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Dyson School of Design Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "57188663416": {"Name": "Sadati S.", "AuthorID": "57188663416", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Mathematics, University of Bristol"}}}
