To overcome this limitation, self-supervised learning has emerged as a promising alternative for training models to perform monocular depth estimation. In this paper, we propose a set of improvements, which together result in both quantitatively and qualitatively improved depth maps compared to competing self-supervised methods. Research on self-supervised monocular training usually explores increasingly complex architectures, loss functions, and image formation models, all of which have recently helped to close the gap with fully-supervised methods. We show that a surprisingly simple model, and associated design choices, lead to superior predictions. In particular, we propose (i) a minimum reprojection loss, designed to robustly handle occlusions, (ii) a full-resolution multi-scale sampling method that reduces visual artifacts, and (iii) an auto-masking loss to ignore training pixels that violate camera motion assumptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in isolation, and show high quality, state-of-the-art results on the KITTI benchmark.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Complex architectures", "Depth Estimation", "Full resolutions", "Image formation models", "Simple modeling", "State of the art", "Supervised methods", "Visual artifacts"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081918599", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"]], "AuthorData": {"57188567977": {"Name": "Godard C.", "AuthorID": "57188567977", "AffiliationID": "124987786", "AffiliationName": "UCL"}, "15135206900": {"Name": "Brostow G.", "AuthorID": "15135206900", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Niantic"}, "35177072300": {"Name": "Aodha O.M.", "AuthorID": "35177072300", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "Caltech"}, "6602655015": {"Name": "Firman M.", "AuthorID": "6602655015", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Niantic"}}}
