Movement Disorders published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of International Parkinson and Movement Disorder SocietyBackground: Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) is a widely used treatment for Parkinson\u02bcs disease (PD) patients with motor complications, but can result in adverse effects (AEs) in a significant proportion of treated patients. The use of novel programming features including short pulse width (PW) and directional steering in alleviating stimulation-induced AEs has not been explored. Objective: To determine if programming with short PW, directional steering, or the combination of these novel techniques can improve stimulation-induced dysarthria, dyskinesia, and pyramidal AEs. Methods: Thirty-two consecutive PD patients who experienced reversible AEs of STN-DBS had optimization of their settings using either short PW, directional steering, or the combination, while ensuring equivalent control of motor symptoms. Pairwise comparisons of pre- and post-optimization adverse effect ratings were made. Patients were left on the alternative setting with the greatest benefit and followed up at 6 months. Modeling of volume of tissue activated (VTA) and charge per pulse (Qp) calculations were used to explore potential underlying mechanisms of any differences found. Results: There were significant improvements in stimulation-induced dysarthria, dyskinesia, and pyramidal side effects after optimization. At 6 months, mean AE ratings remained significantly improved compared to pre-optimization ratings. Different patterns of shift in VTA for each AE, and Qp could be used to explain improvements using novel techniques. Conclusions: Stimulation-induced dysarthria, dyskinesia, and pyramidal AEs induced by STN-DBS can be improved by using novel programming techniques. These represent additional tools to conventional methods that can be used to address these AEs. \u00a9 2020 The Authors.
