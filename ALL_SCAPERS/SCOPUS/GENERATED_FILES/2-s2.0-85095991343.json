This review seeks to assess the current integrated clinical pathway for obesity management in England and determine the major challenges. Recent Findings: Evidence for tier 2 (community-based lifestyle intervention) and tier 3 (specialist weight management services) is limited, and how it facilitates care and improve outcomes in tier 4 remains uncertain. Treatment access, rigidity in pathways, uncertain treatment outcomes and weight stigma seems to be major barriers to improved care. Summary: More emphasis must be placed on access to effective treatments, treatment flexibility, addressing stigma and ensuring treatment efficacy including long-term health outcomes. Prevention and treatment should both receive significant focus though should be considered to be largely separate pathways. A simplified system for weight management is needed to allow flexibility and the delivery of personalized care including post-bariatric surgery care for those who need it.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clinical pathways", "Integrated pathway", "Medical management", "NHS", "Obesity", "Obesity management", "Tier 2", "Tier 3", "Tier 4", "Weight management"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095991343", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55808471100": {"Name": "Hazlehurst J.M.", "AuthorID": "55808471100", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diabetes and Endocrinology, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57197781471": {"Name": "Abbott S.", "AuthorID": "57197781471", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bariatric Surgery, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55885949100": {"Name": "Tahrani A.A.", "AuthorID": "55885949100", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diabetes and Endocrinology, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24070828800": {"Name": "Logue J.", "AuthorID": "24070828800", "AffiliationID": "60117765, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "Lancaster Medical School, Lancaster University"}, "35273364200": {"Name": "Parretti H.M.", "AuthorID": "35273364200", "AffiliationID": "60117932, 60000112", "AffiliationName": "Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia"}, "57209807171": {"Name": "Brown A.", "AuthorID": "57209807171", "AffiliationID": "60172638, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Health Research, UCLH Biomedical Research Centre"}, "26641323700": {"Name": "Pournaras D.J.", "AuthorID": "26641323700", "AffiliationID": "60016447", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Weight Management and Bariatric Service, Southmead Hospital"}}}
