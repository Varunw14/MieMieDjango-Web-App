International Journal of Laboratory Hematology published by John Wiley & Sons LtdThis guidance document was prepared on behalf of the International Council for Standardization in Haematology (ICSH), by the ADAMTS13 Assay Working Group, which comprises an international group of both clinical and laboratory experts. The document provides recommendations on best practice for the performance of ADAMTS13 assays in clinical laboratories. ADAMTS13 assays support the differential diagnosis of thrombotic microangiopathies and have utility in the management of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). There are three types of assay: activity, antigen and autoantibody/inhibitor assays. Methods for activity assays differ in terms of sensitivity, specificity, precision and turnaround time. The most widely used assays involve VWF peptide substrates and either chromogenic ELISA or FRET techniques, although chemiluminescence assays and rapid screening tests have recently become available. Tests for autoantibodies and inhibitors allow confirmation of acquired, immune-mediated TTP, while antigen assays may be useful in congenital TTP and as prognostic markers. In this document, we have attempted to describe ADAMTS13 assays and the conditions that affect them, as well as: blood collection, sample processing, quality control, standardization and clinical utility; recognizing that laboratories in different parts of the world have varying levels of sophistication. The recommendations are based on expert opinion, published literature and good clinical laboratory practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ADAMTS13", "haemostasis", "thrombosis", "VWF"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088121180", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Biochemistry (medical)", "MEDI", "2704"]], "AuthorData": {"7101821252": {"Name": "Mackie I.", "AuthorID": "7101821252", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Haematology, University College London"}, "7102377527": {"Name": "Machin S.", "AuthorID": "7102377527", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Haematology, University College London"}, "37026521300": {"Name": "Mancini I.", "AuthorID": "37026521300", "AffiliationID": "60030318, 60007067", "AffiliationName": "Fondazione IRCCS Ca\u2019 Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Angelo Bianchi Bonomi Hemophilia and Thrombosis Center, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano, Department of Pathophysiology and Transplantation and Fo, ndazione Luigi Villa"}, "55822477700": {"Name": "Muia J.", "AuthorID": "55822477700", "AffiliationID": "60025022", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences"}, "6602116940": {"Name": "Kremer Hovinga J.", "AuthorID": "6602116940", "AffiliationID": "60010987", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hematology and Central Hematology Laboratory, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital"}, "9734855100": {"Name": "Nair S.", "AuthorID": "9734855100", "AffiliationID": "60000653", "AffiliationName": "Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology, Christian Medical College"}, "7404218690": {"Name": "Baker R.", "AuthorID": "7404218690", "AffiliationID": "60019939", "AffiliationName": "Western Australia Centre for Thrombosis and Haemostasis, Perth Blood Institute, Murdoch University"}}}
