Methods: Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for studies published up to October 2018 on the diagnostic accuracy of DCE-CT for the characterisation of pulmonary nodules. For the index test, studies with a minimum of a pre- and post-contrast computed tomography scan were evaluated. Studies with a reference standard of biopsy for malignancy, and biopsy or 2-year follow-up for benign disease were included. Study bias was assessed using QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies). The sensitivities, specificities, and diagnostic odds ratios were determined along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a bivariate random effects model. Results: Twenty-three studies were included, including 2397 study participants with 2514 nodules of which 55.3% were malignant (1389/2514). The pooled accuracy results were sensitivity 94.8% (95% CI 91.5; 96.9), specificity 75.5% (69.4; 80.6), and diagnostic odds ratio 56.6 (24.2\u201388.9). QUADAS 2 assessment showed intermediate/high risk of bias in a large proportion of the studies (52\u201378% across the domains). No difference was present in sensitivity or specificity between subgroups when studies were split based on CT technique, sample size, nodule size, or publication date. Conclusion: DCE-CT has a high diagnostic accuracy for the diagnosis of pulmonary nodules although study quality was indeterminate in a large number of cases. Key Points: \u2022 The pooled accuracy results were sensitivity 95.1% and specificity 73.8% although individual studies showed wide ranges of values. \u2022 This is comparable to the results of previous meta-analyses of PET/CT (positron emission tomography/computed tomography) diagnostic accuracy for the diagnosis of solitary pulmonary nodules. \u2022 Robust direct comparative accuracy and cost-effectiveness studies are warranted to determine the optimal use of DCE-CT and PET/CT in the diagnosis of SPNs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Contrast media", "Lung cancer", "Meta-analysis", "Multi-detector computed tomography", "Solitary pulmonary nodule"], "IndexKeywords": ["Fluorodeoxyglucose F18", "Humans", "Lung Neoplasms", "Multiple Pulmonary Nodules", "Radiopharmaceuticals", "Solitary Pulmonary Nodule", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079483272", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"50862327600": {"Name": "Weir-McCall J.R.", "AuthorID": "50862327600", "AffiliationID": "60025649", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine"}, "57217207822": {"Name": "Joyce S.", "AuthorID": "57217207822", "AffiliationID": "60025649", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine"}, "56190357800": {"Name": "MacKay J.W.", "AuthorID": "56190357800", "AffiliationID": "60025649", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine"}, "57209113108": {"Name": "Baxter G.", "AuthorID": "57209113108", "AffiliationID": "60025649", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine"}, "7101783384": {"Name": "Gilbert F.J.", "AuthorID": "7101783384", "AffiliationID": "60025649", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine"}, "57203922102": {"Name": "Clegg A.", "AuthorID": "57203922102", "AffiliationID": "60031259", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Health and Wellbeing, University of Central Lancashire"}, "37360955700": {"Name": "Dendl L.M.", "AuthorID": "37360955700", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospital"}, "6602134551": {"Name": "Rintoul R.C.", "AuthorID": "6602134551", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, University of Cambridge"}, "7103016459": {"Name": "Qureshi N.R.", "AuthorID": "7103016459", "AffiliationID": "60033313", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Royal Papworth Hospital"}, "16948025200": {"Name": "Miles K.", "AuthorID": "16948025200", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}}}
