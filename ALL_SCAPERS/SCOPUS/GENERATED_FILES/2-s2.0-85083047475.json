Controlled nucleation techniques have been developed to address this problem; these make it possible to trigger the formation of ice crystals at the same time and temperature in all the batch. Here, the controlled nucleation technique known as vacuum induced surface freezing is compared to spontaneous freezing for the freeze drying of human plasma, a highly concentrated system commonly stored in a dried state. The potency of Factor VIII (FVIII), a sensitive, labile protein present in plasma, and the reconstitution time of the dried cakes are evaluated immediately after freeze drying, and after 1, 3, 6 or 9 months storage at different degradation temperatures. We show that the application of controlled nucleation significantly reduces the reconstitution time and in addition helps to improve FVIII stability.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biological activity", "Controlled nucleation", "Freeze drying", "Plasma"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083047475", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"57195588633": {"Name": "Arsiccio A.", "AuthorID": "57195588633", "AffiliationID": "60012162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Science and Technology, Politecnico di Torino"}, "56107552300": {"Name": "Pisano R.", "AuthorID": "56107552300", "AffiliationID": "60012162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Science and Technology, Politecnico di Torino"}, "6602448229": {"Name": "Matejtschuk P.", "AuthorID": "6602448229", "AffiliationID": "60000365", "AffiliationName": "Standardisation Science, National Institute for Biological Standards & Control (NIBSC)"}, "57216298024": {"Name": "Ezeajughi E.", "AuthorID": "57216298024", "AffiliationID": "60000365", "AffiliationName": "Standardisation Science, National Institute for Biological Standards & Control (NIBSC)"}, "7203038451": {"Name": "Malik K.", "AuthorID": "7203038451", "AffiliationID": "60000365", "AffiliationName": "Standardisation Science, National Institute for Biological Standards & Control (NIBSC)"}, "57216296832": {"Name": "Riches-Duit A.", "AuthorID": "57216296832", "AffiliationID": "60000365", "AffiliationName": "Biotherapeutics Division, National Institute for Biological Standards & Control (NIBSC)"}, "57214985589": {"Name": "Raut S.", "AuthorID": "57214985589", "AffiliationID": "60000365", "AffiliationName": "Biotherapeutics Division, National Institute for Biological Standards & Control (NIBSC)"}, "56278053600": {"Name": "Bullen A.", "AuthorID": "56278053600", "AffiliationID": "60011326", "AffiliationName": "UCL Ear Institute"}}}
