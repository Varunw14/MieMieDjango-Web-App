These rapid responses leverage billions of mobile phones, large online datasets, connected devices, relatively low-cost computing resources and advances in machine learning and natural language processing. This Review aims to capture the breadth of digital innovations for the public-health response to COVID-19 worldwide and their limitations, and barriers to their implementation, including legal, ethical and privacy barriers, as well as organizational and workforce barriers. The future of public health is likely to become increasingly digital, and we review the need for the alignment of international strategies for the regulation, evaluation and use of digital technologies to strengthen pandemic management, and future preparedness for COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Betacoronavirus", "Coronavirus Infections", "Humans", "Machine Learning", "Natural Language Processing", "Pandemics", "Pneumonia, Viral", "Population Surveillance", "Privacy", "Public Health"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089188396", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"57207206009": {"Name": "Budd J.", "AuthorID": "57207206009", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "57195275473": {"Name": "Miller B.S.", "AuthorID": "57195275473", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "57218440420": {"Name": "Manning E.M.", "AuthorID": "57218440420", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "7006090296": {"Name": "McKendry R.A.", "AuthorID": "7006090296", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "36610455100": {"Name": "Lampos V.", "AuthorID": "36610455100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7101864930": {"Name": "Cox I.J.", "AuthorID": "7101864930", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen"}, "57218440224": {"Name": "Zhuang M.", "AuthorID": "57218440224", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College London"}, "24485298800": {"Name": "Edelstein M.", "AuthorID": "24485298800", "AffiliationID": "60020875", "AffiliationName": "Centre on Global Security, Chatham House"}, "7202374409": {"Name": "Rees G.", "AuthorID": "7202374409", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Life Sciences, University College London"}, "7102404974": {"Name": "Emery V.C.", "AuthorID": "7102404974", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbial Sciences, University of Surrey"}, "7402243195": {"Name": "Stevens M.M.", "AuthorID": "7402243195", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials and Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"}, "36966300500": {"Name": "Keegan N.", "AuthorID": "36966300500", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Translational and Clinical Research Institute, Newcastle University"}, "57220497342": {"Name": "Short M.J.", "AuthorID": "57220497342", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department for International Trade, University College London"}, "57216111668": {"Name": "Pillay D.", "AuthorID": "57216111668", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "55436850500": {"Name": "Manley E.", "AuthorID": "55436850500", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, University of Leeds"}, "7103238630": {"Name": "Heymann D.", "AuthorID": "7103238630", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57203665921": {"Name": "Johnson A.M.", "AuthorID": "57203665921", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Global Health, University College London"}}}
