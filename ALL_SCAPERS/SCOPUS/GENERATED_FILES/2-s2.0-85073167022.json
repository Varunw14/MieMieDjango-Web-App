Re-use permitted under CC BY. Published by BMJ.Objectives To examine the prevalence of, and sociodemographic and smoking-related characteristics associated with, long-term e-cigarette use compared with long-term nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) use. Design Cross-sectional and prospective survey, the Smoking Toolkit Study, with baseline data collected between September 2014 and September 2016 and follow-ups at 6 and 12 months. Setting England. Participants Population representative sample of 40 933 adults aged 16+ years. Main outcome measures Prevalence of long-term (\u226512 months) use of e-cigarettes and NRT by retrospective self-report among baseline respondents (all adults, n=40 933; smokers, n=8406) and current use at baseline, 6 months and 12 months in a subsample of smokers who responded to follow-up (n=733). Results Of baseline respondents, 1.5% (95% CI 1.4% to 1.6%, n=604) of adults and 3.9% (95% CI 3.5% to 4.3%, n=327) of smokers were long-term e-cigarette users and 0.5% (95% CI 0.4% to 0.6%, n=205) of adults and 1.3% (95% CI 1.1% to 1.5%, n=112) of smokers were long-term NRT users. Assessed prospectively, 13.4% (95% CI 10.9% to 15.9%, n=100) of smokers were long-term e-cigarette users and 1.9% (95% CI 0.9% to 2.9%, n=14) were long-term NRT users. Among all adults, long-term use by never smokers of either e-cigarettes (0.1%, n=27) or NRT (0.0%, n=7) was rare. Among past-year smokers, long-term e-cigarette and NRT use was higher among older smokers compared with those who were 16-34 years old (OR range=1.55-5.21). Long-term e-cigarette use only was lower in smokers who were less educated (OR=0.63, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.81), from social grades C2DE (OR=0.66, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.84) and with children in the household (OR=0.66, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.85). Long-term e-cigarette use and long-term NRT use were higher among smokers more motivated to quit (OR=2.05, 95% CI 1.63 to 2.60 and OR=2.33, 95% CI 1.57 to 3.46). Conclusions In the adult population in England, long-term use of e-cigarettes and long-term use of NRT are almost exclusively by current or ex-smokers. Only a minority of past-year smokers retrospectively report long-term e-cigarette or NRT use, but this figure may be an underestimate, especially for e-cigarette use, which is more than threefold higher when assessed prospectively.", "AuthorKeywords": ["e-cigarettes", "long-term use", "nicotine replacement therapy", "population-based survey"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Correlation of Data", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nicotine", "Prevalence", "Prospective Studies", "Smoking", "Smoking Cessation", "Time Factors", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073167022", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57196323380": {"Name": "Jackson S.E.", "AuthorID": "57196323380", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "57211254854": {"Name": "Hill E.", "AuthorID": "57211254854", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "15123109500": {"Name": "Shahab L.", "AuthorID": "15123109500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "35224537600": {"Name": "Beard E.", "AuthorID": "35224537600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "55547124591": {"Name": "Brown J.", "AuthorID": "55547124591", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "7004779970": {"Name": "Michie S.", "AuthorID": "7004779970", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}}}
