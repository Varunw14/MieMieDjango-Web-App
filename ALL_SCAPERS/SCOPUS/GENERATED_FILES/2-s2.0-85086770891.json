This study tests whether services from Community Based Organisations (CBOs) in South Africa can promote children\u2019s resilience against depression exposed to such adversities. Two linked longitudinal studies were conducted, comprising n = 1848 children aged 9 to 13 years. One group received CBO services, whilst the other (quasi-control) did not. Analyses used interaction terms in regression models to test for potential moderation effects of CBO attendance, and marginal effects models to interpret significant interactions. Two interaction effects were shown, demonstrating moderation effects of CBO attendance on common structural disadvantages. First, children exposed to community violence showed increased depression (contrast = 0.62 [95%CI 0.43, 0.82], p '.001), but this association was removed by CBO access (contrast = 0.07 [95%CI \u22120.28, 0.43], p =.682). Second, children living in informal housing showed increased depression (contrast = 0.63 [95%CI 0.42, 0.85], p '.001), however, this association was removed by CBO access (contrast = 0.01 [95%CI \u22120.55, 0.56], p =.977). CBO attendance is associated with fewer depressive symptoms, and can buffer against important structural adversities of poor housing and violence that are common in high HIV-prevalence areas. However, CBO attendance was not able to remove the increased psychosocial distress associated with some family-level vulnerabilities such as orphanhood and abuse. These findings highlight the centrality of CBO-provided psychosocial support for children in Southern Africa, and suggest areas for bolstering provision.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Children", "depressive symptomology", "LMIC", "mental health", "South Africa"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086770891", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"35847280700": {"Name": "Sherr L.", "AuthorID": "35847280700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "57192892025": {"Name": "Roberts K.J.", "AuthorID": "57192892025", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "54788172900": {"Name": "Macedo A.", "AuthorID": "54788172900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "57078421200": {"Name": "Yakubovich A.R.", "AuthorID": "57078421200", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Evidence-Based Intervention, Department of Social Policy Social Intervention, University of Oxford"}, "17344948600": {"Name": "Cluver L.D.", "AuthorID": "17344948600", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Mental Health, University of Cape Town"}, "36802889900": {"Name": "Skeen S.", "AuthorID": "36802889900", "AffiliationID": "60001565", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Stellenbosch University"}, "57203053013": {"Name": "Tomlinson M.", "AuthorID": "57203053013", "AffiliationID": "60001565", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Stellenbosch University"}}}
