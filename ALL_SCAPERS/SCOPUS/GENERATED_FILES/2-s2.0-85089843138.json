However, the majority of work has been performed using manual segmentation, which is time consuming for large cohorts. MethodsWe investigated brainstem involvement in APS using an automated method. We measured the volume of the me-dulla, pons, superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP) and midbrain from T1-weighted MRIs in 67 patients and 42 controls. Diagnoses were corticobasal syndrome (CBS, n = 14), multiple system atrophy (MSA, n = 16: 8 with parkinsonian syndrome, MSA-P; 8 with cerebellar syndrome, MSA-C), progressive supranuclear palsy with a Richardson\u2019s syndrome (PSP-RS, n = 12), variant PSP (n = 18), and APS not otherwise specified (APS-NOS, n = 7). ResultsAll brainstem regions were smaller in MSA-C (19\u201342% volume difference, p < 0.0005) and in both PSP groups (18\u201333%, p < 0.0005) than in controls. MSA-P showed lower volumes in all regions except the SCP (15\u201326%, p < 0.0005). The most affected region in MSA-C and MSA-P was the pons (42% and 26%, respectively), while the most affected regions in both the PSP-RS and variant PSP groups were the SCP (33% and 23%, respectively) and midbrain (26% and 24%, respectively). The brainstem was less affected in CBS, but nonetheless, the pons (14%, p < 0.0005), midbrain (14%, p < 0.0005) and medulla (10%, p = 0.001) were signifi-cantly smaller in CBS than in controls. The brainstem was unaffected in APS-NOS. ConclusionAutomated methods can accurately quantify the involvement of brainstem structures in APS. This will be impor-tant in future trials with large patient numbers where manual segmentation is unfeasible.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brainstem", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Parkinsonian syndromes"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089843138", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"]], "AuthorData": {"54390725600": {"Name": "Bocchetta M.", "AuthorID": "54390725600", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57194327207": {"Name": "Russell L.L.", "AuthorID": "57194327207", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57207115089": {"Name": "Greaves C.V.", "AuthorID": "57207115089", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57207107370": {"Name": "Neason M.", "AuthorID": "57207107370", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "56410615100": {"Name": "Cash D.M.", "AuthorID": "56410615100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "35557252600": {"Name": "Warren J.D.", "AuthorID": "35557252600", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "14020386900": {"Name": "Rohrer J.D.", "AuthorID": "14020386900", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "35117674500": {"Name": "Iglesias J.E.", "AuthorID": "35117674500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57188682705": {"Name": "Chelban V.", "AuthorID": "57188682705", "AffiliationID": "124461339", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Institute of Emergency Medicine"}, "56494611500": {"Name": "Jabbari E.", "AuthorID": "56494611500", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Movement Disorders, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57190682198": {"Name": "Lamb R.", "AuthorID": "57190682198", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Movement Disorders, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57203900351": {"Name": "Woodside J.", "AuthorID": "57203900351", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Movement Disorders, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7003363686": {"Name": "Houlden H.", "AuthorID": "7003363686", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Movement Disorders, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7401534782": {"Name": "Morris H.R.", "AuthorID": "7401534782", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Movement Disorders, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "55485914900": {"Name": "Thomas D.L.", "AuthorID": "55485914900", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Leonard Wolfson Experimental Neurology Centre, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
