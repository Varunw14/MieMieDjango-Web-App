We present a pilot study that assess the reproducibility of the measurement of the tissue saturation (StO2) of the prefrontal cortex on a sample of 7 healthy adult volunteers. TD-NIRS measurements were acquired at 16 wavelengths, from 780 to 870 nm, in steps of 6 nm, and were fitted with the diffusion model for semi-infinite homogenous media. Then the absolute concentration of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin ([HbO2], [HHb]) were calculated using Beer-Lambert\u2019s law, in order to calculate the volunteer\u2019s brain tissue saturation (StO2 = [HbO2]/([HbO2]+[HHb])). Three measurement sessions were performed on three different days (within a week interval) to evaluate the mid-term reproducibility of the StO2. For each session, three measurements were taken (within 10 minutes, with repositioning of the probes) to evaluate the short-term reproducibility of the StO2. The reproducibility was expressed as the within-volunteer standard deviation (SDw), calculated using a one-way repeated-measure ANOVA. The SDw in session 1, 2 and 3 were 0.89%, 1.10% and 0.82% respectively, showing a good short-term reproducibility, and the SDw for all 3 sessions was 1.43%, showing a good mid-term reproducibility without significant variations in the StO2 between the 3 sessions. Moreover, the mean \u00b1 SD global values of StO2 over all the measurements (n=63) is 62.8+/- 4.2% which is close to the values reported in the literature for adults.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blood or tissue constituent monitoring", "Brain oximetry", "Brain tissue saturation", "Light propagation in tissues", "Medical optics instrumentation", "Photon migration", "Times domain NIRS", "Tissue characterization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cerebral tissues", "Deoxyhemoglobin", "Diffusion model", "Pilot studies", "Prefrontal cortex", "Repeated measures", "Reproducibilities", "Standard deviation"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084419419", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"]], "AuthorData": {"56803353300": {"Name": "Lange F.", "AuthorID": "56803353300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London, Malet Place Engineering Building"}, "6507301690": {"Name": "Tachtsidis I.", "AuthorID": "6507301690", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London, Malet Place Engineering Building"}}}
