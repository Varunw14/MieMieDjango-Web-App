Yet, a major challenge is how to efficiently incorporate commonsense knowledge into such models. A recent approach regularizes relation and entity representations by propositionalization of first-order logic rules. However, propositionalization does not scale beyond domains with only few entities and rules. In this paper we present a highly efficient method for incorporating implication rules into distributed representations for automated knowledge base construction. We map entity-tuple embeddings into an approximately Boolean space and encourage a partial ordering over relation embeddings based on implication rules mined from WordNet. Surprisingly, we find that the strong restriction of the entity-tuple embedding space does not hurt the expressiveness of the model and even acts as a regularizer that improves generalization. By incorporating few commonsense rules, we achieve an increase of 2 percentage points mean average precision over a matrix factorization baseline, while observing a negligible increase in runtime.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Commonsense knowledge", "Distributed representation", "Implication rules", "Knowledge-base construction", "Matrix factorizations", "NAtural language processing", "Percentage points", "Propositionalization"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072844216", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"]], "AuthorData": {"35415697600": {"Name": "Demeester T.", "AuthorID": "35415697600", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Ghent University - iMinds"}, "55899274800": {"Name": "Rockt\u00e4schel T.", "AuthorID": "55899274800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "36562438800": {"Name": "Riedel S.", "AuthorID": "36562438800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
