The mechanisms behind cognitive decline after anaesthesia and surgery are not known. We studied the association between CSF and blood biomarkers of neuronal injury or brain amyloidosis and long-term changes in neurocognitive function. Methods: In patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery (knee or hip replacement), blood and CSF samples were obtained before surgery and then at 4, 8, 24, 32, and 48 h after skin incision through an indwelling spinal catheter. CSF and blood concentrations of total tau (T-tau), neurofilament light, neurone-specific enolase and amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b21-42) were measured. Neurocognitive function was assessed using the International Study of Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction (ISPOCD) test battery 1\u20132 weeks before surgery, at discharge from the hospital (2\u20135 days after surgery), and at 3 months after surgery. Results: CSF and blood concentrations of T-tau, neurone-specific enolase, and A\u03b21-42 increased after surgery. A similar increase in serum neurofilament light was seen with no overall changes in CSF concentrations. There were no differences between patients having a poor or good late postoperative neurocognitive outcome with respect to these biomarkers of neuronal injury and A\u03b21-42. Conclusions: The findings of the present explorative study showed that major orthopaedic surgery causes a release of CSF markers of neural injury and brain amyloidosis, suggesting neuronal damage or stress. We were unable to detect an association between the magnitude of biomarker changes and long-term postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["amyloidosis", "biomarker", "cognitive dysfunction", "neuronal injury", "orthopaedic surgery", "postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction", "spinal anaesthesia"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095843656", "SubjectAreas": [["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"57204013590": {"Name": "Danielson M.", "AuthorID": "57204013590", "AffiliationID": "60031699, 60016437, 60027675", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "6603024325": {"Name": "Nellg\u00e5rd B.", "AuthorID": "6603024325", "AffiliationID": "60031699, 60016437, 60027675", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "56324400500": {"Name": "Oras J.", "AuthorID": "56324400500", "AffiliationID": "60031699, 60016437, 60027675", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "7004882547": {"Name": "Ricksten S.E.", "AuthorID": "7004882547", "AffiliationID": "60031699, 60016437, 60027675", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "25646858400": {"Name": "Wiklund A.", "AuthorID": "25646858400", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Section of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Karolinska Institutet"}, "7004596112": {"Name": "Mkrtchian S.", "AuthorID": "7004596112", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Section of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Karolinska Institutet"}, "24334462300": {"Name": "Fagerlund M.J.", "AuthorID": "24334462300", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Section of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Karolinska Institutet"}, "57206715848": {"Name": "Eriksson L.I.", "AuthorID": "57206715848", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Section of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Karolinska Institutet"}, "35419435200": {"Name": "Granath F.", "AuthorID": "35419435200", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Epidemiology, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet"}, "7101909602": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "7101909602", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "57208899083": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "57208899083", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, And UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL"}, "57215445339": {"Name": "Granstr\u00f6m A.", "AuthorID": "57215445339", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Function Perioperative Medicine and Intensive Care, Karolinska University Hospital"}, "56395516300": {"Name": "Schening A.", "AuthorID": "56395516300", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Function Perioperative Medicine and Intensive Care, Karolinska University Hospital"}, "7201874483": {"Name": "Rasmussen L.S.", "AuthorID": "7201874483", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, Centre of Head and Orthopaedics, Rigshospitalet, Institute of Clinical Medicine University of Copenhagen"}, "55667440400": {"Name": "Harris H.E.", "AuthorID": "55667440400", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Rheumatology Unit, Center for Molecular Medicine, Department for Medicine Solna, Karolinska Institutet"}}}
