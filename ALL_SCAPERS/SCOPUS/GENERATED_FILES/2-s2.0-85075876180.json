The modelling and analyses of the coil systems were implemented using the finite element method. Three coil systems were modelled-circular coils, rectangular coils and flux-pipe coil system using magnetic shields (Mumetal and electrical steel) and conductive shields (aluminum and copper). From the results presented in the analyses, it was noted that ohmic losses and core losses in the WPT system are independent of the type of conductive shield used. Similarly, it was noted that the self-inductance, coupling coefficient and losses in the system is affected by the type of magnetic shield used. For the flux-pipe resonant coil system, high power losses were recorded when a magnetic shield was used as the shielding topology while low power losses were recorded in the circular coil and rectangular coil resonant systems when the magnetic shield was used as the shielding material. For optimal WPT system requiring low eddy current losses, it was established that copper shield is the appropriate choice for flux-pipe resonant coils while electrical steel is the suitable shield material for the circular resonant coil and rectangular resonant coil systems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["conductive shield", "core losses", "coupling coefficient", "eddy current losses", "Finite element analysis", "magnetic shield", "ohmic losses", "self-inductance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Core loss", "Coupling coefficient", "Eddy current-loss", "Electrical steels", "Modelling and analysis", "Ohmic loss", "Shielding materials", "Wireless power transfer (WPT)"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075876180", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57205422440": {"Name": "Olukotun B.", "AuthorID": "57205422440", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Mechanical Engineering Department"}, "57190974668": {"Name": "Partridge J.S.", "AuthorID": "57190974668", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Mechanical Engineering Department"}, "7005111389": {"Name": "Bucknall R.W.G.", "AuthorID": "7005111389", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Mechanical Engineering Department"}}}
