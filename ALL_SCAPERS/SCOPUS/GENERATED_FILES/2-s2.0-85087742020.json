However, few studies have estimated the cost of the adjudication process. Methods: We estimated the cost of adjudicating the primary outcome in nine randomised stroke trials (25,436 participants). The costs included adjudicators\u2019 time, direct payments to adjudicators, and co-ordinating centre costs (e.g. uploading cranial scans and general set-up costs). The number of events corrected after adjudication was our measure of benefit. We calculated cost per corrected event for each trial and in total. Results: The primary outcome in all nine trials was either stroke or a composite that included stroke. In total, the adjudication process associated with this primary outcome cost in excess of \u00a3100,000 for a third of the trials (3/9). Mean cost per event corrected by adjudication was \u00a32295.10 (SD: \u00a31482.42). Conclusions: Central adjudication is a time-consuming and potentially costly process. These costs need to be considered when designing a trial and should be evaluated alongside the potential benefits adjudication brings to determine whether they outweigh this expense.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adjudication", "clinical trial", "stroke"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Humans", "Judgment", "Outcome Assessment, Health Care", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Stroke", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087742020", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"57193163196": {"Name": "Godolphin P.J.", "AuthorID": "57193163196", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at University College London, Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology"}, "7101801762": {"Name": "Montgomery A.A.", "AuthorID": "7101801762", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit, University of Nottingham"}, "24723490800": {"Name": "Bath P.M.", "AuthorID": "24723490800", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Trials Unit, Division of Clinical Neuroscience, University of Nottingham"}, "56050545500": {"Name": "Woodhouse L.J.", "AuthorID": "56050545500", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Trials Unit, Division of Clinical Neuroscience, University of Nottingham"}, "7102299895": {"Name": "Algra A.", "AuthorID": "7102299895", "AffiliationID": "60032724, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University"}, "55921098700": {"Name": "Berge E.", "AuthorID": "55921098700", "AffiliationID": "60105037", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Oslo University Hospital"}, "54912078200": {"Name": "Chalmers J.", "AuthorID": "54912078200", "AffiliationID": "60028333, 60104730", "AffiliationName": "The George Institute for Global Health, University of NSW"}, "56803501900": {"Name": "Eliasziw M.", "AuthorID": "56803501900", "AffiliationID": "60023143", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health and Community Medicine, Tufts University"}, "7102816661": {"Name": "Hankey G.J.", "AuthorID": "7102816661", "AffiliationID": "60031806, 60189720", "AffiliationName": "Medical School, The University of Western Australia"}, "7004492816": {"Name": "Hosomi N.", "AuthorID": "7004492816", "AffiliationID": "60166782", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience and Therapeutics, Hiroshima University Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences"}, "26768039500": {"Name": "Ranta A.", "AuthorID": "26768039500", "AffiliationID": "60017311", "AffiliationName": "University of Otago"}, "57202594354": {"Name": "Weimar C.", "AuthorID": "57202594354", "AffiliationID": "60007896", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Essen, Klinik f\u00fcr Neurologie"}}}
