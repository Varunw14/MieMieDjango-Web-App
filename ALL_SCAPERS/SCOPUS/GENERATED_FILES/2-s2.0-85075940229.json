Design of such robots poses challenges beyond standard rigid-body robots. A fast, reliable, accurate yet simple dynamic model is important to support the design, analysis, and control of hybrid rigid-continuum robots. In our previous work, we developed a modeling package for hybrid rigid-continuum systems, named TMTDyn. In this paper, we focus on how we developed an internal domain-specific language (DSL) using Matlab's OO capabilities and the concept of fluent interfaces to improve validation, understandability, and maintainability of the models constructed using TMTDyn. We present the language implementation, and discuss some of the benefits and challenges of building a Matlab-internal DSL.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dynamics", "Internal DSL", "Kinematics", "Matlab", "Soft Robots", "TMTDyn"], "IndexKeywords": ["Application area", "Continuum robot", "Continuum systems", "Domain specific languages", "Language implementations", "Soft robot", "TMTDyn", "Understandability"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075940229", "SubjectAreas": [["Automotive Engineering", "ENGI", "2203"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"57188663416": {"Name": "Sadati S.M.H.", "AuthorID": "57188663416", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London"}, "26422797000": {"Name": "Bergeles C.", "AuthorID": "26422797000", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London"}, "6507021067": {"Name": "Zschaler S.", "AuthorID": "6507021067", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, Faculty of Natural and Mathematical Sciences, King's College London"}}}
