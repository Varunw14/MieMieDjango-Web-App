Method: Data from patient satisfaction interviews was used to develop a child satisfaction questionnaire, which was used in two different centres after piloting. Results: The final questionnaire contained 7 questions and a comments section, using writing and facial images used to record children views. The questionnaire was distributed to 203 children; 95% were happy or okay with the waiting area, 69% were happy about seeing the dentist and 77% children were happy overall. Conclusion: Measures of satisfaction of children with regard to dental treatment were very different from those commonly used for adults. Further development and implementation of child satisfaction surveys should be considered.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Child", "Paediatric dentistry", "Patient participation", "Qualitative research", "Questionnaires"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091525321", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Dentistry (miscellaneous)", "DENT", "3501"]], "AuthorData": {"55205981300": {"Name": "Alazmah A.", "AuthorID": "55205981300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013985", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Dentistry, Eastman Dental Hospital, University College London"}, "14010574900": {"Name": "Parekh S.", "AuthorID": "14010574900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013985", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Dentistry, Eastman Dental Hospital, University College London"}, "7006826945": {"Name": "Ashley P.", "AuthorID": "7006826945", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013985", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Dentistry, Eastman Dental Hospital, University College London"}, "26631836000": {"Name": "Bhatia S.", "AuthorID": "26631836000", "AffiliationID": "60165526, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "University Dental Hospital, School of Dentistry, Cardiff University"}}}
