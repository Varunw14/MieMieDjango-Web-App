For subjective evaluation, the effects of sound source, differences in two directions (either towards or away from a sound source), and factors correlated to acoustic comfort remain unknown. This study employed soundwalk and field measurements with a questionnaire survey of a combination of room acoustics and soundscape indicators in two comparative sequential spaces with similar spatial compositions. The sound source resulted in changes to the perceived loudness, spaciousness, and reverberation. Loudness and reverberation showed a similar tendency. Other indicators, including clarity, listener envelopment, intimacy, warmth, acoustic comfort, annoyance, directivity, and overall impression were not affected. Moving in two directions resulted in different loudness and listener envelopment in the same room, both of which were stronger when moving towards the sound source. Even under the condition of a large spatial difference and a 6 dBA sound level difference, the difference in acoustic comfort in sequential spaces could be only about 0.1. The correlations between acoustic comfort and room acoustics indicators varied with the direction of movements.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acoustic comfort", "Sequential spaces", "Sound source", "Subjective evaluation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic comfort", "Listener envelopments", "Questionnaire surveys", "Sequential spaces", "Sound source", "Spatial composition", "Spatial differences", "Subjective evaluations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076043359", "SubjectAreas": [["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"]], "AuthorData": {"57212134606": {"Name": "Yang T.", "AuthorID": "57212134606", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering, The Bartlett, University College London (UCL)"}, "55485135500": {"Name": "Kang J.", "AuthorID": "55485135500", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering, The Bartlett, University College London (UCL)"}}}
