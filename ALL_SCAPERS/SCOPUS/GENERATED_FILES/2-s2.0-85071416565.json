In this work, the square-root raised cosine (SRRC) pulse is employed to generate the Hilbert pulse pair at the transmitter and an equivalent matched filter configuration is used to generate the receiver Hilbert pair. To verify the data rate gain of the proposed system, we generate the mathematical models and carry out simulations with varying compression factor of the SEFDM signals. The numerical modelling results show that the proposed system doubles the data rate relative to conventional SEFDM system with no bit error rate (BER) performance degradation. In addition, results are reported for un-coded transmission and also for system using turbo coding, showing significant BER improvement.", "AuthorKeywords": ["data rate", "Hilbert pair", "SEFDM", "spectral efficiency", "turbo coding"], "IndexKeywords": ["Data rates", "Hilbert pair", "SEFDM", "Spectral efficiencies", "Turbo coding"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071416565", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"]], "AuthorData": {"57209880796": {"Name": "Liu X.", "AuthorID": "57209880796", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, University College London"}, "7003497031": {"Name": "Darwazeh I.", "AuthorID": "7003497031", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, University College London"}}}
