These can be understood theoretically though considering them as individual networks\u2014e.g., epigenetic networks, cell-cell networks (such as astroglial networks), and population genetics. Mathematical modeling allows the combination of such networks so that they may be studied in unison, to better understand how the so-called \u201cseven pillars of aging\u201d combine and to generate hypothesis for treating aging as a condition at relatively early biological ages. In this review, we consider how recent progression in mathematical modeling can be utilized to investigate aging, particularly in, but not exclusive to, the context of degenerative neuronal disease. We also consider how the latest techniques for generating biomarker models for disease prediction, such as longitudinal analysis and parenclitic analysis can be applied to as both biomarker platforms for aging, as well as to better understand the inescapable condition. This review is written by a highly diverse and multi-disciplinary team of scientists from across the globe and calls for greater collaboration between diverse fields of research.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aging", "digital medicine", "inflammaging", "network analysis", "propagation of aging"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086269052", "SubjectAreas": [["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"56884397100": {"Name": "Whitwell H.J.", "AuthorID": "56884397100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "23388337200": {"Name": "Bacalini M.G.", "AuthorID": "23388337200", "AffiliationID": "60104781", "AffiliationName": "IRCCS Istituto delle Scienze Neurologiche di Bologna"}, "56020531500": {"Name": "Blyuss O.", "AuthorID": "56020531500", "AffiliationID": "60010188", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics and Paediatric Infectious Diseases, Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University (Sechenov University)"}, "7103103296": {"Name": "Zaikin A.", "AuthorID": "7103103296", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "7410249304": {"Name": "Chen S.", "AuthorID": "7410249304", "AffiliationID": "60087294", "AffiliationName": "Britton Chance Centre for Biomedical Photonics, Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics-Huazhong University of Science and Technology"}, "16052588800": {"Name": "Garagnani P.", "AuthorID": "16052588800", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine (DIMES), University of Bologna"}, "55328272900": {"Name": "Gordleeva S.Y.", "AuthorID": "55328272900", "AffiliationID": "60008673", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Systems Medicine of Healthy Aging, Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod"}, "8958614400": {"Name": "Kanakov O.", "AuthorID": "8958614400", "AffiliationID": "60008673", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Systems Medicine of Healthy Aging, Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod"}, "56236886700": {"Name": "Franceschi C.", "AuthorID": "56236886700", "AffiliationID": "60008673", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Information Technologies, Mathematics and Mechanics, Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod"}, "56152342900": {"Name": "Jalan S.", "AuthorID": "56152342900", "AffiliationID": "60104350", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Bio-Science and Bio-Medical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Indore"}, "6603861723": {"Name": "Ivanchenko M.", "AuthorID": "6603861723", "AffiliationID": "60008673", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Information Technologies, Mathematics and Mechanics, Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod"}, "50061625300": {"Name": "Kustikova V.", "AuthorID": "50061625300", "AffiliationID": "60008673", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Information Technologies, Mathematics and Mechanics, Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod"}, "36662508200": {"Name": "Meyerov I.", "AuthorID": "36662508200", "AffiliationID": "60008673", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Information Technologies, Mathematics and Mechanics, Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod"}, "7006140735": {"Name": "Mari\u00f1o I.P.", "AuthorID": "7006140735", "AffiliationID": "60018940", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology and Geology, Physics and Inorganic Chemistry, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos"}, "6603084108": {"Name": "Ullner E.", "AuthorID": "6603084108", "AffiliationID": "60015875", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics (SUPA), Institute for Complex Systems and Mathematical Biology, University of Aberdeen"}}}
