This was formed by comparing the Coulomb Quantum-Orbit Strong-Field Approximation (CQSFA) with B-spline Algebraic Diagrammatic Construction (ADC) simulations. This may lead to the identi-cation of initial momentum distributions, for tunneling and re-scattering instances, from the CQSFA perspective. The latter method is an inverse approach; thus, the ADC simulations will allow comparison of findings.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Algebraic diagrammatic constructions", "B splines", "Binding potential", "Core dynamics", "Initial momentum", "Inverse approach", "Quantum orbits", "Strong-field approximations"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087893478", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57217344779": {"Name": "Bray A.C.", "AuthorID": "57217344779", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56816436900": {"Name": "Maxwell A.S.", "AuthorID": "56816436900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56147334400": {"Name": "De Morisson Faria C.F.", "AuthorID": "56147334400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57194123928": {"Name": "Kissin Y.", "AuthorID": "57194123928", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Imperial College"}, "56232659500": {"Name": "Ruberti M.", "AuthorID": "56232659500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Imperial College"}, "57212682523": {"Name": "Khokhlova M.", "AuthorID": "57212682523", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Imperial College"}, "57203672950": {"Name": "Averbukh V.", "AuthorID": "57203672950", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Imperial College"}}}
