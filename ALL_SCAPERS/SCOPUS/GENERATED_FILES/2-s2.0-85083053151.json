These initial processing circuits can incorporate subcortical regions, such as the thalamus and brainstem nuclei, which mediate complex interactions with the brain\u2019s cortical processing hierarchy. These subcortical pathways, many of which we share with other animals, are not merely vestigial but appear to function as \u2018shortcuts\u2019 that ensure processing efficiency and preservation of vital life-preserving functions, such as harm avoidance, adaptive social interactions and efficient decision-making. Here, we propose that functional interactions between these higher-order and lower-order brain areas contribute to atypical sensory and cognitive processing that characterizes numerous neuropsychiatric disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Brain Stem", "Cerebral Cortex", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Humans", "Neural Pathways", "Sensation Disorders", "Thalamus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083053151", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"56538356500": {"Name": "McFadyen J.", "AuthorID": "56538356500", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "Queensland Brain Institute, University of Queensland"}, "57210439880": {"Name": "Dolan R.J.", "AuthorID": "57210439880", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "The Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, UCL"}, "16303496900": {"Name": "Garrido M.I.", "AuthorID": "16303496900", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Imaging, University of Queensland"}}}
