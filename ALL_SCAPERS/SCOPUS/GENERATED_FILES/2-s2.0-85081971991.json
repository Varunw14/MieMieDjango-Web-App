Through the synthesis of in-depth country case studies, this paper aims to identify current models of advanced practice and specialisation in pharmacy and illustrate trends, drivers and barriers in policy development. This is the first analysis of its kind to examine pharmacy specialisation and advanced practice in this depth from a global perspective. Methods: A synthesis of country case studies was carried out. The country case study template was reviewed and approved by an expert working group drawn from a cross section of International Pharmaceutical Federations (FIP) experts and special-interest groups. FIP member organisations and country-level contacts from regulatory, professional and government agencies and universities were approached to contribute to the case study database. The data were collected between January and May 2015. Descriptive comparative analysis and qualitative thematic analysis were both used to analyse the data. Key findings: Case study submissions were received from 17 countries. The findings demonstrate that the pace and depth of change in advanced practice and specialisation are occurring at different rates across countries and regions, although many countries appear to be moving towards recognising advanced and specialised practice of pharmacists and developing frameworks and/or formalised recognition systems. Conclusions: Country-specific examples are useful in identifying factors that may contribute to the rate at which developments in advanced practice and specialisation in pharmacy are taking place and enable progress in around the world.", "AuthorKeywords": ["advanced practice", "professional development", "scope of practice", "specialisation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Internationality", "Pharmaceutical Services", "Pharmacists", "Policy Making", "Qualitative Research", "Specialization"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081971991", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacy", "HEAL", "3611"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57188967236": {"Name": "Bader L.R.", "AuthorID": "57188967236", "AffiliationID": "124092017", "AffiliationName": "Lead for Workforce Transformation & Development, International Pharmaceutical Federation"}, "7006628298": {"Name": "Bates I.", "AuthorID": "7006628298", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL-FIP Collaborating Centre, School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "8581449700": {"Name": "Galbraith K.", "AuthorID": "8581449700", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Experiential Development & Graduate Education (EDGE), Monash Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University"}}}
