The atoms were initially prepared in the 1s55s S31 Rydberg level by two-color two-photon laser excitation from the metastable 1s2s S31 level. Two-photon microwave transitions between the 1s55s S31 and 1s56s S31 levels were then driven by the 19.556 GHz third-harmonic microwave field in a quarter-wave CPW resonator. This superconducting microwave resonator was fabricated from niobium nitride on a silicon substrate and operated at temperatures between 3.65 and 4.30 K. The populations of the Rydberg levels in the experiments were determined by state-selective pulsed electric field ionization. The coherence of the atom-resonator coupling was studied by time-domain measurements of Rabi oscillations.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Coplanar wave-guide (CPW)", "Microwave transitions", "Pulsed electric field", "Resonator coupling", "Silicon substrates", "Superconducting microwave resonators", "Time domain measurement", "Waveguide resonators"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085646447", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57204142533": {"Name": "Morgan A.A.", "AuthorID": "57204142533", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "17434872000": {"Name": "Hogan S.D.", "AuthorID": "17434872000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
