All rights reserved.In order to investigate the basic mechanical properties and stress strain relationship model for bamboo scrimber manufactured based on a new technique, a large quantities of experiments have been carried out. Based on the analysis of the test results, the following conclusions can be drawn. Two main typical failure modes were classified for bamboo scrimber specimens both under tension parallel to grain and tension perpendicular to grain. Brittle failure happened for all tensile tests. The slope values for the elastic stages have bigger discreteness compared with those for the specimens under tensile parallel to grain. The failure modes for bamboo scrimber specimens under compression parallel to grain could be divided into four. Only one main failure mode happened both for the bending specimens and the shear specimens. With the COV values of 28.64 and 25.72 respectively, the values for the strength and elastic modulus under tensile perpendicular to grain have the largest discreteness for bamboo scrimber. From the point of CHV values, the relationship among the mechanical parameters for bamboo scrimber were proposed based on the test results. Compared with other green building materials, bamboo scrimber manufactured based on a new technique has better mechanical performance and could be used in construction area. Three stress strain relationship models which are four-linear model, quadratic function model, and cubic function model were proposed for bamboo scrimber specimens manufactured based on a new technique. The latter two models gives better prediction for stress strain relationship in elastic plastic stage.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bamboo scrimber", "Parallel to grain", "Perpendicular to grain", "Strain relationship model", "Stress"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079170489", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (miscellaneous)", "MATE", "2501"], ["Environmental Science (miscellaneous)", "ENVI", "2301"]], "AuthorData": {"51763890000": {"Name": "Li H.", "AuthorID": "51763890000", "AffiliationID": "60025665", "AffiliationName": "College of Civil Engineering, Nanjing Forestry University"}, "57202782803": {"Name": "Zhang H.", "AuthorID": "57202782803", "AffiliationID": "60025665", "AffiliationName": "College of Civil Engineering, Nanjing Forestry University"}, "57208754266": {"Name": "Qiu Z.", "AuthorID": "57208754266", "AffiliationID": "60025665", "AffiliationName": "College of Civil Engineering, Nanjing Forestry University"}, "56188972800": {"Name": "Su J.", "AuthorID": "56188972800", "AffiliationID": "112682660", "AffiliationName": "Nanjing Technical Vocational College"}, "57190007698": {"Name": "Wei D.", "AuthorID": "57190007698", "AffiliationID": "121790549", "AffiliationName": "Jiangxi Feiyu Bamboo Stock Co.
