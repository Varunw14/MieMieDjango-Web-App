Herein, two series of stimuli-responsive amphiphilic 3-miktoarm star hybrid terpolypeptides and their corresponding linear analogues were synthesized exhibiting the same overall composition and molecular weight but different macromolecular architecture. The macromolecular architecture was found to be a key parameter in defining the morphology of the nanostructures formed in aqueous solutions as well as to alter the self-assembly behavior of the polymers independently of their composition. In addition, it was found that the assemblies prepared from the star-shaped polymers showed superior tolerance against enzymatic degradation due to the increased corona block density on the outer surface of the nanoparticles. Encapsulation of the hydrophobic anticancer drug Everolimus resulted in the formation of intriguing non-spherical and non-symmetric pH-responsive nanostructures, such as \"stomatocytes\" and \"multi-compartmentalized suprapolymersomes\", while the pH-triggered release of the drug was also investigated. Owing to the similarities of the developed \"stomatocytes\" with red blood cells, in combination with their pH-responsiveness and superior stability over enzymatic degradation, they are expected to present advanced drug delivery properties and have the ability to bypass several extra- and intracellular barriers to reach and effectively treat cancer cells.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Enzymatic Degradation", "Macromolecular architecture", "Ph responsiveness", "Self assembly process", "Self-assembly behaviors", "Star-shaped polymer", "Stimuli-responsive", "Triggered release", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Delayed-Action Preparations", "Everolimus", "Humans", "Hydrogels", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration", "Nanoparticles", "Neoplasms", "Peptides"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075443851", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Polymers and Plastics", "MATE", "2507"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"24484754200": {"Name": "Karatzas A.", "AuthorID": "24484754200", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "University of Athens, Department of Chemistry"}, "56380563900": {"Name": "Skoulas D.", "AuthorID": "56380563900", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "University of Athens, Department of Chemistry"}, "11139880300": {"Name": "Bilalis P.", "AuthorID": "11139880300", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "University of Athens, Department of Chemistry"}, "57113719900": {"Name": "Varlas S.", "AuthorID": "57113719900", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "University of Athens, Department of Chemistry"}, "57211941959": {"Name": "Apostolidi P.", "AuthorID": "57211941959", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "University of Athens, Department of Chemistry"}, "7004636195": {"Name": "Iatrou H.", "AuthorID": "7004636195", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "University of Athens, Department of Chemistry"}, "37052257400": {"Name": "Haataja J.S.", "AuthorID": "37052257400", "AffiliationID": "60103653", "AffiliationName": "Aalto University, Department of Applied Physics"}, "8734536400": {"Name": "Houbenov N.", "AuthorID": "8734536400", "AffiliationID": "60103653", "AffiliationName": "Aalto University, Department of Applied Physics"}, "7006529421": {"Name": "Ikkala O.", "AuthorID": "7006529421", "AffiliationID": "60103653", "AffiliationName": "Aalto University, Department of Applied Physics"}, "56161034200": {"Name": "Sofianopoulou S.", "AuthorID": "56161034200", "AffiliationID": "60084411", "AffiliationName": "Hellenic Republic, Ministry of Rural Development and Food"}, "6603120862": {"Name": "Stratikos E.", "AuthorID": "6603120862", "AffiliationID": "60001104", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Scientific Research Demokritos"}}}
