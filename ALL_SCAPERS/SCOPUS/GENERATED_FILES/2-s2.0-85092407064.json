However, little is known about what proportion of infectious people are asymptomatic and potential \u201csilent\u201d transmitters. We evaluated the value of COVID-19 symptoms as a marker for SARS-CoV-2 infection from a representative English survey. Methods: We used data from the Office for National Statistics Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey pilot study. We estimated sensitivity, specificity, the proportion of asymptomatic cases (1 \u2013 sensitivity), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of COVID-19 symptoms as a marker of infection using results of the SARS-CoV-2 test as the \u201cgold standard\u201d. Results: In total, there were 36,061 individuals with a SARS-CoV-2 test between 26 April and 27 June 2020. Of these, 625 (1.7%) reported symptoms on the day of the test. There were 115 (0.32%) with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. Of the 115, there were 27 (23.5%) who were symptomatic and 88 (76.5%) who were asymptomatic on the day of the test. Focusing on those with specific symptoms (cough, and/or fever, and/or loss of taste/smell), there were 158 (0.43%) with such symptoms on the day of the test. Of the 115 with a positive SARS-CoV-2, there were 16 (13.9%) reporting symptoms. In contrast, 99 (86.1%) did not report specific symptoms on the day of the test. The PPV for all symptoms was 4.3% and for the specific symptoms 10.1%. The specificity and NPV of symptoms were above 98%. Conclusion: COVID-19 symptoms are poor markers of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, 76.5% of this random sample who tested positive reported no symptoms, and 86.1% reported none of those specific to COVID-19. A more widespread testing programme is necessary to capture \u201csilent\u201d transmission and potentially prevent and reduce future outbreaks.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2", "COVID-19 symptoms", "SARS-CoV-2", "Sensitivity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092407064", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"]], "AuthorData": {"23009891600": {"Name": "Petersen I.", "AuthorID": "23009891600", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital"}, "57202558738": {"Name": "Phillips A.", "AuthorID": "57202558738", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}}}
