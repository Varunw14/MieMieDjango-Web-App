Material and Methods: We describe the history, findings of clinical examination, retinal imaging and electrodiagnostic studies, and the treatment of a patient with CNV secondary to OMS. Case Description: CNV secondary to OMS was diagnosed in a ten-year-old white female who presented with reduced visual acuity and a macular haemorrhage in her right eye. CNV was confirmed on optical coherence tomography. She was initially treated with a single injection of intravitreal bevacizumab and 2 years later with an injection of intravitreal ranibizumab for a recurrence. Although macular scarring secondary to the CNV was observed, her vision has stabilised and she continues to be closely monitored. Conclusion: We report the first case of CNV secondary to OMS and its successful treatment with intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections.", "AuthorKeywords": ["choroidal neovascularisation", "CNV", "congenital trichomegaly", "Oliver McFarlane syndrome", "PNPLA6"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087153566", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"57192067605": {"Name": "Makuloluwa A.K.", "AuthorID": "57192067605", "AffiliationID": "60023925", "AffiliationName": "St. Paul\u2019s Eye Unit, Royal Liverpool University Hospital"}, "57217383679": {"Name": "Dodeja R.", "AuthorID": "57217383679", "AffiliationID": "60024418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Alder Hey Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "16053052400": {"Name": "Madhusudhan S.", "AuthorID": "16053052400", "AffiliationID": "60023925", "AffiliationName": "St. Paul\u2019s Eye Unit, Royal Liverpool University Hospital"}, "7003721937": {"Name": "Gonzalez-Martin J.", "AuthorID": "7003721937", "AffiliationID": "60024418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Alder Hey Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "57200827164": {"Name": "Georgiou M.", "AuthorID": "57200827164", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57202482672": {"Name": "Michaelides M.", "AuthorID": "57202482672", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57220450527": {"Name": "Hagan R.", "AuthorID": "57220450527", "AffiliationID": "60023925", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrophysiology, Royal Liverpool University Hospital"}}}
