The characteristics of the ACLF patients can change very rapidly within a short period of time. Continuous assessment of their recovery status is critical for clinicians to adjust and deliver effective treatment. The aim of this paper is to validate the usefulness of a data preparation approach by combining different criteria to replace missing values, balance target-class variables, select useful patient characteristics and optimise hyperparameters of machine learning models for the prediction of ACLF associated mortality rates. A key step in the data preparation is a feature selection Mutual Information (MI) based multivariate approach to build smaller, and yet equally and in some cases more informative, subsets of patient characteristics than those frequently proposed for the prediction of mortality, from patients with ACLF in the CANONIC dataset. The usefulness of the data preparation approach proposed to predict mortality was evaluated by training the XGBoost and Logistic Regression models with the prepared data. Evaluations of the models trained using a test set provided evidence of an overall high accuracy in the prediction of the mortality rates of patients for days after their diagnosis, and in some cases even higher when reduced and more informative subsets of patient characteristics were found.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acute-on-chronic liver failure", "Chronic liver disease", "Continuous assessment", "Data preparation", "Logistic regression models", "Machine learning models", "Multivariate approach", "Mutual informations", "Acute-On-Chronic Liver Failure", "Europe", "Humans", "Liver Cirrhosis", "Logistic Models"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077883126", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"57212612350": {"Name": "Garcia M.S.", "AuthorID": "57212612350", "AffiliationID": "60107958", "AffiliationName": "IBM"}, "57213592133": {"Name": "Doyle G.", "AuthorID": "57213592133", "AffiliationID": "60107958", "AffiliationName": "IBM"}, "57213591813": {"Name": "Ranco G.", "AuthorID": "57213591813", "AffiliationID": "60107958", "AffiliationName": "IBM"}, "57189926149": {"Name": "Arroyo V.", "AuthorID": "57189926149", "AffiliationID": "123764200", "AffiliationName": "European Foundation for the Study of Chronic Liver Failure"}, "7006180749": {"Name": "Pavesi M.", "AuthorID": "7006180749", "AffiliationID": "123764200", "AffiliationName": "European Foundation for the Study of Chronic Liver Failure"}, "57213609493": {"Name": "Garcia E.", "AuthorID": "57213609493", "AffiliationID": "123764200", "AffiliationName": "European Foundation for the Study of Chronic Liver Failure"}, "7003721843": {"Name": "Saliba F.", "AuthorID": "7003721843", "AffiliationID": "60014856", "AffiliationName": "H\u00f4pital Paul Brousse"}, "7005488420": {"Name": "Banares R.", "AuthorID": "7005488420", "AffiliationID": "60033237", "AffiliationName": "Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n"}, "56668177200": {"Name": "Fernandez J.", "AuthorID": "56668177200", "AffiliationID": "60030315", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Clinic"}, "15749911500": {"Name": "Agarwal B.", "AuthorID": "15749911500", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver Disease Health Royal Free Hospital"}, "6603672216": {"Name": "Mookerjee R.P.", "AuthorID": "6603672216", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7005505892": {"Name": "Jalan R.", "AuthorID": "7005505892", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
