In the same year, Ratnoff and Davie in the USA reached the same conclusion. Macfarlane and Rosemary Biggs had previously, in 1952, discovered factor IX as the factor deficient in haemophilia B. In 1973, Arthur Bloom defined the distinct role of Factor VIII and von Willebrand factor in haemophilia A and von Willebrand\u2019s disease respectively. This inspired the efforts of Tuddenham and his group towards the purification of Factor VIII which reached homogeneity in 1982, leading to the cloning of the Factor VIII gene in 1984 in collaboration with US scientists at Genentech, which in turn enabled development of safe recombinant factor concentrates for patients with haemophilia. Brownlee cloned the factor IX gene in 1982 at the Sir William Dunn Institute of Pathology in Oxford. This led eventually to the first successful trial of gene therapy for haemophilia B in 2011 by the Nathwani group at UCL, which built on pioneering work of US groups and was partnered with St Jude in Memphis where Nathwani started the project. This trial has fuelled the current quest for a functional cure of haemophilia A and B. The UK has, therefore, made a rich contribution to advances in haemostasis over the last 60 years, often in partnership with other groups across the world.", "AuthorKeywords": ["blood coagulation", "enzyme cascade", "haemophilia"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096074141", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"6603785385": {"Name": "Nathwani A.C.", "AuthorID": "6603785385", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Cancer Institute"}, "7005950243": {"Name": "Tuddenham E.G.D.", "AuthorID": "7005950243", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Haemophila Centre and Thrombosis Unit, University College London"}}}
