Forty-two walnuts were scanned with a laboratory X-ray set-up to provide not only data from a single object but from a class of objects with natural variability. For each walnut, CB projections on three different source orbits were acquired to provide CB data with different cone angles as well as being able to compute artefact-free, high-quality ground truth images from the combined data that can be used for supervised learning. We provide the complete image reconstruction pipeline: raw projection data, a description of the scanning geometry, pre-processing and reconstruction scripts using open software, and the reconstructed volumes. Due to this, the dataset can not only be used for high cone-angle artefact reduction but also for algorithm development and evaluation for other tasks, such as image reconstruction from limited or sparse-angle (low-dose) scanning, super resolution, or segmentation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073747212", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"], ["Library and Information Sciences", "SOCI", "3309"]], "AuthorData": {"55750207000": {"Name": "Der Sarkissian H.", "AuthorID": "55750207000", "AffiliationID": "60011575", "AffiliationName": "Centrum Wiskunde en Informatica, Computational Imaging group"}, "52364146500": {"Name": "Lucka F.", "AuthorID": "52364146500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "56204979200": {"Name": "van Eijnatten M.", "AuthorID": "56204979200", "AffiliationID": "60011575", "AffiliationName": "Centrum Wiskunde en Informatica, Computational Imaging group"}, "57215317438": {"Name": "Colacicco G.", "AuthorID": "57215317438", "AffiliationID": "60011575", "AffiliationName": "Centrum Wiskunde en Informatica, Computational Imaging group"}, "57190261284": {"Name": "Coban S.B.", "AuthorID": "57190261284", "AffiliationID": "60011575", "AffiliationName": "Centrum Wiskunde en Informatica, Computational Imaging group"}, "55879451400": {"Name": "Batenburg K.J.", "AuthorID": "55879451400", "AffiliationID": "60019816", "AffiliationName": "Leiden University, Department of Mathematics"}}}
