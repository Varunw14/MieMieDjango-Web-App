For this purpose a temperature-responsive hydrogel poly(N-vinylcaprolactam-co-hyaluronic acid) (p(VCL-co-HA)) was prepared through aqueous emulsion polymerization with a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved p(VCL) and hyaluronic acid (HA) showing remarkably high LA drug loading capacity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Drug loading capacity", "Food and Drug Administration", "Hydrogel nanoparticles", "Local anaesthetic", "Temperature-responsive hydrogels", "Transdermal"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078705486", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"37112868500": {"Name": "Ozkahraman B.", "AuthorID": "37112868500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biophysics Group, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56355181500": {"Name": "Emeriewen K.", "AuthorID": "56355181500", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital Nhs Foundation Trust"}, "12779593000": {"Name": "Saleh G.M.", "AuthorID": "12779593000", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60172674, 60022148, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Insitute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital, Ucl Institute of Opthalmology"}, "7005152034": {"Name": "Thanh N.T.K.", "AuthorID": "7005152034", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Ucl Healthcare Biomagnetic and Nanomaterials Laboratories, University College London"}}}
