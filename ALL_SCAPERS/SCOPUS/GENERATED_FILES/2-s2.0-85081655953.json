This paper presents sedimentologic data and provenance analysis of Upper Paleozoic sandstones in Longyan, which are rich in quartz (73\u201390%) and poor in lithic fragments (2\u201312%) and feldspar (3\u201325%). Devonian sandstones contain mostly metamorphic lithic fragments (e.g., quartzite), whereas Carboniferous-Permian sandstones contain mostly felsic volcanic and subvolcanic lithic fragments indicating provenance from felsic volcanic rocks. Detrital zircon U-Pb age spectra of Devonian-Carboniferous sandstones display modes at ~440 Ma and 420\u2013380 Ma, with subordinate Mesoproterozoic age components, pointing at the Nanling terrane and the western-middle part of the Wuyi terrane as most likely ultimate sediment sources. Permian sandstones inherited the age components mentioned above, but also include peaks at ~290 Ma and ~1850 Ma. The ~290 Ma component corresponds to the age of Late Paleozoic magmatism in southeastern China and southwest Japan. Numerous detrital zircons aged at 350\u2013250 Ma also occur in Permo-Triassic strata exposed across South China and southwest Japan. Based on regional data and on the ages and Hf isotope signatures of detrital zircon, we infer that a Late Paleozoic continental arc existed in the coastal area of southeastern China and contributed detritus to the adjacent sedimentary basins. The Permo-Triassic igneous rocks locally exposed in the area may represent the remnant of that continental arc. Arc growth may have been responsible for the westward retreat of a broad Upper Paleozoic carbonate platform.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carbonate platform", "Continental arc", "Late Paleozoic", "Sedimentary provenance", "South China", "Tectonic setting"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carbonate platforms", "Continental arc", "Late Paleozoic", "Sedimentary provenance", "South China", "Tectonic settings"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081655953", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"]], "AuthorData": {"57212301086": {"Name": "Li C.", "AuthorID": "57212301086", "AffiliationID": "60026846", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Oil and Gas Reservoir Geology and Exploitation (Chengdu University of Technology), Institute of Sedimentary Geology"}, "7404709350": {"Name": "Hu X.", "AuthorID": "7404709350", "AffiliationID": "60033100", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Mineral Deposit Research, School of Earth Sciences and Engineering, Nanjing University"}, "37048081800": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "37048081800", "AffiliationID": "60019499, 60109828", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Lithospheric Evolution, Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "6507304421": {"Name": "Vermeesch P.", "AuthorID": "6507304421", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60162129", "AffiliationName": "London Geochronology Centre, University College London"}, "7003625845": {"Name": "Garzanti E.", "AuthorID": "7003625845", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Universit\u00e0 di Milano-Bicocca"}}}
