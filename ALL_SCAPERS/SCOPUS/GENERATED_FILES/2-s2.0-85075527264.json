Methods: Antibiotic prescriptions and antibiograms for neonates, infants and older children with UTI admitted to a general district hospital in Central Greece were evaluated. Data covering a 5-year period were collected retrospectively from the Paediatric Department's Electronic Clinical Archive. Patients were included based on clinical and microbiological criteria. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the Kirby\u2013Bauer disk diffusion method. Results: A total of 230 patients were included in the study. Among 459 prescriptions identified, amikacin (31.2%) was the most common antibiotic prescribed in this population, followed by amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (17.4%) and ampicillin (13.5%). Children received prolonged intravenous (i.v.) treatments for febrile (mean \u00b1 S.D., 5.4 \u00b1 1.45 days) and afebrile UTIs (mean \u00b1 S.D., 4.4 \u00b1 1.64 days). A total of 236 pathogens were isolated. The main causative organism was Escherichia coli (79.2%) with high reported resistance rates to ampicillin (42.0%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (26.5%) and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (12.2%); lower resistance rates were identified for third-generation cephalosporins (1.7%), nitrofurantoin (2.3%), ciprofloxacin (1.4%) and amikacin (0.9%). Klebsiella spp. isolates were highly resistant to cefaclor (27.3%). Conclusion: High prescribing rates for amikacin and penicillins (\u00b1 \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors) and prolonged i.v. treatments were observed. Escherichia coli was highly resistant to ampicillin, whilst third-generation cephalosporins exhibited greater in vitro efficacy. Establishment of antimicrobial stewardship programmes and regular monitoring of antimicrobial resistance could help to minimise inappropriate prescribing for UTIs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antibiotic prescribing", "Antimicrobial resistance", "Children", "Urinary tract infection", "UTI"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075527264", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"]], "AuthorData": {"57199223559": {"Name": "Vazouras K.", "AuthorID": "57199223559", "AffiliationID": "60021061", "AffiliationName": "Second Department of Pediatrics, Aghia Sophia Children\u0384s Hospital, Agia Sophia Hospital"}, "35375757600": {"Name": "Zaoutis T.", "AuthorID": "35375757600", "AffiliationID": "60030118, 60003711", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, UPENN School of Medicine, Philadelphia"}, "55057756400": {"Name": "Jackson C.", "AuthorID": "55057756400", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Infectious Diseases Research Group, Institute for Infection and Immunity, St George's University of London"}, "35068032100": {"Name": "Hsia Y.", "AuthorID": "35068032100", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, Queen's University Belfast"}, "57211969502": {"Name": "Velali K.", "AuthorID": "57211969502", "AffiliationID": "60067083, 60021061, 60028900", "AffiliationName": "First Department of Pediatrics, Aghia Sophia Children's Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "57211961309": {"Name": "Tassiou I.", "AuthorID": "57211961309", "AffiliationID": "60011038", "AffiliationName": "Paediatrics Department, University Hospital of Larissa"}, "55388364700": {"Name": "Anastasiou-Katsiardani A.", "AuthorID": "55388364700", "AffiliationID": "60084963", "AffiliationName": "Paediatrics Department, Achillopouleion General Hospital of Volos"}, "57211962772": {"Name": "Athanasopoulou K.", "AuthorID": "57211962772", "AffiliationID": "60084963", "AffiliationName": "Microbiology Department, Achillopouleion General Hospital of Volos"}, "24576561800": {"Name": "Barbouni A.", "AuthorID": "24576561800", "AffiliationID": "60110806", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health Policy, School of Public Health, University of West Attica"}, "35361980400": {"Name": "Folgori L.", "AuthorID": "35361980400", "AffiliationID": "60002200, 60030318", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Infectious Disease Unit, Department of Paediatrics, Luigi Sacco Hospital, University of Milan"}, "36442218500": {"Name": "Basmaci R.", "AuthorID": "36442218500", "AffiliationID": "60123665, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Paris, Infection, Antimicrobiens, Mod\u00e9lisation, Evolution, Unit\u00e9 Mixte de Recherche 1137, Institut National de la Sant\u00e9 Et de la Recherche M\u00e9dicale"}}}
