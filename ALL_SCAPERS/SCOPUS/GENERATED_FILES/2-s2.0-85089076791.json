Methods Internet-based survey by invitation of IBD services across the UK from 8 to 14 April 2020. Results Respondents from 125 IBD services completed the survey. The number of whole-time equivalent gastroenterologists and IBD nurses providing elective outpatient care decreased significantly between baseline (median 4, IQR 4-7.5 and median 3, IQR 2-4) to the point of survey (median 2, IQR 1-4.8 and median 2, IQR 1-3) in the 6-week period following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Almost all (94%; 112/119) services reported an increase in IBD helpline activity. Face-to-face clinics were substituted for telephone consultation by 86% and video consultation by 11% of services. A variation in the provision of laboratory faecal calprotectin testing was noted with 27% of services reporting no access to faecal calprotectin, and a further 32% reduced access. There was also significant curtailment of IBD-specific endoscopy and elective surgery. Conclusions IBD services in the UK have implemented several adaptive strategies in order to continue to provide safe and high-quality care for patients. National Health Service organisations will need to consider the impact of these changes in current service delivery models and staffing levels when planning exit strategies for post-pandemic IBD care. Careful planning to manage the increased workload and to maintain IBD services is essential to ensure patient safety.", "AuthorKeywords": ["health service research", "infectious disease", "inflammatory bowel disease"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089076791", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"52463723400": {"Name": "Kennedy N.A.", "AuthorID": "52463723400", "AffiliationID": "60006326", "AffiliationName": "Gastroenterology, Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57200873815": {"Name": "Hansen R.", "AuthorID": "57200873815", "AffiliationID": "60190225", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Gastroenterology, Royal Hospital for Children"}, "24774247500": {"Name": "Younge L.", "AuthorID": "24774247500", "AffiliationID": "60022734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, St Mark's Hospital, Academic Institute"}, "9238545400": {"Name": "Mawdsley J.", "AuthorID": "9238545400", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Guy's and Saint Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8424102200": {"Name": "Irving P.M.", "AuthorID": "8424102200", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Guy's and Saint Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7006629700": {"Name": "Beattie R.M.", "AuthorID": "7006629700", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"}, "19933743900": {"Name": "Din S.", "AuthorID": "19933743900", "AffiliationID": "60013999", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Western General Hospital"}, "57201798989": {"Name": "Lees C.W.", "AuthorID": "57201798989", "AffiliationID": "60013999", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Western General Hospital"}, "26533011400": {"Name": "Lamb C.A.", "AuthorID": "26533011400", "AffiliationID": "60001239", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57218304182": {"Name": "Smith P.J.", "AuthorID": "57218304182", "AffiliationID": "60160274", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "12789097200": {"Name": "Selinger C.", "AuthorID": "12789097200", "AffiliationID": "60012508", "AffiliationName": "Gastroenterology, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "55990071000": {"Name": "Limdi J.", "AuthorID": "55990071000", "AffiliationID": "60009274", "AffiliationName": "Section of Ibd, Division of Gastroenterology, Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "57188770606": {"Name": "Iqbal T.H.", "AuthorID": "57188770606", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "Gastroenterology, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"}, "19933686600": {"Name": "Cooney R.", "AuthorID": "19933686600", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "Gastroenterology, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7102068568": {"Name": "Lobo A.", "AuthorID": "7102068568", "AffiliationID": "60024453", "AffiliationName": "Academic Department of Gastroenterology, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "26530922100": {"Name": "Brain O.", "AuthorID": "26530922100", "AffiliationID": "60170323, 60008936", "AffiliationName": "Translational Gastroenterology Unit, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57195337722": {"Name": "Gaya D.R.", "AuthorID": "57195337722", "AffiliationID": "60018058", "AffiliationName": "Gastroenterology, Glasgow Royal Infirmary"}, "57202223898": {"Name": "Murray C.", "AuthorID": "57202223898", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Gastroenterology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603865038": {"Name": "Pollok R.", "AuthorID": "6603865038", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, St George's University of London"}, "35269059200": {"Name": "Kent A.", "AuthorID": "35269059200", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Gastroenterology, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004687229": {"Name": "Raine T.", "AuthorID": "7004687229", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "Gastroenterology, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "15759186000": {"Name": "Bhala N.", "AuthorID": "15759186000", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, University Hospital Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7201432421": {"Name": "Lindsay J.O.", "AuthorID": "7201432421", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "7006244921": {"Name": "Sebastian S.", "AuthorID": "7006244921", "AffiliationID": "60005954", "AffiliationName": "IBD Unit, Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"}}}
