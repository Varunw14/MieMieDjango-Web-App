We compare brain structure sensitivity to verbal interference control across two groups, English monolingual (N = 41) and multilingual (N = 46) adults. Using voxel-based morphometry, our primary goal was to identify and explore differences in regional patterns of grey matter sensitivity to performance on the sentence interpretation task, controlling for group variability in age, nonverbal reasoning and vocabulary knowledge. There was no group difference in performance but there was a significant group effect in grey matter sensitivity to task performance in our region of interest: stronger sensitivity in the paravermis in bilinguals compared to monolinguals in accuracy performance in the high (relative to low) verbal interference condition. This effect was observed when the linguistic interference was presented in an unfamiliar language (Greek) but not when presented in the familiar language (English). Our findings suggest that multilanguage acquisition mediates regional involvement within the language network, conferring enhanced functional plasticity within structures (including the paravermis) in the service of control of linguistic interference.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Brain Mapping", "Female", "Gray Matter", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multilingualism", "Speech Perception", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083578785", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"36142674300": {"Name": "Filippi R.", "AuthorID": "36142674300", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MULTAC (Multilanguage and Cognition Lab), Institute of Education, University College London"}, "57215418249": {"Name": "Tomas E.P.", "AuthorID": "57215418249", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MULTAC (Multilanguage and Cognition Lab), Institute of Education, University College London"}, "57203992808": {"Name": "Papageorgiou A.", "AuthorID": "57203992808", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MULTAC (Multilanguage and Cognition Lab), Institute of Education, University College London"}, "7005381462": {"Name": "Bright P.", "AuthorID": "7005381462", "AffiliationID": "60000913", "AffiliationName": "Anglia Ruskin University"}}}
