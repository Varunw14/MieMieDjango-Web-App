Methods: We performed a community-based needs assessment adapting Demographic and Health survey methodology with additional questions determining female health literacy on cervical cancer and assessing the availability and need for cervical cancer screening services. We surveyed women (N = 121) across all households in six communities along the Lower Napo River, Loreto, Peru, in May 2015. Data were collected as part of the larger Amazon Community Based Participation Cervical Cancer Screen-and-Treat Programme. Survey data were compared to national results from ENDES 2014. Results: Comparison between our findings and the ENDES 2014 survey highlighted considerable inequality between indigenous or mixed indigenous, rural populations in Loreto, Peru, and national population data averages over level of formal education, literacy, barriers to accessing healthcare and maternal and sexual health. Even though only 5.9% (N = 7/117) of women had no formal health insurance coverage, money was reported as the leading barrier accessing healthcare (N = 88/117, 75.2%). Health literacy regarding cervical and breast cancer was poor. A high proportion of women highlighted fear of screening processes (70.8%, N = 80/113) and lack of available services (53.6%, N = 60/112) as barriers to cervical cancer screening. Conclusion: Although progress has been made in improving healthcare access in Peru, such gains have not been experienced equitably and women living in remote communities face persistent marginalization regarding their health. There is a significant need for education related to and screening for cervical cancer in this region that is tailored to the reality of women\u2019s lives in remote communities in Loreto.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amazon", "cervical cancer", "inequality", "non-communicable diseases", "Peru", "prevention", "screening"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Early Detection of Cancer", "Female", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Health Literacy", "Health Services Accessibility", "Humans", "Mass Screening", "Middle Aged", "Needs Assessment", "Peru", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Uterine Cervical Neoplasms", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076517644", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57212392234": {"Name": "Collins J.H.", "AuthorID": "57212392234", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "37066519500": {"Name": "Shannon G.", "AuthorID": "37066519500", "AffiliationID": "123683599", "AffiliationName": "DB Peru"}, "57203916499": {"Name": "Bowie D.", "AuthorID": "57203916499", "AffiliationID": "123683599", "AffiliationName": "DB Peru"}}}
