Cuticular defects caused by mutations in cuticular protein-encoding genes can obstruct melanin deposition. The effects of changes in melanin on the expression of cuticular protein-encoding genes, the cuticular and morphological traits, and the origins of these effects are unknown. We found that the cuticular physical characteristics and the expression patterns of larval cuticular protein-encoding genes markedly differed between the melanic and non-melanic integument regions. By using four p multiple-allele color pattern mutants with increasing degrees of melanism (+p, pM, pS, and pB), we found that the degree of melanism and the expression of four RR1-type larval cuticular protein-encoding genes (BmCPR2, BmLcp18, BmLcp22, and BmLcp30) were positively correlated. By modulating the content of melanin precursors and the expression of cuticular protein-encoding genes in cells in tissues and in vivo, we showed that this positive correlation was due to the induction of melanin precursors. More importantly, the melanism trait introduced into the BmCPR2 deletion strain Dazao-stony induced up-regulation of three other similar chitin-binding characteristic larval cuticular protein-encoding genes, thus rescuing the cuticular, morphological and adaptability defects of the Dazao-stony strain. This rescue ability increased with increasing melanism levels. This is the first study reporting the induction of cuticular protein-encoding genes by melanin and the biological importance of this induction in affecting the physiological characteristics of the cuticle.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bombyx mori", "Cuticle features", "Cuticular protein-encoding genes", "Induction", "Melanic coloring"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Bombyx", "Genes, Insect", "Insect Proteins", "Larva", "Melanins", "Mutation", "Up-Regulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078100967", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Insect Science", "AGRI", "1109"]], "AuthorData": {"57193835213": {"Name": "Yan Z.w.", "AuthorID": "57193835213", "AffiliationID": "60122052, 60087826", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Silkworm Genome Biology, Key Laboratory of Sericultural Biology and Genetic Breeding, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, College of Biotechnology, Southwest University"}, "55342377700": {"Name": "Xiong G.", "AuthorID": "55342377700", "AffiliationID": "60122052, 60087826", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Silkworm Genome Biology, Key Laboratory of Sericultural Biology and Genetic Breeding, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, College of Biotechnology, Southwest University"}, "57213139071": {"Name": "Wang R.x.", "AuthorID": "57213139071", "AffiliationID": "60122052, 60087826", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Silkworm Genome Biology, Key Laboratory of Sericultural Biology and Genetic Breeding, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, College of Biotechnology, Southwest University"}, "55673332000": {"Name": "Hu H.", "AuthorID": "55673332000", "AffiliationID": "60122052, 60087826", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Silkworm Genome Biology, Key Laboratory of Sericultural Biology and Genetic Breeding, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, College of Biotechnology, Southwest University"}, "56430099600": {"Name": "Song J.b.", "AuthorID": "56430099600", "AffiliationID": "60122052, 60087826", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Silkworm Genome Biology, Key Laboratory of Sericultural Biology and Genetic Breeding, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, College of Biotechnology, Southwest University"}, "25624012300": {"Name": "Tong X.l.", "AuthorID": "25624012300", "AffiliationID": "60122052, 60087826", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Silkworm Genome Biology, Key Laboratory of Sericultural Biology and Genetic Breeding, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, College of Biotechnology, Southwest University"}, "55341892000": {"Name": "He S.z.", "AuthorID": "55341892000", "AffiliationID": "60122052, 60087826", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Silkworm Genome Biology, Key Laboratory of Sericultural Biology and Genetic Breeding, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, College of Biotechnology, Southwest University"}, "55733532500": {"Name": "Lu C.", "AuthorID": "55733532500", "AffiliationID": "60122052, 60087826", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Silkworm Genome Biology, Key Laboratory of Sericultural Biology and Genetic Breeding, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, College of Biotechnology, Southwest University"}, "36087195400": {"Name": "Dai F.y.", "AuthorID": "36087195400", "AffiliationID": "60122052, 60087826", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Silkworm Genome Biology, Key Laboratory of Sericultural Biology and Genetic Breeding, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, College of Biotechnology, Southwest University"}, "55209635000": {"Name": "Qiao L.", "AuthorID": "55209635000", "AffiliationID": "60010752", "AffiliationName": "Chongqing Key Laboratory of Vector Insects, Institute of Entomology and Molecular Biology, College of Life Sciences, Chongqing Normal University"}, "24337903600": {"Name": "Hao Y.j.", "AuthorID": "24337903600", "AffiliationID": "60010752", "AffiliationName": "Chongqing Key Laboratory of Vector Insects, Institute of Entomology and Molecular Biology, College of Life Sciences, Chongqing Normal University"}, "57214093108": {"Name": "Che L.r.", "AuthorID": "57214093108", "AffiliationID": "60010752", "AffiliationName": "Chongqing Key Laboratory of Vector Insects, Institute of Entomology and Molecular Biology, College of Life Sciences, Chongqing Normal University"}, "56244315600": {"Name": "Chen B.", "AuthorID": "56244315600", "AffiliationID": "60010752", "AffiliationName": "Chongqing Key Laboratory of Vector Insects, Institute of Entomology and Molecular Biology, College of Life Sciences, Chongqing Normal University"}, "7202284097": {"Name": "Mallet J.", "AuthorID": "7202284097", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, Harvard University"}}}
