All rights reserved.Autoimmunity is implicated in a small but important group of peripheral nerve diseases. These include the acute inflammatory neuropathies eponymously referred to as the Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) and Fisher syndrome (FS), and the chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP), both idiopathic and associated with a serum paraprotein. Substantial evidence exists for an autoimmune pathogenesis in GBS and its subtypes. The evidence is still gathering to support similar processes in the chronic inflammatory neuropathies including the demyelinating neuropathy associated with antibodies to myelin-associated glycoprotein. Although the most current evidence supports an antibody-driven pathogenesis triggered by infection for GBS and FS, T-cell mechanisms predominate in CIDP, and other cellular immune components are crucial effectors of disease. Experimental allergic neuritis, an inflammatory model of neuropathy, has been instructive in the detailed study of the pathogenesis of immune-mediated neuropathies and will be discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acute motor axonal neuropathy", "Autoimmunity", "Fisher syndromes", "Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome", "Macrophage"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081286223", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"]], "AuthorData": {"7004224851": {"Name": "Lunn M.P.T.", "AuthorID": "7004224851", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "8762966800": {"Name": "Lehmann H.C.", "AuthorID": "8762966800", "AffiliationID": "60008658", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Hospital of Cologne"}, "35793094600": {"Name": "Sheikh K.A.", "AuthorID": "35793094600", "AffiliationID": "60021568", "AffiliationName": "University of Texas Medical School at Houston"}}}
