However, it remains unclear how many cores should be applied per target. Objective: To assess sPC detection rates of two different target-dependent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)-fusion biopsy approaches (TB and target saturation [TS]) compared with extended systematic biopsies (SBs). Design, setting, and participants: Retrospective single-centre outcome of transperineal MRI/TRUS-fusion biopsies of 213 men was evaluated. All men underwent TB with a median of four cores per MRI lesion, followed by a median of 24 SBs, performed by experienced urologists. Cancer and sPC (International Society of Urological Pathology grade group \u22652) detection rates were analysed. TB was compared with SB and TS, with nine cores per target, calculated by the Ginsburg scheme and using individual cores of the lesion and its \u201cpenumbra\u201d. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Cancer detection rates were calculated for TS, TB, and SB at both lesion and patient level. Combination of SB + TB served as a reference. Statistical differences in prostate cancer (PC) detection between groups were calculated using McNemar's tests with confidence intervals. Results and limitations: TS detected 99% of 134 sPC lesions, which was significantly higher than the detection by TB (87%, p = 0.001) and SB (82%, p < 0.001). SB detected significantly more of the 72 low-risk PC lesions than TB (99% vs 68%, p < 0.001) and 10% (p = 0.15) more than that detected by TS. At a per-patient level, 99% of men harbouring sPC were detected by TS. This was significantly higher than that by TB and SB (89%, p = 0.03 and 81%, p = 0.001, respectively). Limitations include limited generalisability, as a transperineal biopsy route was used. Conclusions: TS detected significantly more cases of sPC than TB and extended SB. Given that both 99% of sPC lesions and men harbouring sPC were identified by TS, the results suggest that this approach allows to omit SB cores without compromising sPC detection. Patient summary: Target saturation of magnetic resonance imaging\u2013suspicious prostate lesions provides excellent cancer detection and finds fewer low-risk tumours than the current gold standard combination of targeted and systematic biopsies.\u00a9 2020Target saturation (TS) detected significantly more significant prostate cancers (sPC) than targeted and systematic biopsies. Given that 99% of lesions and men harbouring sPC were identified by TS alone, this approach allows omitting systematic biopsy without compromising tumour detection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Detection accuracy of target saturation biopsy", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Magnetic resonance imaging/transrectal ultrasound fusion", "Prostate cancer", "Target saturation", "Targeted biopsy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087743243", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"35079437300": {"Name": "Tschirdewahn S.", "AuthorID": "35079437300", "AffiliationID": "60007896", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University Hospital Essen"}, "57147500400": {"Name": "P\u00fcllen L.", "AuthorID": "57147500400", "AffiliationID": "60007896", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University Hospital Essen"}, "56678606500": {"Name": "Panic A.", "AuthorID": "56678606500", "AffiliationID": "60007896", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University Hospital Essen"}, "56525275000": {"Name": "Kesch C.", "AuthorID": "56525275000", "AffiliationID": "60007896", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University Hospital Essen"}, "57188208100": {"Name": "Darr C.", "AuthorID": "57188208100", "AffiliationID": "60007896", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University Hospital Essen"}, "56973347700": {"Name": "He\u00df J.", "AuthorID": "56973347700", "AffiliationID": "60007896", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University Hospital Essen"}, "16229968900": {"Name": "Hadaschik B.", "AuthorID": "16229968900", "AffiliationID": "60007896", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University Hospital Essen"}, "55553100700": {"Name": "Radtke J.P.", "AuthorID": "55553100700", "AffiliationID": "60017059", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)"}, "36444977300": {"Name": "Wiesenfarth M.", "AuthorID": "36444977300", "AffiliationID": "60017059", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biostatistics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)"}, "7801375734": {"Name": "Bonekamp D.", "AuthorID": "7801375734", "AffiliationID": "60017059", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)"}, "57200732461": {"Name": "Reis H.", "AuthorID": "57200732461", "AffiliationID": "60014264", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pathology, University Duisburg-Essen"}, "55646665800": {"Name": "Giganti F.", "AuthorID": "55646665800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "7402982572": {"Name": "Moore C.M.", "AuthorID": "7402982572", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56857529500": {"Name": "Guberina N.", "AuthorID": "56857529500", "AffiliationID": "60007896", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, University Hospital Essen"}, "55545275600": {"Name": "Forsting M.", "AuthorID": "55545275600", "AffiliationID": "60007896", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, University Hospital Essen"}, "6602288924": {"Name": "Wetter A.", "AuthorID": "6602288924", "AffiliationID": "60007896", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, University Hospital Essen"}}}
