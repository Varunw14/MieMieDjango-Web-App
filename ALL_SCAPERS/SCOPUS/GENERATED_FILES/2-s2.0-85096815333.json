Available data indicate low breakthrough bleed rates and potentially improved long-term joint health for patients treated with rFVIIIFc prophylaxis. Objective: This study assessed the cost effectiveness of rFVIIIFc versus rFVIII from an Italian healthcare perspective. Methods: A Semi-Markov model was constructed to assess the lifetime costs and benefits of rFVIII and rFVIIIFc prophylaxis. rFVIII product acquisition costs from a published Italian database were included for both prophylaxis and the resolution of breakthrough bleeding. Clinical outcomes within the model were determined based on published annualized bleeding rates and literature regarding the development of target joints (TJs) as the incidence of bleeds and TJs is associated with impaired health-related quality of life. Cost effectiveness was assessed using cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Results: Compared with rFVIII, rFVIIIFc was associated with a per-patient cost saving of approximately \u20ac1.3 million and QALY gains of 0.39 over a lifetime horizon. Sensitivity analyses considering alternative efficacy, dosing, and structural assumptions each showed that rFVIIIFc dominated rFVIII (i.e., provided more QALYs at a reduced cost). Conclusions: This cost-effectiveness analysis demonstrated that rFVIIIFc may offer a cost-effective treatment option for patients with SHA in Italy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096815333", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"56966665700": {"Name": "Bullement A.", "AuthorID": "56966665700", "AffiliationID": "121016418", "AffiliationName": "Delta Hat"}, "57209645012": {"Name": "McMordie S.T.", "AuthorID": "57209645012", "AffiliationID": "121016418", "AffiliationName": "Delta Hat"}, "56414854100": {"Name": "Hatswell A.J.", "AuthorID": "56414854100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57218991407": {"Name": "Li N.", "AuthorID": "57218991407", "AffiliationID": "121307980", "AffiliationName": "Bioverativ, a Sanofi Company"}, "57210399178": {"Name": "Wilson K.", "AuthorID": "57210399178", "AffiliationID": "60025972", "AffiliationName": "Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (publ)"}}}
