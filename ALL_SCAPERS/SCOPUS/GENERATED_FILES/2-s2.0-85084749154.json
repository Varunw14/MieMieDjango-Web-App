However, while a Galerkin discretisation only depends on the domain space and the test (or dual) space of the operator, products require a notion of the range. In the boundary element software package Bempp, we have implemented a complete operator algebra that depends on knowledge of the domain, range, and test space. The aim was to develop a way of working with Galerkin operators in boundary element software that is as close to working with the strong form on paper as possible, while hiding the complexities of Galerkin discretisations. In this article, we demonstrate the implementation of this operator algebra and show, using various Laplace and Helmholtz example problems, how it significantly simplifies the definition and solution of a wide range of typical boundary integral equation problems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["boundary element software", "Boundary integral equations", "operator preconditioning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Boundary integral operators", "Discretisation", "Helmholtz", "Operator algebras", "Strong form", "Test space"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084749154", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"23102173100": {"Name": "Betcke T.", "AuthorID": "23102173100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "57192094932": {"Name": "Scroggs M.W.", "AuthorID": "57192094932", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge"}, "24367332400": {"Name": "\u015amigaj W.", "AuthorID": "24367332400", "AffiliationID": "60018258", "AffiliationName": "Met Office"}}}
