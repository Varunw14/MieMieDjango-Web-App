However, the complex 3D flow-fields demonstrated previously face manufacturing challenges, such as requiring selective laser sintering, an additive manufacturing method that is expensive to scale up. Here, a lung-inspired cathode flow-field is introduced and fabricated using low-cost, lightweight printed circuit boards (PCB). The uniformity and alignment between individual PCB layers producing the fractal hierarchy of flow channels have been characterised using X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT). The performance of the fractal flow-field exceeds that of conventional single-serpentine flow-fields and is particularly beneficial when operating on air with a low relative humidity. The lung-inspired design is shown to lead to a more stable operation than the single-serpentine design, as a result of uniform distribution of reactants.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fractal flow-field", "Lung-inspired", "Polarisation", "Printed circuit board", "X-ray computed tomography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Fractal flows", "Low relative humidities", "Lung-inspired", "Manufacturing challenges", "Polymer electrolyte fuel cells", "Printed circuit boards (PCB)", "Uniform distribution", "X-ray computed tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073954854", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Nuclear Energy and Engineering", "ENER", "2104"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"]], "AuthorData": {"57217167125": {"Name": "Bethapudi V.S.", "AuthorID": "57217167125", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "22954519900": {"Name": "Trogadas P.", "AuthorID": "22954519900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EPSRC \u201cFrontier Engineering\u201d Centre for Nature Inspired Engineering & Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57200341790": {"Name": "Cho J.I.S.", "AuthorID": "57200341790", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EPSRC \u201cFrontier Engineering\u201d Centre for Nature Inspired Engineering & Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "54790515100": {"Name": "Coppens M.O.", "AuthorID": "54790515100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EPSRC \u201cFrontier Engineering\u201d Centre for Nature Inspired Engineering & Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57202026518": {"Name": "Hack J.", "AuthorID": "57202026518", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57201197910": {"Name": "Rasha L.", "AuthorID": "57201197910", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.R.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.J.L.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56140429400": {"Name": "Hinds G.", "AuthorID": "56140429400", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}}}
