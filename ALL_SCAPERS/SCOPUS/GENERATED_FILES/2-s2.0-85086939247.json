Public policies designed to reduce transmission have made it extremely difficult to meet with service-users safely in the traditional face-to-face context. E-therapies have existed in theory and practice since technological progress has made them possible. They can offer a host of advantages over face-to-face equivalents, including improved access, greater flexibility for service-users and professionals, and cost savings. However, despite the emerging evidence and anticipated positive value, implementation has been slower than anticipated. Concerns have been raised by service-users, clinicians, and public health organisations, identifying significant barriers to the wide spread use of e-therapies. In the current climate, many clinicians are offering e-therapies for the first time, without prior arrangement or training, as the only viable option to continue to support their clients. This paper offers a clinically relevant review of the e-therapies literature, including effectiveness and acceptability dilemmas and challenges that need to be addressed to support the safe use and growth of e-therapies in psychology services. Further research is needed to better understand what might be lost and what gained in comparison to face-to-face therapy, and for which client groups and settings it might be most effective.", "AuthorKeywords": ["covid-19", "E-therapies", "face-to-face therapies", "paediatric psychology", "psychological support", "remote therapies", "telemental health", "telepsychology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Attitude of Health Personnel", "Betacoronavirus", "Child", "Coronavirus Infections", "Humans", "Pandemics", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Pneumonia, Viral", "Psychiatry", "Psychology", "Psychotherapy, Group", "Telemedicine", "Telephone", "Treatment Outcome", "Videoconferencing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086939247", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57217252022": {"Name": "Payne L.", "AuthorID": "57217252022", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Child and Adolescent Psychology Service, University College London Hospital"}, "55210776400": {"Name": "Flannery H.", "AuthorID": "55210776400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Child and Adolescent Psychology Service, University College London Hospital"}, "57217258491": {"Name": "Kambakara Gedara C.", "AuthorID": "57217258491", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Child and Adolescent Psychology Service, University College London Hospital"}, "57217257694": {"Name": "Daniilidi X.", "AuthorID": "57217257694", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Child and Adolescent Psychology Service, University College London Hospital"}, "57217250183": {"Name": "Hitchcock M.", "AuthorID": "57217250183", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Child and Adolescent Psychology Service, University College London Hospital"}, "57209500994": {"Name": "Lambert D.", "AuthorID": "57209500994", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Child and Adolescent Psychology Service, University College London Hospital"}, "57217257981": {"Name": "Taylor C.", "AuthorID": "57217257981", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Child and Adolescent Psychology Service, University College London Hospital"}, "7102638286": {"Name": "Christie D.", "AuthorID": "7102638286", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Child and Adolescent Psychology Service, University College London Hospital"}}}
