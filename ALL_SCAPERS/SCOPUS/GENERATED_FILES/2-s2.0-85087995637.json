In this special issue we reconsider the use of this term in human remains research, to untangle what we actually mean when we say \u201cstress\u201d in archaeology. To this aim, we looked at this topic from two broad perspectives: dental anthropology and paleopathology. Based on revision of the previous work on this topic, the new contributions of this issue, and in the light of the rapid advancement in other medical disciplines, we conclude that the term \u201cstress\u201d is not suitable for the study of archaeological skeletal remains unless it is precisely defined (e.g. mechanical stress).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dental anthropology", "Paleopathology", "Skeletal remains", "Stress"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087995637", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"57219121108": {"Name": "Edinborough M.", "AuthorID": "57219121108", "AffiliationID": "60118550, 60026553", "AffiliationName": "Melbourne Dental School, Melbourne Dental School, The University of Melbourne"}, "55020435400": {"Name": "Rando C.", "AuthorID": "55020435400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}}}
