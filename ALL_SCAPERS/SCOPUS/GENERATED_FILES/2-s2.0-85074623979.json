HTT mRNA contains 67 exons and does not always splice between exon 1 and exon 2 leading to the production of a small polyadenylated HTTexon1 transcript, and the full-length HTT mRNA has three 3\u2032UTR isoforms. We have developed a QuantiGene multiplex panel for the simultaneous detection of all of these mouse Htt transcripts directly from tissue lysates and demonstrate that this can replace the more work-intensive Taqman qPCR assays. We have applied this to the analysis of brain regions from the zQ175 HD mouse model and wild type littermates at two months of age. We show that the incomplete splicing of Htt occurs throughout the brain and confirm that this originates from the mutant and not endogenous Htt allele. Given that HTTexon1 encodes the highly pathogenic exon 1 HTT protein, it is essential that the levels of all Htt transcripts can be monitored when evaluating HTT lowering approaches. Our QuantiGene panel will allow the rapid comparative assessment of all Htt transcripts in cell lysates and mouse tissues without the need to first extract RNA.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["3' Untranslated Regions", "Animals", "Brain", "Branched DNA Signal Amplification Assay", "Disease Models, Animal", "Exons", "High-Throughput Screening Assays", "Huntingtin Protein", "Introns", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Neurologic Mutants", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Organ Specificity", "Protein Isoforms", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "RNA Splicing", "RNA, Messenger"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074623979", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"24315114300": {"Name": "Papadopoulou A.S.", "AuthorID": "24315114300", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Huntington\u2019s Disease Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease and UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL, Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57211619404": {"Name": "Gomez-Paredes C.", "AuthorID": "57211619404", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Huntington\u2019s Disease Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease and UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL, Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57211619578": {"Name": "Mason M.A.", "AuthorID": "57211619578", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Huntington\u2019s Disease Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease and UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL, Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57211619601": {"Name": "Taxy B.A.", "AuthorID": "57211619601", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Huntington\u2019s Disease Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease and UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL, Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "35380748900": {"Name": "Bates G.P.", "AuthorID": "35380748900", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Huntington\u2019s Disease Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease and UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL, Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7003562939": {"Name": "Howland D.", "AuthorID": "7003562939", "AffiliationID": "60096697", "AffiliationName": "CHDI Management/CHDI Foundation Inc."}}}
