Though most commonly encountered in the setting of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, a number of neurodegenerative, structural, metabolic and toxic neurological disorders can result in parkinsonism. Accurately diagnosing the underlying cause of parkinsonism is of both therapeutic and prognostic relevance, especially as we enter the era of disease-modifying treatment trials for neurodegenerative disorders. Being aware of the wide array of potential causes of parkinsonism is of paramount importance for clinicians. In this chapter, we present a pragmatic clinical approach to patients with parkinsonism, specifically focusing on \u2018red flags\u2019, which should alert one to consider diagnoses other than idiopathic Parkinson's disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atypical parkinsonian disorders", "Lewy body disease", "Multiple system atrophy", "Parkinson disease", "Red flags", "Supranuclear palsy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Parkinsonian Disorders"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075362413", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"37361346500": {"Name": "Mulroy E.", "AuthorID": "37361346500", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "25958636400": {"Name": "Bhatia K.P.", "AuthorID": "25958636400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "57208560010": {"Name": "Stamelou M.", "AuthorID": "57208560010", "AffiliationID": "60012556", "AffiliationName": "Clinic for Neurology, Philipps University"}}}
