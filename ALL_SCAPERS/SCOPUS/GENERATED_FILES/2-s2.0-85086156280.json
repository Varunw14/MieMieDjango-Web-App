This study combines the assessment of multiple stress and inflammatory biomarkers in late pregnancy and after delivery in order to investigate cross-sectional and prospective associations with perinatal depressive symptoms. Methods: One-hundred-ten healthy women were assessed in late pregnancy (mean gestational age=34.76; SD=1.12) and 89 were re-evaluated after delivery (mean hours after delivery=52.36; SD=19.70) for depressive and anxiety symptoms through the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Serum Interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and diurnal salivary cortisol levels were measured on both occasions, while diurnal salivary alpha amylase (sAA) levels were assessed in late pregnancy. Results: Using Hierarchical Linear Models, higher depressive symptoms were found to be associated with higher IL-6 levels, lower morning cortisol levels and a flatter cortisol diurnal slope during pregnancy, while adjusting for potential confounders. No significant associations were found after delivery or with change in biomarker levels from pre- to post-partum. Furthermore, preliminary evidence of a positive association between inflammation and stress markers in women with higher antenatal depressive symptoms was found. Limitations: The sample was relatively small and highly selected, thus limiting generalizability of the findings. Conclusions: Results emphasize the need for an integrated multi-systems approach to the understanding of the biological underpinnings of perinatal depression and suggest that the stress-immune interactions represent a promising avenue for future endeavor.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alpha-amylase", "Cortisol", "Depression", "Inflammation", "Postpartum", "Pregnancy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086156280", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57196049790": {"Name": "Nazzari S.", "AuthorID": "57196049790", "AffiliationID": "60083538", "AffiliationName": "Scientific Institute, IRCCS Eugenio Medea, Child Psychopathology Unit"}, "7003273958": {"Name": "Fearon P.", "AuthorID": "7003273958", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "57191708571": {"Name": "Ciceri F.", "AuthorID": "57191708571", "AffiliationID": "60083538", "AffiliationName": "Scientific Institute, IRCCS Eugenio Medea, Child Psychopathology Unit"}, "7003975446": {"Name": "Molteni M.", "AuthorID": "7003975446", "AffiliationID": "60083538", "AffiliationName": "Scientific Institute, IRCCS Eugenio Medea, Child Psychopathology Unit"}, "7005544625": {"Name": "Frigerio A.", "AuthorID": "7005544625", "AffiliationID": "60083538", "AffiliationName": "Scientific Institute, IRCCS Eugenio Medea, Child Psychopathology Unit"}, "7004377110": {"Name": "Rice F.", "AuthorID": "7004377110", "AffiliationID": "60023998, 60170145", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics, Division of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neurosciences, Cardiff University"}}}
