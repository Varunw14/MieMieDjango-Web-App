This study is aimed at determining the incidence of mesh-associated complications and reoperation following this procedure. Methods: This was a cross-sectional postal questionnaire study of women who underwent laparoscopic mesh sacrohysteropexy between 2010 and 2018. Potential participants were identified from surgical databases of five surgeons at two tertiary urogynaecology centres in the UK. The primary outcome was patient-reported mesh complication requiring removal of hysteropexy mesh. Secondary outcomes included other mesh-associated complications, reoperation rates and Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) in prolapse symptoms. Descriptive statistics and Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analyses were used. Results: Of 1,766 eligible participants, 1,121 women responded (response proportion 63.5%), at a median follow-up of 46 months. The incidence of mesh complications requiring removal of hysteropexy mesh was 0.4% (4 out of 1,121). The rate of chronic pain service use was 1.8%, and newly diagnosed systemic autoimmune disorders was 5.8%. The rate of reoperation for apical prolapse was 3.7%, and for any form of pelvic organ prolapse it was 13.6%. For PGI-I, 81.4% of patients were \u201cmuch better\u201d or \u201cvery much better\u201d. Conclusions: Laparoscopic mesh sacrohysteropexy has a low incidence of reoperation for mesh complications and apical prolapse, and a high rate of patient-reported improvement in prolapse symptoms. With appropriate clinical governance measures, the procedure offers an alternative to vaginal hysterectomy with apical suspension. However, long-term comparative studies are still required.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Laparoscopy", "Pelvic organ prolapse", "Reoperation", "Surgical mesh", "Uterine prolapse"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087476858", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"], ["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"57217386539": {"Name": "Izett-Kay M.L.", "AuthorID": "57217386539", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL EGA Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "55547210700": {"Name": "Kupelian A.S.", "AuthorID": "55547210700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Urogynaecology and Pelvic Floor Unit, University College London Hospitals, Clinic 2"}, "55671672200": {"Name": "Cutner A.S.", "AuthorID": "55671672200", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Urogynaecology and Pelvic Floor Unit, University College London Hospitals, Clinic 2"}, "6603437159": {"Name": "Vashisht A.", "AuthorID": "6603437159", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL EGA Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "57217680461": {"Name": "Aldabeeb D.", "AuthorID": "57217680461", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL EGA Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "15043860700": {"Name": "Cartwright R.", "AuthorID": "15043860700", "AffiliationID": "60008323, 60170323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urogynaecology, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford University Hospitals"}, "26326307900": {"Name": "Jackson S.", "AuthorID": "26326307900", "AffiliationID": "60008323, 60170323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urogynaecology, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford University Hospitals"}, "16033743200": {"Name": "Price N.", "AuthorID": "16033743200", "AffiliationID": "60008323, 60170323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urogynaecology, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford University Hospitals"}}}
