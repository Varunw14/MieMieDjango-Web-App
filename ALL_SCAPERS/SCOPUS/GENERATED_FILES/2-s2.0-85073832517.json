This was used to visualise and quantitate changes to porosity, tortuosity and permeability based on simulation of flow through the packed bed structure using the imaging data. When using a high flow rate it was found that a decrease in porosity could be measured during compression before reverting after flow had ceased, with corresponding changes to tortuosity and permeability also occurring. X-ray CT imaging of packed beds and individual beads exposed to foulant-rich process streams resulted in considerable image quality loss, associated with residual biological material. In order to address this, digital processing using an erosion-dilation method was applied at bead and bed scales to computationally alter the porosity by adding or removing material from the existing surface to calculate the impact upon tortuosity factor. The eroded and dilated bead volumes of agarose, cellulose and ceramic materials were used to simulate diffusivity whilst mimicking internal bead pore constriction and blocking mechanisms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Compression", "Imaging", "Packed bed", "Structure", "X-ray computed tomography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bed structures", "Blocking mechanisms", "Erosion dilations", "High-flow rate", "Packed column", "Process streams", "Tortuosity factor", "X-ray computed tomography", "Cellulose", "Computer Simulation", "Porosity", "Pressure", "Rheology"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073832517", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"57211553890": {"Name": "Johnson T.F.", "AuthorID": "57211553890", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London, Bernard Katz"}, "6602592324": {"Name": "Bracewell D.G.", "AuthorID": "6602592324", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London, Bernard Katz"}, "56901064000": {"Name": "Iacoviello F.", "AuthorID": "56901064000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.R.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57211413211": {"Name": "Hayden D.J.", "AuthorID": "57211413211", "AffiliationID": "120896573", "AffiliationName": "Pall Biotech"}, "57202785323": {"Name": "Welsh J.H.", "AuthorID": "57202785323", "AffiliationID": "120896573", "AffiliationName": "Pall Biotech"}, "7004608115": {"Name": "Levison P.R.", "AuthorID": "7004608115", "AffiliationID": "120896573", "AffiliationName": "Pall Biotech"}}}
