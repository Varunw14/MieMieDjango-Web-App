Computer-assisted planning (CAP) has been shown to improve trajectory safety metrics and generate clinically feasible trajectories in a fraction of the time needed for manual planning. We report a prospective validation study of the use of EpiNav (UCL, London, UK) as a clinical decision support software for SEEG. Thirteen consecutive patients (125 electrodes) undergoing SEEG were prospectively recruited. EpiNav was used to generate 3D models of critical structures (including vasculature) and other important regions of interest. Manual planning utilizing the same 3D models was performed in advance of CAP. CAP was subsequently employed to automatically generate a plan for each patient. The treating neurosurgeon was able to modify CAP generated plans based on their preference. The plan with the lowest risk score metric was stereotactically implanted. In all cases (13/13), the final CAP generated plan returned a lower mean risk score and was stereotactically implanted. No complication or adverse event occurred. CAP trajectories were generated in 30% of the time with significantly lower risk scores compared to manually generated. EpiNav has successfully been integrated as a clinical decision support software (CDSS) into the clinical pathway for SEEG implantations at our institution. To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study of a complex CDSS in stereotactic neurosurgery and provides the highest level of evidence to date.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clinical decision support software", "Computer-assisted planning", "Epilepsy", "EpiNav", "SEEG"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Decision Making, Computer-Assisted", "Decision Support Systems, Clinical", "Drug Resistant Epilepsy", "Electrodes, Implanted", "Electroencephalography", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Prospective Studies", "Stereotaxic Techniques", "Surgery, Computer-Assisted"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071318385", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"54954062300": {"Name": "Vakharia V.N.", "AuthorID": "54954062300", "AffiliationID": "100387573", "AffiliationName": "Chalfont Centre for Epilepsy"}, "57215499053": {"Name": "Miserocchi A.", "AuthorID": "57215499053", "AffiliationID": "100387573", "AffiliationName": "Chalfont Centre for Epilepsy"}, "35307885500": {"Name": "Rodionov R.", "AuthorID": "35307885500", "AffiliationID": "100387573", "AffiliationName": "Chalfont Centre for Epilepsy"}, "57204026204": {"Name": "McEvoy A.W.", "AuthorID": "57204026204", "AffiliationID": "100387573", "AffiliationName": "Chalfont Centre for Epilepsy"}, "7401893026": {"Name": "Duncan J.S.", "AuthorID": "7401893026", "AffiliationID": "100387573", "AffiliationName": "Chalfont Centre for Epilepsy"}, "57219298090": {"Name": "Sparks R.", "AuthorID": "57219298090", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, St Thomas\u2019 Hospital, King\u2019s College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, St Thomas\u2019 Hospital, King\u2019s College London"}, "36931857600": {"Name": "Vos S.B.", "AuthorID": "36931857600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60022106", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust EPSRC Interventional and Surgical Sciences, University College London"}, "57188737908": {"Name": "O\u2019Keeffe A.", "AuthorID": "57188737908", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}}}
