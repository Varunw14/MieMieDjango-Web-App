Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.Whilst the formation of plastic nanoparticles (nanoplastics) from plastic wastes has been unequivocally evidenced, little is known about the effects of these materials on living organisms at the subcellular or molecular levels. In the present contribution we show through molecular dynamics simulations that polyethylene nanoparticles dissolve in the hydrophobic core of lipid bilayers into a network of disentangled, single polymeric chains. The thereby induced structural and dynamic changes in the bilayer alter vital functions of the cell membrane, which if lacking a mechanism to decompose the polymer chains may result in the death of the cell.", "AuthorKeywords": ["environmental effects", "membranes", "molecular dynamics", "nanoplastics", "phospholipid bilayers"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dynamic changes", "Hydrophobic core", "Living organisms", "Molecular dynamics simulations", "Molecular levels", "Nanoplastics", "Phospholipid bilayer", "Polymeric chain", "Cell Membrane", "Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions", "Lipid Bilayers", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Nanoparticles", "Polyethylene"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073959031", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"12780913500": {"Name": "Holl\u00f3czki O.", "AuthorID": "12780913500", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Mulliken Center for Theoretical Chemistry, University of Bonn"}, "57190608959": {"Name": "Gehrke S.", "AuthorID": "57190608959", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Mulliken Center for Theoretical Chemistry, University of Bonn"}}}
