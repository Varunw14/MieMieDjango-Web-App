The widespread use of these nanoparticles has increased the likelihood of their release to aquatic ecosystems and their effects on aquatic organisms. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate the histopathological effects of waterborne silver nanoparticles on the gills of Caspian brown trout. METHODS: In this study, 84 fish (27.46\u00b14.3 g) were tested in four concentrations of silver nanoparticles (0, 0.01, 0.02 and 0.03 mg/L) for 14 days. At the end of the experiment, gill tissue was evaluated to determine the effects of tissue damage caused by silver nanoparticles. RESULTS: Observed tissue damage included hyperplasia, hypertrophy, curvature of secondary lamellae, shortening of second lamellae, separation of epithelium from lamellae and aneurism. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that colloid silver nanoparticles in water could lead to tissue damage in the gills of Caspian brown trout, and long-term exposure to the sublethal concentrations of these nanoparticles can cause fish death.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Caspian Sea brown trout", "Chronic effect", "Gill", "Histopathology", "Silver nanoparticles"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082533868", "SubjectAreas": [["Veterinary (all)", "VETE", "3400"]], "AuthorData": {"57216038654": {"Name": "Ebrahimzadeh S.M.", "AuthorID": "57216038654", "AffiliationID": "60032053", "AffiliationName": "Department of Aquaculture, Faculty of Marine Sciences, University of Tarbiat Modares"}, "14619235700": {"Name": "Kalbassi M.R.", "AuthorID": "14619235700", "AffiliationID": "60032053", "AffiliationName": "Department of Aquaculture, Faculty of Marine Sciences, University of Tarbiat Modares"}, "57216038292": {"Name": "Anbouhi M.H.", "AuthorID": "57216038292", "AffiliationID": "60005548", "AffiliationName": "National Cell Bank of Iran, Pasteur Institute of Iran"}, "15073867400": {"Name": "Farzaneh P.", "AuthorID": "15073867400", "AffiliationID": "112246342", "AffiliationName": "Iranian Biological and Genetically Resource Center"}}}
