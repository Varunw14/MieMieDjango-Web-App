Observational studies are a valuable alternative and we outline their use in epidemiological research to study very long-term effects of lifestyle and medication on dementia, to explore (using Mendelian randomisation) the association between Alzheimer's dementia and individual traits, and to evaluate population-wide health inequalities and lifespan changes in risk factors for psychiatric illness.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Epidemiology", "mental health", "older adults"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85080893735", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57205079653": {"Name": "Shoham N.", "AuthorID": "57205079653", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60161451", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London, Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust"}, "10243664700": {"Name": "Cooper C.", "AuthorID": "10243664700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London, Islington NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
