We performed a genome-wide association study to examine rate of cognitive decline (ROD) in patients with AD. Methods: We tested for interactions between genetic variants and time since diagnosis to predict the ROD of a composite cognitive score in 3946 AD cases and performed pathway analysis on the top genes. Results: Suggestive associations (P < 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22126) were observed on chromosome 15 in DNA polymerase-\u03b3 (rs3176205, P = 1.11 \u00d7 10\u22127), chromosome 7 (rs60465337,P = 4.06 \u00d7 10\u22127) in contactin-associated protein-2, in RP11-384F7.1 on chromosome 3 (rs28853947, P = 5.93 \u00d7 10\u22127), family with sequence similarity 214 member-A on chromosome 15 (rs2899492, P = 5.94 \u00d7 10\u22127), and intergenic regions on chromosomes 16 (rs4949142, P = 4.02 \u00d7 10\u22127) and 4 (rs1304013, P = 7.73 \u00d7 10\u22127). Significant pathways involving neuronal development and function, apoptosis, memory, and inflammation were identified. Discussion: Pathways related to AD, intelligence, and neurological function determine AD progression, while previously identified AD risk variants, including the apolipoprotein (APOE) \u03b54 and \u03b52 variants, do not have a major impact.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cognitive decline", "disease progression", "genetic association", "pathway analysis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087185266", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"35104749500": {"Name": "Gross A.", "AuthorID": "35104749500", "AffiliationID": "60006183, 60005248", "AffiliationName": "Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins Center on Aging and Health"}, "57208180641": {"Name": "Mukherjee S.", "AuthorID": "57208180641", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Washington"}, "57202041242": {"Name": "Crane P.K.", "AuthorID": "57202041242", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Washington"}, "55820517700": {"Name": "Koesterer R.", "AuthorID": "55820517700", "AffiliationID": "60001001", "AffiliationName": "Programs in Metabolism and Medical & Population Genetics, Broad Institute"}, "7101751541": {"Name": "Amouyel P.", "AuthorID": "7101751541", "AffiliationID": "60104665", "AffiliationName": "DISTALZ Laboratory of Excellence (LabEx), University of Lille"}, "14017877000": {"Name": "Bellenguez C.", "AuthorID": "14017877000", "AffiliationID": "60104665", "AffiliationName": "DISTALZ Laboratory of Excellence (LabEx), University of Lille"}, "55197449600": {"Name": "Dufouil C.", "AuthorID": "55197449600", "AffiliationID": "60102125, 60116146, 60000905, 60116091, 60021564", "AffiliationName": "Inserm Unit 1219 Bordeaux Population Health, CIC 1401-EC (Clinical Epidemiology), University of Bordeaux, ISPED (Bordeaux School of Public Health), Bordeaux University Hospital"}, "55246366200": {"Name": "Bennett D.A.", "AuthorID": "55246366200", "AffiliationID": "60018691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurological Sciences, Rush University Medical Center"}, "6508199497": {"Name": "Chibnik L.", "AuthorID": "6508199497", "AffiliationID": "60001001, 60022195", "AffiliationName": "Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"}, "14831014300": {"Name": "Cruchaga C.", "AuthorID": "14831014300", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "NeuroGenomics and Informatics, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "55337551900": {"Name": "del-Aguila J.", "AuthorID": "55337551900", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "NeuroGenomics and Informatics, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "7005139839": {"Name": "Farrer L.A.", "AuthorID": "7005139839", "AffiliationID": "60006385", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine (Biomedical Genetics), Boston University School of Medicine"}, "57195753458": {"Name": "Mayeux R.", "AuthorID": "57195753458", "AffiliationID": "60011605, 60018043, 60027565", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Medical Center"}, "55228194300": {"Name": "Munsie L.", "AuthorID": "55228194300", "AffiliationID": "60025685", "AffiliationName": "Eli Lilly and Company, Lilly Corporate Center"}, "57216999233": {"Name": "Winslow A.", "AuthorID": "57216999233", "AffiliationID": "60003711, 60006297", "AffiliationName": "Orphan Disease Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania"}, "8931613700": {"Name": "Newhouse S.", "AuthorID": "8931613700", "AffiliationID": "60172638, 60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The National Institute for Health Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, University College London"}, "7006442842": {"Name": "Saykin A.J.", "AuthorID": "7006442842", "AffiliationID": "60021947", "AffiliationName": "Indiana Alzheimer Disease Center and Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences, IU Health Neuroscience Center, Indiana University School of Medicine"}, "57202623057": {"Name": "Kauwe J.S.K.", "AuthorID": "57202623057", "AffiliationID": "60006832", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Brigham Young University"}, "57203795593": {"Name": "Green R.C.", "AuthorID": "57203795593", "AffiliationID": "60028457", "AffiliationName": "Partners HealthCare Personalized Medicine"}, "57200287927": {"Name": "Sherva R.", "AuthorID": "57200287927", "AffiliationID": "60006385", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine (Biomedical Genetics), Boston University School of Medicine"}}}
