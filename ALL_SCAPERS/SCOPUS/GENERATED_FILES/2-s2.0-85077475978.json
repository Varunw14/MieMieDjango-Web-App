Participants underwent baseline assessment of plasma t-Tau and NfL concentrations as well as baseline and 24-month follow-up MRI scans. Linear models with and without influential observations (calculated using the Cook distance) were carried out to investigate the effect of plasma NfL and t-Tau concentrations, and their interaction effect with \u03b2-Amyloid status and APOE genotype, on the APC of the whole BFCS and its anterior (Ch1/2) and posterior (Ch4) subdivisions separately.ResultsHigher plasma t-Tau concentrations at baseline were associated with higher BFCS rate of atrophy (model without influencers: n = 251, F value = 4.6815; p value = 0.031). Subregional analyses showed similar results for both the APC of the Ch1/2 (model without influencers: n = 256, F value = 3.9535, p corrected = 0.047) and Ch4 BFCS sectors (model without influencers: n = 253, F value = 4.9090, p corrected = 0.047). Baseline NfL, \u03b2-Amyloid load, and APOE \u03f54 carrier status did not affect APC of the BFCS.ConclusionIncreased concentrations of baseline plasma t-Tau may predict in vivo structural BFCS atrophy progression in older adults at risk for AD, independently of \u03b2-Amyloid status and APOE genotype.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Apolipoproteins E", "Atrophy", "Biomarkers", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Neurofilament Proteins", "Parasympathetic Nervous System", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prosencephalon", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077475978", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57205131683": {"Name": "Cavedo E.", "AuthorID": "57205131683", "AffiliationID": "60015622", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital, AP-HP; Qynapse"}, "14039173800": {"Name": "Lista S.", "AuthorID": "14039173800", "AffiliationID": "60015622, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "ICM, CIC Neurosciences, APHP Department of Neurology, H\u00f4pital Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re"}, "55448106200": {"Name": "Vergallo A.", "AuthorID": "55448106200", "AffiliationID": "123924688", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Memory and Alzheimer's Disease (IM2A)"}, "7004435774": {"Name": "Teipel S.", "AuthorID": "7004435774", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}, "57208899083": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "57208899083", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7102494417": {"Name": "Potier M.C.", "AuthorID": "7102494417", "AffiliationID": "60120341, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Brain and Spine Institute (ICM), INSERM U 1127, CNRS UMR 7225"}, "7101841106": {"Name": "Dubois B.", "AuthorID": "7101841106", "AffiliationID": "123924688", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Memory and Alzheimer's Disease (IM2A)"}, "56820298200": {"Name": "Hampel H.", "AuthorID": "56820298200", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60015622, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Precision Medicine, AP-HP, Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital, Sorbonne University"}, "57194566135": {"Name": "Houot M.", "AuthorID": "57194566135", "AffiliationID": "123924132", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Excellence of Neurodegenerative Disease (CoEN)"}, "36174929100": {"Name": "Grothe M.J.", "AuthorID": "36174929100", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}, "7101909602": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "7101909602", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6603711259": {"Name": "Habert M.O.", "AuthorID": "6603711259", "AffiliationID": "60015622, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "D\u00e9partement de M\u00e9decine Nucl\u00e9aire, AP-HP, H\u00f4pital Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re"}}}
