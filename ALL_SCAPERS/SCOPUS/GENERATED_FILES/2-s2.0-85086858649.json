METHODS: We recruited 47 patients with mild (n = 20), moderate (n = 9), or severe (n = 18) COVID-19 and measured 2 plasma biomarkers of CNS injury by single molecule array, neurofilament light chain protein (NfL; a marker of intra-axonal neuronal injury) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAp; a marker of astrocytic activation/injury), in samples collected at presentation and again in a subset after a mean of 11.4 days. Cross-sectional results were compared with results from 33 age-matched controls derived from an independent cohort. RESULTS: The patients with severe COVID-19 had higher plasma concentrations of GFAp (p = 0.001) and NfL (p < 0.001) than controls, while GFAp was also increased in patients with moderate disease (p = 0.03). In patients with severe disease, an early peak in plasma GFAp decreased on follow-up (p < 0.01), while NfL showed a sustained increase from first to last follow-up (p < 0.01), perhaps reflecting a sequence of early astrocytic response and more delayed axonal injury. CONCLUSION: We show neurochemical evidence of neuronal injury and glial activation in patients with moderate and severe COVID-19. Further studies are needed to clarify the frequency and nature of COVID-19-related CNS damage and its relation to both clinically defined CNS events such as hypoxic and ischemic events and mechanisms more closely linked to systemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and consequent immune activation, as well as to evaluate the clinical utility of monitoring plasma NfL and GFAp in the management of this group of patients.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Astrocytes", "Betacoronavirus", "Biomarkers", "Case-Control Studies", "Coronavirus Infections", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neurofilament Proteins", "Neurons", "Pandemics", "Pneumonia, Viral", "Severity of Illness Index", "Single Molecule Imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086858649", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57219154865": {"Name": "Kanberg N.", "AuthorID": "57219154865", "AffiliationID": "60031699, 60019953, 60016437, 60027675, 60023691, 60000990", "AffiliationName": null}, "55498735800": {"Name": "Ashton N.J.", "AuthorID": "55498735800", "AffiliationID": "60031699, 60019953, 60016437, 60027675, 60023691, 60000990", "AffiliationName": null}, "7403059761": {"Name": "Andersson L.M.", "AuthorID": "7403059761", "AffiliationID": "60031699, 60019953, 60016437, 60027675, 60023691, 60000990", "AffiliationName": null}, "7101627980": {"Name": "Yilmaz A.", "AuthorID": "7101627980", "AffiliationID": "60031699, 60019953, 60016437, 60027675, 60023691, 60000990", "AffiliationName": null}, "7004425032": {"Name": "Lindh M.", "AuthorID": "7004425032", "AffiliationID": "60031699, 60019953, 60016437, 60027675, 60023691, 60000990", "AffiliationName": null}, "35479725000": {"Name": "Nilsson S.", "AuthorID": "35479725000", "AffiliationID": "60031699, 60019953, 60016437, 60027675, 60023691, 60000990", "AffiliationName": null}, "57213628929": {"Name": "Price R.W.", "AuthorID": "57213628929", "AffiliationID": "60031699, 60019953, 60016437, 60027675, 60023691, 60000990", "AffiliationName": null}, "7101909602": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "7101909602", "AffiliationID": "60031699, 60019953, 60016437, 60027675, 60023691, 60000990", "AffiliationName": null}, "57208899083": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "57208899083", "AffiliationID": "60031699, 60019953, 60016437, 60027675, 60023691, 60000990", "AffiliationName": null}, "57201969798": {"Name": "Gissl\u00e9n M.", "AuthorID": "57201969798", "AffiliationID": "60031699, 60019953, 60016437, 60027675, 60023691, 60000990", "AffiliationName": null}}}
