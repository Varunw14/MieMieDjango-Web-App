Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) techniques, encompassing electrospinning and electrospraying, allow the generation of fibres and particles with high surface area-to-volume ratios, versatile architectures, and highly controllable release profiles. This review is focused on exploring the potential of different EHD methods (including blend, emulsion, and co\u2212/multi-axial electrospinning and electrospraying) for the development of peptide and protein delivery systems. An overview of the principles of each technique is first presented, followed by a survey of the literature on the encapsulation of enzymes, growth factors, antibodies, hormones, and vaccine antigens using EHD approaches. The possibility for localised delivery using stimuli-responsive systems is also explored. Finally, the advantages and challenges with each EHD method are summarised, and the necessary steps for clinical translation and scaled-up production of electrospun and electrosprayed protein delivery systems are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Drug delivery", "Electrospinning", "Electrospraying", "Protein encapsulation", "Tissue engineering"], "IndexKeywords": ["Clinical translation", "Controllable release", "Electrohydrodynamic (EHD)", "Peptide and protein deliveries", "Protein delivery systems", "Protein encapsulation", "Stimuli-responsive systems", "Therapeutic strategy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095832796", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"57219868593": {"Name": "Moreira A.", "AuthorID": "57219868593", "AffiliationID": "122597165", "AffiliationName": "BIOFABICS"}, "55440244300": {"Name": "Costa P.F.", "AuthorID": "55440244300", "AffiliationID": "122597165", "AffiliationName": "BIOFABICS"}, "57219871599": {"Name": "Lawson D.", "AuthorID": "57219871599", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, Institute for Materials and Processes, The University of Edinburgh"}, "37054499800": {"Name": "Radacsi N.", "AuthorID": "37054499800", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, Institute for Materials and Processes, The University of Edinburgh"}, "57219651588": {"Name": "Onyekuru L.", "AuthorID": "57219651588", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57202535235": {"Name": "Dziemidowicz K.", "AuthorID": "57202535235", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "56473655400": {"Name": "Angkawinitwong U.", "AuthorID": "56473655400", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7406083266": {"Name": "Williams G.R.", "AuthorID": "7406083266", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}}}
