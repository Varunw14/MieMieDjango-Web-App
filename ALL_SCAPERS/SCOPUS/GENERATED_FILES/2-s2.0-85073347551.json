The present study used event-related potentials (ERPs) in two experiments to ask whether changing the overall predictive validity of the stimuli will affect comprehenders' brain responses to predictable as well as unpredictable words by manipulating the filler sentences, which made up 50% of the stimuli in each experiment. Contrary to the prediction that predictable words should be processed more easily and elicit a smaller N400 response in a more prediction-encouraging experimental context, we found that participants' N400 response to predictable as well as unpredictable words was smaller when the overall predictive validity of the stimuli was low (that is, when the filler items were incongruous compared to when they were predictable). Further, even though the use of different filler sentences did modulate comprehenders' ERP and behavioural responses, it did not modulate the effect of target word predictability on participants' ERP responses at all. We take the present findings to suggest that healthy young adults\u2019 brain responses are inherently sensitive to the predictability of the incoming linguistic stimuli, and that this robust sensitivity can be observed regardless of the make-up of the experimental stimuli.", "AuthorKeywords": ["N400", "Prediction", "Predictive validity", "Sentence processing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anticipation, Psychological", "Comprehension", "Electroencephalography", "Evoked Potentials", "Female", "Humans", "Linguistics", "Male", "Perceptual Closure", "Photic Stimulation", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Reaction Time", "Reading", "Reproducibility of Results", "Research Design", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073347551", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"56972824900": {"Name": "Zhang W.", "AuthorID": "56972824900", "AffiliationID": "60005816", "AffiliationName": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Mental Health and Cognitive Science, South China Normal University"}, "57208128424": {"Name": "Liang B.", "AuthorID": "57208128424", "AffiliationID": "60005816", "AffiliationName": "Center for the Study of Applied Psychology and School of Psychology, South China Normal University"}, "35231300500": {"Name": "Wang S.", "AuthorID": "35231300500", "AffiliationID": "60005816", "AffiliationName": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Mental Health and Cognitive Science, South China Normal University"}, "55614986500": {"Name": "Chow W.Y.", "AuthorID": "55614986500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}}}
