The study suggests that there is a wide diversity of ways of handling Master\u2019s students at a distance due to the multiplicity of factors that impinge on distance supervision, and a range of requirements in terms of the dissertation outcomes or products. The findings also suggest that in terms of the dissertation process, the course or programme leader plays a key role in dissertation supervision at a distance. The distance element means that course leaders take a more highly structured and hands-on approach to provide support for students embarking on the dissertation. The paper suggests that rather than conceptualising the supervisory process on one axis (supervisor-supervisee), we need to understand it as a complex relationship involving multiple actors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Course leadership", "Dissertation", "Distance education", "Master\u2019s", "Research education", "Supervision"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087161065", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"23006114400": {"Name": "Paran A.", "AuthorID": "23006114400", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Culture, Communication and Media, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "6603622575": {"Name": "Hyland F.", "AuthorID": "6603622575", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "English Language Education Division in the Faculty of Education, University of Hong Kong"}, "55821992300": {"Name": "Bentall C.", "AuthorID": "55821992300", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, Practice and Society, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
