Journal of Periodontal Research published by John Wiley & Sons LtdBackground and Objective: Evidence suggests that periodontitis has a negative effect on the quality of life of an individual, with increased impacts by greater disease severity. The aim of this study was to assess the association between quality of life and the presence of different severity and forms of periodontitis (aggressive and chronic), compared to a disease-free control group. Materials and Methods: Four hundred and seventy one study participants were classified according to periodontal diagnosis using the 1999 Consensus Classification into chronic periodontitis (CP), aggressive periodontitis (AgP) and periodontally healthy. Oral health-related quality of life was assessed using the OHIP-14 questionnaire. Outcomes consisted of the prevalence of oral impacts reported occasionally, fairly often or very often (OFOVO) as well as fairly often or very often (FOVO), OHIP-14 total and domain scores. Logistic and linear regression analyses were carried out to test associations between periodontal diagnosis and quality of life outcomes, adjusted for smoking, age, ethnicity and body mass index. Results: Over 90% of periodontitis patients reported at least one oral impact experienced occasionally, fairly often or very often (OFOVO) compared with 53.8% of periodontally healthy controls (P <.001). After adjustment for covariates, significant differences were found between the periodontitis groups and healthy controls for OHIP-14 outcome scores (P <.001) and across all of the OHIP-14 domains (P <.005). These differences were clinically meaningful as they were higher than the measurement errors. No significant differences were identified between AgP and CP in adjusted analysis when comparing OHIP-14 scores. Conclusion: Patients with periodontitis have worse quality of life than periodontally healthy individuals, with differences being clinically meaningful. AgP patients reported worse OHRQoL overall compared to CP patients, but these moderate and meaningful differences were explained through the adjustment process.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aggressive periodontitis", "chronic periodontitis", "periodontitis", "quality of life"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aggressive Periodontitis", "Chronic Periodontitis", "Humans", "Oral Health", "Quality of Life", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082614455", "SubjectAreas": [["Periodontics", "DENT", "3506"]], "AuthorData": {"57216123560": {"Name": "Fuller J.", "AuthorID": "57216123560", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Oral Immunobiology & Regenerative Medicine and Centre for Oral Clinical Research, Institute of Dentistry, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University London (QMUL)"}, "7004314492": {"Name": "Donos N.", "AuthorID": "7004314492", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Oral Immunobiology & Regenerative Medicine and Centre for Oral Clinical Research, Institute of Dentistry, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University London (QMUL)"}, "19637686000": {"Name": "Suvan J.", "AuthorID": "19637686000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013985", "AffiliationName": "Periodontology Unit, University College London Eastman Dental Institute"}, "57204336866": {"Name": "Tsakos G.", "AuthorID": "57204336866", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "22835642700": {"Name": "Nibali L.", "AuthorID": "22835642700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Periodontology Unit, Centre for Host Microbiome Interactions, Faculty of Dentistry, Oral & Craniofacial Sciences, King's College London"}}}
