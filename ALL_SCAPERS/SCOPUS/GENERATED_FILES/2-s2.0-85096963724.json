All rights reserved.This collective discussion forum, consisting of seven short essays, proposes some future scenarios for Estonian historical research in the next couple of decades. The Estonian historians participating in the forum represent different generations - from PhD students to emeritus professors, but they all have been or still are active in various universities across the world, mostly in Europe and in the Northern America. This means that the forum aims also to offer an external regard to the future development of historical studies in Estonia. Some of the main issues covered in the forum are the following: Estonian history needs a more comparative and trans\u00adnational perspective; interdisciplinary cooperation is still not sufficiently integrated in the historical research; historiographical and theoretical self\u00adreflection should deserve more attention; the new digital tools and digitized materials needs to be used more widely in historical studies. Topic wise, the main desiderata mentioned in the forum are the mapping of medieval sources, institutions and local populations in Livonia, the study of the 1905 revolution and its impact on Estonian indepen\u00ad dence movement, the comparative study of Soviet Estonian history, the research into regaining of the independence and rebuilding of the Estonian state in late 1980s and 1990s.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096963724", "SubjectAreas": [["History", "ARTS", "1202"]], "AuthorData": {"57204759482": {"Name": "Esse L.", "AuthorID": "57204759482", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "24469733500": {"Name": "Kasekamp A.", "AuthorID": "24469733500", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "56173064400": {"Name": "Kivim\u00e4e J.", "AuthorID": "56173064400", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "55555409500": {"Name": "Kuldkepp M.", "AuthorID": "55555409500", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "56059389500": {"Name": "K\u00f5ll A.M.", "AuthorID": "56059389500", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "55788300500": {"Name": "Nurmis K.", "AuthorID": "55788300500", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "56167211600": {"Name": "Toomaspoeg K.", "AuthorID": "56167211600", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
