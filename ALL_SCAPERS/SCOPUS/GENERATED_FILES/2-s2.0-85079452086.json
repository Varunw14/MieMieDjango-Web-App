We exploit three unique features of the 2012 administration of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), a large-scale, low-stakes international assessment. During the 2012 PISA administration, participating students were asked to sit two separate tests consisting of problem-solving tasks. Both tests included questions that covered the same internationally recognized and validated framework for mathematics assessment. Students were randomly assigned in the first, 2-h-long test to one of three test versions containing varying amounts of mathematics, reading, and science problems. We found that the amount of mathematics problems in the first test had a small positive effect on mean mathematics performance on the second test, but no effect on general reasoning and problem-solving ability. Subject-specific effects of test practice on subsequent test performance were found over both short lags (same day) and medium lags (1\u20137 days). The learning gains ascribed to mathematics problem-solving practice were larger for boys than for girls.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Large-scale international assessments", "Mathematics", "Problem solving", "Retrieval practice", "Testing"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079452086", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"37002672600": {"Name": "Avvisati F.", "AuthorID": "37002672600", "AffiliationID": "60009357", "AffiliationName": "Directorate for Education and Skills, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development"}, "35613910500": {"Name": "Borgonovi F.", "AuthorID": "35613910500", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Science, Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
