KGaA, WeinheimAs a new class of sustainable carbon material, \u201ccarbon dots\u201d is an umbrella term covering many types of materials. Herein, a broad range of techniques was used to develop the understanding of hydrothermally synthesized carbon dots, and it is shown how fine-tuning the structural features by simple reduction/oxidation reactions can drastically affect their excited-state properties. Structural and spectroscopic studies found that photoluminescence originates from direct excitation of localized fluorophores involving oxygen functional groups, whereas excitation at graphene-like features leads to ultrafast phonon-assisted relaxation and largely quenches the fluorescent quantum yields. This is arguably the first study to identify the dynamics of photoluminescence including Stokes shift and allow the relaxation pathways in these carbon dots to be fully resolved. This comprehensive investigation sheds light on how understanding the excited-state relaxation processes in different carbon structures is crucial for tuning the optical properties for any potential commercial applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["carbon", "carbon dots", "fluorescence", "hydrothermal synthesis", "nanoparticles"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carbon dots", "Commercial applications", "Excited state relaxation", "Excited-state properties", "Hydrothermally synthesized", "Oxygen functional groups", "Reduction/oxidation", "Spectroscopic studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072091627", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"]], "AuthorData": {"57211182999": {"Name": "Luo H.", "AuthorID": "57211182999", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57210972953": {"Name": "Feng J.", "AuthorID": "57210972953", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "6506809216": {"Name": "Titirici M.M.", "AuthorID": "6506809216", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57207988832": {"Name": "Yang Y.", "AuthorID": "57207988832", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "56179771700": {"Name": "Belen Jorge A.", "AuthorID": "56179771700", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "24821388000": {"Name": "Dimitrov S.D.", "AuthorID": "24821388000", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "SPECIFIC IKC, College of Engineering, Swansea University"}, "57201734008": {"Name": "Papaioannou N.", "AuthorID": "57201734008", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, Queen Mary University of London"}, "55612362100": {"Name": "Sun Y.", "AuthorID": "55612362100", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, Queen Mary University of London"}, "6701807715": {"Name": "Sapelkin A.", "AuthorID": "6701807715", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, Queen Mary University of London"}, "23478249600": {"Name": "Salvadori E.", "AuthorID": "23478249600", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Turin"}, "35750574100": {"Name": "Roessler M.M.", "AuthorID": "35750574100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Molecular Sciences Research Hub, Imperial College London, White City Campus"}, "57210972964": {"Name": "Ploenes G.", "AuthorID": "57210972964", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Magnetic Resonance Research Center, Institute for Molecules and Materials, Radboud University"}, "6701439700": {"Name": "van Eck E.R.H.", "AuthorID": "6701439700", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Magnetic Resonance Research Center, Institute for Molecules and Materials, Radboud University"}, "55890584100": {"Name": "Tanase L.C.", "AuthorID": "55890584100", "AffiliationID": "60078585", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Materials Physics"}, "24558735600": {"Name": "Danaie M.", "AuthorID": "24558735600", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd., Electron Physical Science Imaging Centre"}, "57207806454": {"Name": "Durrant J.", "AuthorID": "57207806454", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Centre for Plastic Electronics, Imperial College London"}}}
