Methods: Here, we report the results of HR (diffuse anaplastic [DA] or blastemal type [BT]) stage IV WT treated patients according to the HR arm in the SIOP2001 prospective study. Results: From January 2002 to August 2014, 3559 patients with WT were included in the SIOP2001 trial. Among the 525 patients (15%) with metastatic WT, 74 (14%) had stage IV HR-WT. The median age at diagnosis was 5.5 years (range: 1.4\u201318.3). Thirty-four patients (47%) had BT-WT and 40 (53%) had DA-WT. Five-year event-free survival rates were 44 \u00b1 17% and 28 \u00b1 15% for BT-WT and DA-WT, respectively (p = 0.09). Five-year overall survival rates were 53 \u00b1 17% and 29 \u00b1 16% for BT-WT and DA-WT, respectively (p = 0.03). Metastatic complete response after preoperative treatment was significantly associated with outcome in univariate and multivariate analyses (hazards ratio = 0.3; p = 0.01). Postoperative radiotherapy of metastatic sites might also be beneficial. Forty-three of 74 patients experienced a relapse or progression predominantly in the lungs (80%). The median time to relapse/progression after diagnosis was 7.3 months (range: 1.6\u201333.3) and 4.9 months (range: 0.7\u201328.4) for BT-WT and DA-WT, respectively (p = 0.67). This is the first prospective evidence of inferior survival of stage IV BT-WT as compared with historical intermediate-risk WT. Survival of patients with stage IV DA-WT has not improved compared to the previous SIOP93-01 study. Conclusion: These results call for new treatment approaches for patients with HR stage IV WT.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anaplasia", "Blastema", "Cancer", "Child", "TP53", "Wilms"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Dactinomycin", "Disease Progression", "Disease-Free Survival", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Kidney Neoplasms", "Male", "Neoplasm Recurrence, Local", "Neoplasm Staging", "Prospective Studies", "Survival Rate", "Time Factors", "Vincristine", "Wilms Tumor"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079007109", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"56006392000": {"Name": "Pasqualini C.", "AuthorID": "56006392000", "AffiliationID": "120389373", "AffiliationName": "Children and Adolescents Oncology Department"}, "11140318300": {"Name": "Furtw\u00e4ngler R.", "AuthorID": "11140318300", "AffiliationID": "60023686", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Haematology/Oncology, Saarland University Hospital"}, "34975072100": {"Name": "Graf N.", "AuthorID": "34975072100", "AffiliationID": "60023686", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Haematology/Oncology, Saarland University Hospital"}, "56266131400": {"Name": "van Tinteren H.", "AuthorID": "56266131400", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Biometrics Department, Netherlands Cancer Institute"}, "7005911482": {"Name": "Teixeira R.A.P.", "AuthorID": "7005911482", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Do Tratamento Do C\u00e2ncer Infantil, Department of Pediatrics, S\u00e3o Paulo University"}, "6506533418": {"Name": "Acha T.", "AuthorID": "6506533418", "AffiliationID": "60004717", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Materno-Infantil \u201cCarlos Haya\u201d, Department of Pediatrics"}, "57208541060": {"Name": "Howell L.", "AuthorID": "57208541060", "AffiliationID": "60024857", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005591155": {"Name": "Vujanic G.", "AuthorID": "7005591155", "AffiliationID": "60107609", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology"}, "6602192341": {"Name": "Godzinski J.", "AuthorID": "6602192341", "AffiliationID": "60007108", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Traumatology and Emergency Medicine, Medical University"}, "54682206000": {"Name": "Melchior P.", "AuthorID": "54682206000", "AffiliationID": "60023686", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Saarland University Hospital"}, "7004678927": {"Name": "Smets A.M.", "AuthorID": "7004678927", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Academic Medical Center"}, "6602254537": {"Name": "Coulomb-L'Hermine A.", "AuthorID": "6602254537", "AffiliationID": "60013700", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Hospital D'Enfants Armand Trousseau"}, "8785326400": {"Name": "Brisse H.", "AuthorID": "8785326400", "AffiliationID": "60030640", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Curie Institut"}, "7005535741": {"Name": "Pritchard-Jones K.", "AuthorID": "7005535741", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7102206707": {"Name": "Bergeron C.", "AuthorID": "7102206707", "AffiliationID": "60018084", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Onco-Haematology Department, Centre Leon Berard"}, "7004176152": {"Name": "de Camargo B.", "AuthorID": "7004176152", "AffiliationID": "60014878", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Nacional Do Cancer, Pediatric Onco-Haematology"}, "6602159710": {"Name": "van den Heuvel-Eibrink M.M.", "AuthorID": "6602159710", "AffiliationID": "112710862", "AffiliationName": "Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague"}, "6701737879": {"Name": "Verschuur A.C.", "AuthorID": "6701737879", "AffiliationID": "60024144, 60004797", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Onco-Haematology Department, Hopital de La Timone, AP-HM"}}}
