Anorectal manometry (ARM) and high-resolution anorectal manometry (HRAM) are relatively novel tools for the assessment of anal sphincter function and rectal sensation and have contributed significantly to improving the understanding of the anorectum as a functional unit. ARM has been recognized as the investigation of choice for adults with symptoms of defecation disorders, including fecal incontinence (FI), evacuation difficulties, and constipation. Although it is the gold standard tool in adults, it has yet to be formally accepted as a standardized diagnostic tool in the pediatric age, with limited knowledge regarding indications, protocol, and normal values. ARM/HRAM is slowly becoming recognized among pediatricians, but given that there are currently no agreed guidelines there is a risk that will lead to diversity in practice. The British Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (BSPGHAN)\u2014Motility Working Group (MWG) therefore has taken the opportunity to provide guidance on the use of ARM/HRAM in children with CC and/or FI.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anal sphincter", "anorectal function", "faecal incontinence", "high -resolution anorectal manometry", "paediatric chronic constipation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078791554", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Endocrine and Autonomic Systems", "NEUR", "2807"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"24329320100": {"Name": "Athanasakos E.", "AuthorID": "24329320100", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Surgery, Royal London Hospital"}, "12243320900": {"Name": "Cleeve S.", "AuthorID": "12243320900", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Surgery, Royal London Hospital"}, "8337607800": {"Name": "Thapar N.", "AuthorID": "8337607800", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health Library"}, "7003568688": {"Name": "Lindley K.", "AuthorID": "7003568688", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Division of Paediatric Neurogastroenterology and Motility, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust"}, "57214468921": {"Name": "Cronin H.", "AuthorID": "57214468921", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Division of Paediatric Neurogastroenterology and Motility, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust"}, "6602467294": {"Name": "Borrelli O.", "AuthorID": "6602467294", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Division of Paediatric Neurogastroenterology and Motility, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust"}, "57217937691": {"Name": "Perring S.", "AuthorID": "57217937691", "AffiliationID": "60026868", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics, Poole Hospital NHS Trust"}, "56425911800": {"Name": "Mutalib M.", "AuthorID": "56425911800", "AffiliationID": "60107269", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Gastroenterology, Evelina London Children's Hospital"}}}
