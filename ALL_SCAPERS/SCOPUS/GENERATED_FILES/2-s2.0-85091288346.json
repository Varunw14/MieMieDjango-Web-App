Despite considerable recent advances within acute ischemic stroke treatment, scope remains for development of widely applicable neuroprotective agents. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), originally licensed for the management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, have demonstrated pre-clinical neuroprotective efficacy in a range of neurodegenerative conditions. This systematic scoping review reports the pre-clinical basis of GLP-1RAs as neuroprotective agents in acute ischemic stroke and their translation into clinical trials. We included 35 pre-clinical studies, 11 retrospective database studies, 7 cardiovascular outcome trials and 4 prospective clinical studies. Pre-clinical neuroprotection was demonstrated in normoglycemic models when administration was delayed by up to 24 h following stroke induction. Outcomes included reduced infarct volume, apoptosis, oxidative stress and inflammation alongside increased neurogenesis, angiogenesis and cerebral blood flow. Improved neurological function and a trend towards increased survival were also reported. Cardiovascular outcomes trials reported a significant reduction in stroke incidence with semaglutide and dulaglutide. Retrospective database studies show a trend towards neuroprotection. Prospective interventional clinical trials are on-going, but initial indicators of safety and tolerability are favourable. Ultimately, we propose that repurposing GLP-1RAs is potentially advantageous but appropriately designed trials are needed to determine clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acute stroke", "animal models", "clinical trials", "neuroprotection", "reperfusion"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091288346", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57191760091": {"Name": "Maskery M.P.", "AuthorID": "57191760091", "AffiliationID": "60010985", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Royal Preston Hospital"}, "57210067647": {"Name": "Emsley H.C.A.", "AuthorID": "57210067647", "AffiliationID": "60010985", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Royal Preston Hospital"}, "55172440800": {"Name": "Holscher C.", "AuthorID": "55172440800", "AffiliationID": "60073731", "AffiliationName": "Research and Experimental Center, Henan University of Chinese Medicine"}, "55819996200": {"Name": "Jones S.P.", "AuthorID": "55819996200", "AffiliationID": "60031259", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Wellbeing, University of Central Lancashire"}, "57203921779": {"Name": "Watkins C.L.", "AuthorID": "57203921779", "AffiliationID": "60031259", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Wellbeing, University of Central Lancashire"}, "7403076948": {"Name": "Price C.I.", "AuthorID": "7403076948", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience, Stroke Research Group, Newcastle University"}, "9244119500": {"Name": "Strain W.D.", "AuthorID": "9244119500", "AffiliationID": "60111707, 60006326", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Exeter Clinical Research Facility and Institute of Biomedical and Clinical Science, University of Exeter Medical School, Royal Devon Exeter NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603707621": {"Name": "Werring D.J.", "AuthorID": "6603707621", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Research Centre, Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Institute of Neurology, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
