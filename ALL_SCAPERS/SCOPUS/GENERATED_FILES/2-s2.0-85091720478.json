Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Antiretroviral therapy (ART) increases the risk of cardiometabolic diseases in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). However, there is a lack of evidence regarding the effectiveness of a nutritional intervention on several cardiometabolic parameters in this population. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of two nutritional interventions on several cardiometabolic parameters in PLWHA treated with ART. A parallel randomized clinical trial was performed with PLWHA treated with ART. The participants (n = 88) were divided into two intervention groups: (1) nutritional counseling (n = 44) and (2) individualized dietary prescription (n = 44). The follow-up period was 30 weeks. A reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was the primary outcome. Secondary outcome variables were reductions in total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP and DBP, respectively), waist circumference (WC), body mass index (BMI), and increases in high-density lipoproteins (HDL). A multiple linear regression was used to analyze the effectiveness of the interventions, adjusted for sociodemographic, lifestyle, and clinical characteristics. Sixty-two PLWHA completed the trial (nutritional counseling, n = 32; individualized dietary prescription, n = 30). At follow-up, we observed in the nutritional counseling group significant reductions in SBP (p = 0.036) and DBP (p = 0.001). Significant reductions in FPG (p = 0.008) and DBP (p = 0.023) were found in the individualized dietary prescription group. In the fully adjusted models, significant reductions in LDL, SBP, DBP, and BMI were found in the individualized dietary prescription group. In conclusion, the two investigated nutritional interventions were effective in reducing some cardiometabolic risk factors in PLWHA. However, after adjustments for covariates, the individualized dietary prescription showed significant reductions in the primary outcome and, also, in more cardiometabolic risk factors than the nutritional counseling.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AIDS", "Antiretroviral therapy", "Cardiometabolic risk factors", "Dietary intervention", "Dyslipidemia", "HIV", "Individualized dietary prescription", "Nutritional counseling"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091720478", "SubjectAreas": [["Food Science", "AGRI", "1106"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"47860980900": {"Name": "Silveira E.A.", "AuthorID": "47860980900", "AffiliationID": "60027136", "AffiliationName": "Postgraduate Program in Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Federal University of Goi\u00e1s"}, "7102223177": {"Name": "de Oliveira C.", "AuthorID": "7102223177", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology & Public Health, Institute of Epidemiology & Health Care, University College London"}, "55925227900": {"Name": "Falco M.O.", "AuthorID": "55925227900", "AffiliationID": "60027136", "AffiliationName": "Postgraduate Program in Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Federal University of Goi\u00e1s"}, "57188823819": {"Name": "Santos A.S.e.A.d.C.", "AuthorID": "57188823819", "AffiliationID": "60027136", "AffiliationName": "Postgraduate Program in Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Federal University of Goi\u00e1s"}, "54684623500": {"Name": "Noll M.", "AuthorID": "54684623500", "AffiliationID": "60101675", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Federal Goiano, Public Health"}}}
