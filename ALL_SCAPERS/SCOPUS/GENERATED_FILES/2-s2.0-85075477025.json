Here, we report the use of fast low-dose pink-beam synchrotron X-ray tomography in combination with mechanical loading at nanometric precision for in situ imaging, at resolutions below 100 nm, of the mechanical strain in intact untreated joints under physiologically realistic conditions. We show that in young, older and osteoarthritic mice, hierarchical changes in tissue structure and mechanical behaviour can be simultaneously visualized, and that the tissue structure at the cellular level correlates with the mechanical performance of the whole joint. We also use the tomographic approach to study the colocalization of tissue strains to specific chondrocyte lacunar organizations within intact loaded joints and to explore the role of calcified-cartilage stiffness on the biomechanics of healthy and pathological joints.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Hierarchical structures", "In-situ characterization", "Mechanical behaviour", "Mechanical loading", "Mechanical performance", "Mechanical strain", "Realistic conditions", "Synchrotron X-ray tomography", "Animals", "Chondrocytes", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Joints", "Male", "Mice", "Nanostructures", "Osteoarthritis", "Stress, Mechanical", "Synchrotrons", "Tomography, X-Ray"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075477025", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"23988852700": {"Name": "Madi K.", "AuthorID": "23988852700", "AffiliationID": "122564828", "AffiliationName": "3Dmagination Ltd, Harwell Oxford"}, "57189219743": {"Name": "Geng H.", "AuthorID": "57189219743", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, The University of Manchester"}, "8504683300": {"Name": "Lee P.D.", "AuthorID": "8504683300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "54685042900": {"Name": "Staines K.A.", "AuthorID": "54685042900", "AffiliationID": "60018186", "AffiliationName": "School of Applied Sciences, Edinburgh Napier University"}, "7004973326": {"Name": "Bay B.K.", "AuthorID": "7004973326", "AffiliationID": "60013402", "AffiliationName": "School of Mechanical, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Oregon State University"}, "26025973600": {"Name": "Javaheri B.", "AuthorID": "26025973600", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Comparative Biomedical Sciences, Royal Veterinary College"}, "57206490569": {"Name": "Pitsillides A.A.", "AuthorID": "57206490569", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Comparative Biomedical Sciences, Royal Veterinary College"}, "6602075256": {"Name": "Cartmell S.", "AuthorID": "6602075256", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, The University of Manchester"}, "57064238500": {"Name": "Bodey A.J.", "AuthorID": "57064238500", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}}}
