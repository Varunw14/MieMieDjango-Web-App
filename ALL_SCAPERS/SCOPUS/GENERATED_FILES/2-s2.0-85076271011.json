All rights reserved.Gene therapy offers the potential for a cure for patients with hemophilia by establishing continuous endogenous expression of factor VIII or factor IX (FIX) following transfer of a functional gene to replace the hemophilic patient's own defective gene. The hemophilias are ideally suited for gene therapy because a small increment in blood factor levels (\u20215% of normal) is associated with significant amelioration of bleeding phenotype in severely affected patients. In 2011, the St. Jude/UCL phase 1/2 trial was the first to provide clear evidence of a stable dose-dependent increase in FIX levels in patients with severe hemophilia B following a single administration of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors. Transgenic FIX expression has remained stable at ~5% of normal in the high-dose cohort over a 7-year follow-up period, resulting in a substantial reduction in spontaneous bleeding and FIX protein usage without toxicity. This study has been followed by unparalleled advances in gene therapy for hemophilia A and B, leading to clotting factor activity approaching normal or near-normal levels associated with a \u201czero bleed rates\u201d in previously severely affected patients following a single administration of AAV vectors. Thus, AAV gene therapies are likely to alter the treatment paradigm for hemophilia A and B. This review explores recent progress and the remaining limitations that need to be overcome for wider availability of this novel treatment of inherited bleeding disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Gene Transfer Techniques", "Genetic Therapy", "Genetic Vectors", "Hemophilia A", "Humans"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076271011", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"6603785385": {"Name": "Nathwani A.C.", "AuthorID": "6603785385", "AffiliationID": "60112465", "AffiliationName": "Freeline Therapeutics Ltd."}}}
