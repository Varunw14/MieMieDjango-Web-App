All rights reserved.The hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels are voltage-gated ion channels that critically modulate neuronal activity. Four HCN subunits (HCN1-4) have been cloned, each having a unique expression profile and distinctive effects on neuronal excitability within the brain. Consistent with this, the expression and function of these subunits are altered in diverse ways in neurological disorders. Here, we review current knowledge on the structure and distribution of the individual HCN channel isoforms, their effects on neuronal activity under physiological conditions, and how their expression and function are altered in neurological disorders, particularly epilepsy, neuropathic pain, and affective disorders. We discuss the suitability of HCN channels as therapeutic targets and how drugs might be strategically designed to specifically act on particular isoforms. We conclude that medicines that target individual HCN isoforms and/or their auxiliary subunit, TRIP8b, may provide valuable means of treating distinct neurological conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["drug design", "HCN", "ion channels", "neurological disease", "therapeutic"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Drug Design", "Humans", "Hyperpolarization-Activated Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Channels", "Nervous System Diseases", "Neurons", "Protein Isoforms", "Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077693290", "SubjectAreas": [["Toxicology", "PHAR", "3005"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"6603838739": {"Name": "Santoro B.", "AuthorID": "6603838739", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University"}, "7402047550": {"Name": "Shah M.M.", "AuthorID": "7402047550", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, University College London"}}}
