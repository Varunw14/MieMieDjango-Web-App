It examined 41 indicators across five broad domains: climate change impacts, exposures and vulnerability; adaptation, planning and resilience for health; mitigation actions and health co-benefits; economics and finance; and public and political engagement. It found that, overall, Australia is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change on health, and that policy inaction in this regard threatens Australian lives. In this report we present the 2019 update. We track progress on health and climate change in Australia across the same five broad domains and many of the same indicators as in 2018. A number of new indicators are introduced this year, including one focused on wildfire exposure, and another on engagement in health and climate change in the corporate sector. Several of the previously reported indicators are not included this year, either due to their discontinuation by the parent project, the Lancet Countdown, or because insufficient new data were available for us to meaningfully provide an update to the indicator. In a year marked by an Australian federal election in which climate change featured prominently, we find mixed progress on health and climate change in this country. There has been progress in renewable energy generation, including substantial employment increases in this sector. There has also been some progress at state and local government level. However, there continues to be no engagement on health and climate change in the Australian federal Parliament, and Australia performs poorly across many of the indicators in comparison to other developed countries; for example, it is one of the world's largest net exporters of coal and its electricity generation from low carbon sources is low. We also find significantly increasing exposure of Australians to heatwaves and, in most states and territories, continuing elevated suicide rates at higher temperatures. We conclude that Australia remains at significant risk of declines in health due to climate change, and that substantial and sustained national action is urgently required in order to prevent this.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Climate change", "Health communication", "Health financing", "Health policy", "Morbidity", "Mortality", "Population health", "Risk management"], "IndexKeywords": ["Australia", "Climate Change", "Economics", "Environmental Exposure", "Environmental Policy", "Extreme Hot Weather", "Federal Government", "Health", "Health Planning", "Health Policy", "Healthcare Financing", "Humans", "Local Government", "Mosquito Vectors", "Politics", "Renewable Energy", "State Government", "Vector Borne Diseases", "Wildfires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075204361", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"6603587569": {"Name": "Beggs P.J.", "AuthorID": "6603587569", "AffiliationID": "60019544", "AffiliationName": "Macquarie University"}, "34768782000": {"Name": "Linnenluecke M.K.", "AuthorID": "34768782000", "AffiliationID": "60019544", "AffiliationName": "Macquarie University"}, "6507607114": {"Name": "Trueck S.", "AuthorID": "6507607114", "AffiliationID": "60019544", "AffiliationName": "Macquarie University"}, "55739776200": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "55739776200", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "University of Sydney"}, "9747755400": {"Name": "Berry H.L.", "AuthorID": "9747755400", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "University of Sydney"}, "35274547900": {"Name": "Boylan S.M.", "AuthorID": "35274547900", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "University of Sydney"}, "21934126200": {"Name": "Hanigan I.C.", "AuthorID": "21934126200", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "University of Sydney"}, "56112637000": {"Name": "Malik A.", "AuthorID": "56112637000", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "University of Sydney"}, "57211236569": {"Name": "Capon A.G.", "AuthorID": "57211236569", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "University of Sydney"}, "6505763105": {"Name": "Bambrick H.", "AuthorID": "6505763105", "AffiliationID": "60011019", "AffiliationName": "Queensland University of Technology"}, "57202072544": {"Name": "Bi P.", "AuthorID": "57202072544", "AffiliationID": "60009512", "AffiliationName": "University of Adelaide"}, "7404386355": {"Name": "Green D.", "AuthorID": "7404386355", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "Climate Change Research Centre, UNSW"}, "57208982698": {"Name": "Perkins-Kirkpatrick S.", "AuthorID": "57208982698", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "Climate Change Research Centre, UNSW"}, "55712472800": {"Name": "Guo Y.", "AuthorID": "55712472800", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Monash University"}, "7101845773": {"Name": "Johnston F.H.", "AuthorID": "7101845773", "AffiliationID": "60027621, 60015356", "AffiliationName": "Menzies Institute for Medical Research, University of Tasmania"}, "57201851366": {"Name": "Madden D.L.", "AuthorID": "57201851366", "AffiliationID": "60031487", "AffiliationName": "University of Notre Dame Australia"}, "7402037863": {"Name": "Morgan G.G.", "AuthorID": "7402037863", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "University Centre for Rural Health, University of Sydney"}, "56146876000": {"Name": "Rychetnik L.", "AuthorID": "56146876000", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Menzies Centre for Health Policy, University of Sydney"}, "7201804246": {"Name": "Stevenson M.", "AuthorID": "7201804246", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "University of Melbourne"}, "56027021800": {"Name": "Watts N.", "AuthorID": "56027021800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Global Health, University College London"}}}
