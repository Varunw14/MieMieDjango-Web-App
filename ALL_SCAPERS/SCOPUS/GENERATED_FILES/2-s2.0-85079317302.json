A revision of the main topics which may impact DSP design will be discussed through application examples. Modulation formats, KK receivers, and coherent receivers are analyzed at light of the DSP enabled receivers' impact. Also, relevant are FEC and burst mode which are debated at the light of PON requirements. Simplified analog coherent receivers are presented as a use case to serve as simplification path for non-DSP high performance receivers. On the other end, aiming at discussing current PON limits, an ultra dense wavelength division multiplexing (UDWDM) use case is also presented where several advanced topics like pulse shaping, high density, and simplified DSP operations are considered.", "AuthorKeywords": ["burst mode", "coherent", "DMT", "DSP", "FEC", "KK", "PON", "quasi coherent", "UDWDM"], "IndexKeywords": ["Application examples", "Burst mode", "coherent", "Coherent receivers", "Modulation formats", "quasi coherent", "UDWDM", "Ultradense wavelength division multiplexing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079317302", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"15756526900": {"Name": "Teixeira A.", "AuthorID": "15756526900", "AffiliationID": "60024825, 60017375", "AffiliationName": "Optical Communications Group, Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es and DETI/Universidade de Aveiro"}, "57110068500": {"Name": "Lavery D.", "AuthorID": "57110068500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College of London (UCL)"}, "7004149082": {"Name": "Ciaramella E.", "AuthorID": "7004149082", "AffiliationID": "60028039", "AffiliationName": "Optical Group, Scuola Superiore sant'Anna"}, "24315127300": {"Name": "Schmalen L.", "AuthorID": "24315127300", "AffiliationID": "60102538", "AffiliationName": "Communications Engineering Lab (CEL), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)"}, "24776287800": {"Name": "Iiyama N.", "AuthorID": "24776287800", "AffiliationID": "60025555", "AffiliationName": "Optical Access, NTT Corporation"}, "55858142000": {"Name": "Ferreira R.M.", "AuthorID": "55858142000", "AffiliationID": "123877650", "AffiliationName": "Firmware, PICadvanced"}, "6601905987": {"Name": "Randel S.", "AuthorID": "6601905987", "AffiliationID": "60102538", "AffiliationName": "Communications Engineering Lab (CEL), KIT (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology)"}}}
