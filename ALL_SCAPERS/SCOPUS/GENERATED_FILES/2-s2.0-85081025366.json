However, the fretting biocorrosion is the main concern that limited its successfully application in orthopaedic application. In this study, a structure optimised thin TiO2 nanotube (SONT) layer was successfully created on Ti6Al4V bone screw, and its fretting corrosion performance was investigated and compared to the pristine Ti6Al4V bone screws and NT decorated screw in a bone-screw fretting simulation rig. The results have shown that the debonding TiO2 nanotube from the bone screw reduced significantly, as a result of structure optimisation. The SONT layer also exhibited enhanced bio-corrosion resistance compared pristine bone screw and conventionally NT modified bone screw. It is postulated that interfacial layer between TiO2 nanotube and Ti6Al4V substrate, generated during structure optimisation process, enhanced bonding of TiO2 nanotube layer to the Ti6Al4V bone screws that leading to the improvement in fretting corrosion resistance. The results highlighted the potential SONT in orthopaedic application as bone fracture fixation devices.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomedical materials", "Bone implant interface", "Bone screws", "Fretting corrosion", "TiO2 nanotubes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bone screw", "Bone-fracture fixation", "Bone-implant interfaces", "Corrosion performance", "Interfacial layer", "Orthopaedic applications", "Structure optimisation", "TiO2 nanotubes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081025366", "SubjectAreas": [["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Polymers and Plastics", "MATE", "2507"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57208166343": {"Name": "Luo J.", "AuthorID": "57208166343", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedic & Musculoskeletal Science, Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "55581409800": {"Name": "Tamaddon M.", "AuthorID": "55581409800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedic & Musculoskeletal Science, Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "57188879979": {"Name": "Liu C.", "AuthorID": "57188879979", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedic & Musculoskeletal Science, Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "57190166082": {"Name": "Yan C.", "AuthorID": "57190166082", "AffiliationID": "60011549, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Solid Lubrication, Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "55926446200": {"Name": "Ma S.", "AuthorID": "55926446200", "AffiliationID": "60011549, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Solid Lubrication, Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "56072753100": {"Name": "Wang X.", "AuthorID": "56072753100", "AffiliationID": "60011549, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Solid Lubrication, Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "55630030200": {"Name": "Zhou F.", "AuthorID": "55630030200", "AffiliationID": "60011549, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Solid Lubrication, Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}}}
