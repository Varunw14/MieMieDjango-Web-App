These solutions allow the execution of sophisticated per-packet monitoring using the processing power available on servers. Although advances in packet capture have enabled the interception of packets at high rates, bottlenecks can still arise in the monitoring process as a result of concurrent access to shared processor resources, variations of the traffic skew, and unbalanced packet-rate spikes. In this paper we present an adaptive monitoring framework, MONA, which is resilient to bottlenecks while maintaining the accuracy of monitoring reports above a user-specified threshold. MONA dynamically reduces the measurement task sets under adverse conditions, and reconfigures them to recover potential accuracy degradations. To quantify the monitoring accuracy at run time, MONA adopts a novel task-independent technique that generates accuracy estimates according to recently observed traffic characteristics. With a prototype implementation based on a generic packet-processing pipeline, and using well-known measurements tasks, we show that MONA achieves lossless traffic monitoring for a wide range of conditions, significantly enhances the level of monitoring accuracy, and performs adaptations at the time scale of milliseconds with limited overhead.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dynamic resource allocation", "Network monitoring", "software packet processing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptive monitoring", "Commodity hardware", "Monitoring accuracy", "Monitoring process", "Processor resources", "Prototype implementations", "Traffic characteristics", "Traffic monitoring"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087547500", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57190031604": {"Name": "Tangari G.", "AuthorID": "57190031604", "AffiliationID": "60019544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computing, Macquarie University"}, "14010012200": {"Name": "Charalambides M.", "AuthorID": "14010012200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003707235": {"Name": "Pavlou G.", "AuthorID": "7003707235", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "36184239500": {"Name": "Tuncer D.", "AuthorID": "36184239500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computing, Imperial College London"}}}
