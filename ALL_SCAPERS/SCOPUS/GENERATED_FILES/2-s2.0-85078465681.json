Despite the historical frequency of this claim, there is little direct evidence assessing this \u2018emboldenment\u2019 hypothesis. This paper develops a novel test of this argument during the US counterinsurgency campaign following the invasion of Iraq in 2003. We find that following spikes in US domestic debate over the Iraq war, there is no evidence that insurgent attacks on military or civilian targets increased in regions of Iraq with greater access to US news compared to regions with less access. Overall, these results offer no support for the emboldenment claim.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Democracy", "insurgency", "resolve"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078465681", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"16042915800": {"Name": "Monten J.", "AuthorID": "16042915800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Political Science, University College London"}, "57214220893": {"Name": "Iyengar Plumb R.", "AuthorID": "57214220893", "AffiliationID": "60003873", "AffiliationName": "RAND Corporation"}}}
