Sporadic observations from rare cloud-free satellite images\u2014and even rarer in situ reports\u2014provide glimpses into a dynamic arc system characterised by persistent gas emissions and frequent eruptive activity. Our understanding of the state of volcanic activity along this arc is incomplete compared to arcs globally. To fill this gap, we present here detailed geological and volcanological observations made during an expedition to the South Sandwich Islands in January 2020. We report the first in situ measurements of gas chemistry, emission rate and carbon isotope composition from along the arc. We show that Mt. Michael on Saunders Island is a persistent source of gas emissions, releasing 145 \u00b1 59 t day\u22121 SO2 in a plume characterised by a CO2/SO2 molar ratio of 1.8 \u00b1 0.2. Combining this CO2/SO2 ratio with our independent SO2 emission rate measured near simultaneously, we derive a CO2 flux of 179 \u00b1 76 t day\u22121. Outgassing from low temperature (90\u2013100 \u00b0C) fumaroles is pervasive at the active centres of Candlemas and Bellingshausen, with measured gas compositions indicative of interaction between magmatic fluids and hydrothermal systems. Carbon isotope measurements of dilute plume and fumarole gases from along the arc indicate a magmatic \u03b413C of \u2212 4.5 \u00b1 2.0\u2030. Interpreted most simply, this result suggests a carbon source dominated by mantle-derived carbon. However, based on a carbon mass balance from sediment core ODP 701, we show that mixing between depleted upper mantle and a subduction component composed of sediment and altered crust is also permissible. We conclude that, although remote, the South Sandwich Volcanic Arc is an ideal tectonic setting in which to explore geochemical processes in a young, developing arc.", "AuthorKeywords": ["South Sandwich Volcanic Arc", "Volcanic activity", "Volcanic gas emissions"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85097510245", "SubjectAreas": [["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"56340637000": {"Name": "Liu E.J.", "AuthorID": "56340637000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "57193869135": {"Name": "Wood K.", "AuthorID": "57193869135", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Aerospace Engineering, University of Bristol"}, "6604089965": {"Name": "Aiuppa A.", "AuthorID": "6604089965", "AffiliationID": "60017697", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra e del Mare, Universit\u00e0 di Palermo"}, "56931154600": {"Name": "Bitetto M.", "AuthorID": "56931154600", "AffiliationID": "60017697", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra e del Mare, Universit\u00e0 di Palermo"}, "16309345800": {"Name": "Giudice G.", "AuthorID": "16309345800", "AffiliationID": "60000243", "AffiliationName": "Sezione di Catania, INGV"}, "7402051549": {"Name": "Fischer T.P.", "AuthorID": "7402051549", "AffiliationID": "60033021", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, University of New Mexico"}, "57219770538": {"Name": "McCormick Kilbride B.T.", "AuthorID": "57219770538", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "6701688672": {"Name": "Plank T.", "AuthorID": "6701688672", "AffiliationID": "60033011, 60030162", "AffiliationName": "Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University"}, "25521692600": {"Name": "Hart T.", "AuthorID": "25521692600", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Zoology, University of Oxford"}}}
