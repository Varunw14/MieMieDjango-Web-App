The rocks in this structure are dominated by subarkose and sublitharenite sandstones. The authigenic minerals formed after CO2 injection are dawsonite, microcrystalline quartz, kaolinite and ankerite. Dawsonite and ankerite are formed just beneath a CO2 bearing anticlinal structure due to the reactions between silicate minerals (feldspars and clay minerals) and the fluid phase. Carbon and oxygen isotopic analyses indicate that the main carbon source for dawsonite and ankerite formation was mantle magmatic CO2. The aqueous activities of sodium and calcium, the partial pressure of CO2, pH and temperature are the key factors influencing the stability of the dawsonite and ankerite. The presence of the anticlinal structure, maintaining a locally high CO2 partial pressure in the waters beneath this structure, is likely responsible for the observed long-term persistence of dawsonite and ankerite in this system.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Authigenic carbonate minerals", "Carbon and oxygen isotopes", "Carbon capture and storage (CCS)", "Dawsonite stability", "Yinggehai basin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anticlinal structure", "Authigenic minerals", "Carbon mineralization", "Natural analog", "Oxygen isotopic", "Sandstone aquifer", "South China sea", "Yinggehai basin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088664241", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"55488230100": {"Name": "Yu L.", "AuthorID": "55488230100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "56647095900": {"Name": "Liu L.", "AuthorID": "56647095900", "AffiliationID": "60007711", "AffiliationName": "College of Earth Sciences, Jilin University"}, "56661588700": {"Name": "Liu N.", "AuthorID": "56661588700", "AffiliationID": "60007711", "AffiliationName": "College of Earth Sciences, Jilin University"}, "57195018773": {"Name": "Oelkers E.H.", "AuthorID": "57195018773", "AffiliationID": "60102124", "AffiliationName": "GET-Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse-CNRS-IRD-OMP"}, "49161420000": {"Name": "Wu K.", "AuthorID": "49161420000", "AffiliationID": "60082196", "AffiliationName": "China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) Research Institute"}, "57195347319": {"Name": "Ming X.", "AuthorID": "57195347319", "AffiliationID": "60003725", "AffiliationName": "The First Monitoring and Application Center"}}}
