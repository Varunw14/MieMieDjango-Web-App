Collagen is the main component of the ECM and its metabolism could act as a useful indicator of ECM disruption. We have measured the specific collagen breakdown products; urinary free hydroxylated (Lys-OH) and glycosylated hydroxylysines (Lys-O-Gal and Lys-O-GalGlc) in MPS patients using a tandem liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assay. A pilot study cohort analysis indicated that concentrations of lysine and Lys-OH were raised significantly in MPS I (Hurler) disease patients. Lys-O-GalGlc was raised in MPS II and MPS VI patients and demonstrated a significant difference between MPS I Hurler and an MPS I Hurler-Scheie group. Further analysis determined an age association for glycosylated hydroxylysine in control samples similar to that observed for the glycosaminoglycans. Using defined age ranges and treatment na\u00efve patient samples we confirmed an increase in glycosylated hydroxylysines in MPS I and in adult MPS IVA. We also looked at the ratio of Lys-O-Gal to Lys-O-GalGlc, an indicator of the source of collagen degradation, and noticed a significant change in the ratio for all pediatric MPS I, II, and IV patients, and a small significant increase in adult MPS IV. This indicated that the collagen degradation products were coming from a source other than bone such as cartilage or connective tissue. To see how specific the changes in glycosylated hydroxylysine were to MPS patients we also looked at levels in patients with other inherited metabolic disorders. MPS patients showed a trend towards increased glycosylated hydroxylysines and an elevated ratio compared to other metabolic disorders that included Battens disease, Fabry disease, Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (due to mutations in ALDH7A1), and Niemann Pick C disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biomarker", "collagen", "glycosylated hydroxylysine", "Mucopolysaccharidoses"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073949138", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"57005987700": {"Name": "Patel N.", "AuthorID": "57005987700", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Great Ormond Street Biomedical Research Centre, Great Ormond Street Hospital and UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57202556029": {"Name": "Mills P.", "AuthorID": "57202556029", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Inborn Errors of Metabolism Section, Genetics & Genomic Medicine Unit, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "6602308059": {"Name": "Gissen P.", "AuthorID": "6602308059", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "57202309963": {"Name": "Doykov I.", "AuthorID": "57202309963", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Inborn Errors of Metabolism Section, Genetics & Genomic Medicine Unit, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7202875406": {"Name": "Mills K.", "AuthorID": "7202875406", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Inborn Errors of Metabolism Section, Genetics & Genomic Medicine Unit, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "56458521200": {"Name": "Heywood W.E.", "AuthorID": "56458521200", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Great Ormond Street Biomedical Research Centre, Great Ormond Street Hospital and UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "36503791000": {"Name": "Davison J.", "AuthorID": "36503791000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Great Ormond Street Biomedical Research Centre, Great Ormond Street Hospital and UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7202006123": {"Name": "Cleary M.", "AuthorID": "7202006123", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Great Ormond Street Biomedical Research Centre, Great Ormond Street Hospital and UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57211441251": {"Name": "Dorman M.", "AuthorID": "57211441251", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Great Ormond Street Biomedical Research Centre, Great Ormond Street Hospital and UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "55326420400": {"Name": "Banushi B.", "AuthorID": "55326420400", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Metabolic Medicine Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
