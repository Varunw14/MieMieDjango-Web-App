Although a network-based structure can better capture the micro-level variation of spatio-temporal events, existing deep learning methods of sparse events forecasting are either based on area or grid units due to the data sparsity in both space and time, and the complex network topology. To overcome these challenges, this paper develops the first deep learning (DL) model for network-based predictive mapping of sparse spatio-temporal events. Leveraging a graph-based representation of the network-structured data, a gated localised diffusion network (GLDNet) is introduced, which integrating a gated network to model the temporal propagation and a novel localised diffusion network to model the spatial propagation confined by the network topology. To deal with the sparsity issue, we reformulate the research problem as an imbalance regression task and employ a weighted loss function to train the DL model. The framework is validated on a crime forecasting case of South Chicago, USA, which outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmark by 12% and 25% in terms of the mean hit rate at 10% and 20% coverage level, respectively.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deep learning", "Graph", "Network", "Predictive hotspot mapping", "Sparse spatio-temporal data"], "IndexKeywords": ["Graph", "Graph-based representations", "Hot spot", "Spatial propagation", "Spatio-temporal data", "Spatio-temporal events", "Temporal propagation", "Weighted loss function"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075365385", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Ecological Modeling", "ENVI", "2302"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"57196203282": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "57196203282", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "SpaceTimeLab for Big Data Analytics, Department of Civil, Environmental & Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "35200522100": {"Name": "Cheng T.", "AuthorID": "35200522100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "SpaceTimeLab for Big Data Analytics, Department of Civil, Environmental & Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
