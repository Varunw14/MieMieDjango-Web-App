Published by BMJ.Objectives We aimed to develop a digital intervention to support antidepressant discontinuation in UK primary care that is scalable, accessible, safe and feasible. In this paper, we describe the development using a theory, evidence and person-based approach. Design Intervention development using a theory, evidence and person-based approach. Setting Primary Care in the South of England. Participants Fifteen participants with a range of antidepressant experience took part in think aloud' interviews for intervention optimisation. Intervention Our digital intervention prototype (called ADvisor') was developed on the basis of a planning phase consisting of qualitative and quantitative reviews, an in-depth qualitative study, the development of guiding principles and a theory-based behavioural analysis. Our optimisation phase consisted of think aloud' interviews where the intervention was iteratively refined. Results The qualitative systematic review and in-depth qualitative study highlighted the centrality of fear of depression relapse as a key barrier to discontinuation. The quantitative systematic review showed that psychologically informed approaches such as cognitive-behavioural therapy were associated with greater rates of discontinuation than simple advice to reduce. Following a behavioural diagnosis based on the behaviour change wheel, social cognitive theory provided a theoretical basis for the intervention. The intervention was optimised on the basis of think aloud interviews, where participants suggested they like the flexibility of the system and found it reassuring. Changes were made to the tone of the material and the structure was adjusted based on this qualitative feedback. Conclusions ADvisor' is a theory, evidence and person-based digital intervention designed to support antidepressant discontinuation. The intervention was perceived as helpful and reassuring in optimisation interviews. Trials are now needed to determine the feasibility, clinical and cost-effectiveness of this approach.", "AuthorKeywords": ["antidepressants", "depression & mood disorders", "digital intervention", "intervention development", "primary care"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081543563", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"56992892800": {"Name": "Bowers H.M.", "AuthorID": "56992892800", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care, Population Sciences and Medical Education, University of Southampton"}, "55987142200": {"Name": "Kendrick T.", "AuthorID": "55987142200", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care, Population Sciences and Medical Education, University of Southampton"}, "57193810916": {"Name": "Williams S.", "AuthorID": "57193810916", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care, Population Sciences and Medical Education, University of Southampton"}, "6602558835": {"Name": "Leydon G.", "AuthorID": "6602558835", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care, Population Sciences and Medical Education, University of Southampton"}, "57215657420": {"Name": "Laine R.", "AuthorID": "57215657420", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care, Population Sciences and Medical Education, University of Southampton"}, "10244613900": {"Name": "Geraghty A.W.A.", "AuthorID": "10244613900", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care, Population Sciences and Medical Education, University of Southampton"}, "57215660222": {"Name": "Glowacka M.", "AuthorID": "57215660222", "AffiliationID": "60029336", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Social Sciences, Bournemouth University"}, "7201679264": {"Name": "May C.", "AuthorID": "7201679264", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "56360697900": {"Name": "Dowrick C.", "AuthorID": "56360697900", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Population Health Sciences, University of Liverpool"}, "57207838002": {"Name": "Moncrieff J.", "AuthorID": "57207838002", "AffiliationID": "60107401, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Sciences, University College London and North East London Mental Health Trust"}, "15840190300": {"Name": "Nestoriuc Y.", "AuthorID": "15840190300", "AffiliationID": "124058792", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Helmet Schmidt University"}, "7202645907": {"Name": "Andersson G.", "AuthorID": "7202645907", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience and Psychiatry, Karolinska Institutet"}}}
