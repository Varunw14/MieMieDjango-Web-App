All rights reserved.Purpose of reviewThe use of MRI in the early detection of prostate cancer (PCa) is increasing rapidly. In the last couple of years, there have been a number of key publications that have led to its adoption in the UK and European guidelines.Recent findingsPROMIS showed that standard biopsy missed up to half of clinically significant disease, compared with 5mm template mapping biopsy. Three studies then compared the standard transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) pathway with an MRI with or without targeted biopsy pathway. These showed that MRI-targeted biopsies detect more clinically significant disease and reduce overdetection of indolent disease whilst allowing between one-third to one half of men to avoid an immediate biopsy. Cost-effectiveness data show that using MRI to determine who gets a biopsy and how that biopsy is done is a cost-neutral approach when men at lowest risk do not undergo biopsy.SummaryProstate MRI is a useful and cost-effective tool for early detection of PCa that minimizes the impact of overdetection and overtreatment whilst maximizing the detection of PCa, which could benefit from treatment. The next challenge is to ensure that centres offering MRI are able to offer high-quality MRI acquisition and reporting.", "AuthorKeywords": ["early detection", "MRI", "prostate cancer", "risk prediction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Early Detection of Cancer", "Humans", "Image-Guided Biopsy", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Prostate-Specific Antigen", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "Ultrasound, High-Intensity Focused, Transrectal"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071474972", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"55646665800": {"Name": "Giganti F.", "AuthorID": "55646665800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London, Charles Bell House"}, "7402982572": {"Name": "Moore C.M.", "AuthorID": "7402982572", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital, NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
