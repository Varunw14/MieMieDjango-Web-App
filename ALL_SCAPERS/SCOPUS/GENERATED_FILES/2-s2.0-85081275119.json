However, their nano architecture and micro mechanical properties had not been fully characterized. Here, using electron microscopy, \u00b5-CT, atomic force microscopy and finite element simulation, an in-depth characterization of osteoderms from the lizard Heloderma suspectum, is presented. Results show that osteoderms are made of three different mineralized regions: a dense apex, a fibre-enforced region comprising the majority of the osteoderm, and a bone-like region surrounding the vasculature. The dense apex is stiff, the fibre-enforced region is flexible and the mechanical properties of the bone-like region fall somewhere between the other two regions. Our finite element analyses suggest that when combined into the osteoderm structure, the distinct tissue regions are able to shield the body of the animal by bearing the external forces. These findings reveal the structure-function relationship of the Heloderma suspectum osteoderm in unprecedented detail. Statement of Significance: The structures of bone and teeth have been thoroughly investigated. They provide a basis not only for understanding the mechanical properties and functions of these hard tissues, but also for the de novo design of composite materials. Osteoderms, however, are hard tissues that must possess mechanical properties distinct from teeth and bone to function as a protective armour. Here we provide a detailed analysis of the nanostructure of vertebrate osteoderms from Heloderma suspectum, and show that their mechanical properties are determined by their multiscale hierarchical tissue. We believe this study contributes to advance the current knowledge of the structure-function relationship of the hierarchical structures in the Heloderma suspectum osteoderm. This knowledge might in turn provide a source of inspiration for the design of bioinspired and biomimetic materials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Armour plates", "Biomineralizations", "Bones", "Lizards", "Osteoderms"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081275119", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"56901064000": {"Name": "Iacoviello F.", "AuthorID": "56901064000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.J.L.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.R.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57203840892": {"Name": "Kirby A.C.", "AuthorID": "57203840892", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57195576312": {"Name": "Tsolaki E.", "AuthorID": "57195576312", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004072469": {"Name": "Olivo A.", "AuthorID": "7004072469", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "35323732000": {"Name": "Bertazzo S.", "AuthorID": "35323732000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "56685592500": {"Name": "Javanmardi Y.", "AuthorID": "56685592500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "24554512000": {"Name": "Moeendarbary E.", "AuthorID": "24554512000", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "57215587659": {"Name": "Shabanli M.", "AuthorID": "57215587659", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "24173602100": {"Name": "Moazen M.", "AuthorID": "24173602100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "56727720800": {"Name": "Sharp A.C.", "AuthorID": "56727720800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "57203513332": {"Name": "Evans S.E.", "AuthorID": "57203513332", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "57215578814": {"Name": "Hayes M.J.", "AuthorID": "57215578814", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "56426539200": {"Name": "Keevend K.", "AuthorID": "56426539200", "AffiliationID": "60020086", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Meet Life, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, (Empa)"}, "57215588988": {"Name": "Li J.H.", "AuthorID": "57215588988", "AffiliationID": "60020086", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Meet Life, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, (Empa)"}, "28367653500": {"Name": "Herrmann I.K.", "AuthorID": "28367653500", "AffiliationID": "60020086", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Meet Life, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, (Empa)"}}}
