This research has been conducted within the context of a wider research program investigating the use of data dashboard technologies and open data to more effectively communicate information to urban authorities and citizens and enable more evidence-based decision making. These technologies have drawn criticism for promoting objectifying, data-driven approaches to urban governance that have proven insensitive to the specificity of place and the contexts of citizens\u2019 daily lives. Within the digital and spatial humanities, there has been growing interest in \u2018deep mapping\u2019 as a means for recovering the sense of place and the nuances of everyday life through the incorporation of spatial narratives and multimedia in their mapping practices. This paper considers the ways in which mixed realities can contribute to these efforts, and in particular the unique affordances of virtual reality for evoking an embodied sense of presence that contributes to the communication of a sense of place via rich multisensory experiences. The paper concludes with the discussion of a pilot study conducted with members of the public. This demonstrates the ways in which virtual environments can be created in ways that maintain contextual and affective links to the places they represent as a result of involvement in \u2018hands-on\u2019 activity of mapping through urban sensing and the capture of place-based media.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Community engagement", "Deep mapping", "Mixed reality", "Space & place", "Urban sensing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Data-driven approach", "Digital contents", "Evidence- based decisions", "Multi-Modal Interactions", "Research programs", "Sense of presences", "Spatial narratives", "Urban governance"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089166732", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57210961604": {"Name": "Dawkins O.", "AuthorID": "57210961604", "AffiliationID": "60026281", "AffiliationName": "MUSSI, Maynooth University, Co."}, "57191269453": {"Name": "Young G.W.", "AuthorID": "57191269453", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "V-SENSE, Trinity College Dublin, Co."}}}
