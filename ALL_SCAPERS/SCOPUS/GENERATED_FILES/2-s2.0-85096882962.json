The reporting of noise complaints is carried out in England as a part of environment legislation, providing data for government decision-making. The relationships between noise complaints, a part of urban conflicts, and socio-economic spatial inequalities are significant. This study explores the relationships between noise complaints and socio-economic factors at the city/region level. The noise complaints and socio-economic datasets from the government's open source data provide input for statistical analysis across all districts and unitary local authorities in England. The results suggest that the impacts of socio-economic factors \u2013 including demographic, job-related, property, and deprivation aspects \u2013 on noise complaints are generally significant. In addition, cities/regions with a higher proportion of young and single residents tend to have more noise complaints, as do cities/regions with diverse ethnicities and religions. High-density cities/regions with higher unemployment rates are likely to receive more noise complaints. More deprived cities/regions are also prone to an increased noise complaint rate.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Demographic factor", "Deprivation factor", "Job-related factor", "Noise complaint", "Property factor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Environmental noise", "Government decisions", "High-density cities", "Local authorities", "Open source datum", "Socio-economic factor", "Unemployment rates", "Urban sustainable development"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096882962", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"]], "AuthorData": {"57219049530": {"Name": "Tong H.", "AuthorID": "57219049530", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Env.
