The 'Perfusion Pressure Cerebral Infarcts' (PPCI) trial randomized patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and/or aortic valve replacement to a MAP of 40-50 or 70-80 mmHg during CPB and found no difference in clinical or imaging outcomes between the groups. We here present PPCI trial predefined secondary end points, consisting of biomarkers of brain injury. METHODS: Blood was collected from PPCI trial patients at baseline, 24 and 48 h after induction of anaesthesia and at discharge from the surgical ward. Blood was analysed for neuron-specific enolase, tau, neurofilament light and the glial marker glial fibrillary acidic protein. Linear mixed models were used to analyse differences in biomarker value changes from baseline between the 2 MAP allocation groups. RESULTS: A total of 193 (98%) patients were included. We found no differences in biomarker levels over time from baseline to discharge between the 2 MAP allocation groups (PNSE = 0.14, PTau = 0.46, PNFL = 0.21, PGFAP = 0.13) and the result did not change after adjustment for age, sex and type of surgery. CONCLUSIONS: We found no significant differences in levels of biomarkers of neurological injury in patients undergoing elective or subacute CABG and/or aortic valve replacement randomized to either a target MAP of 40-50 mmHg or a target MAP of 70-80 mmHg during CBP.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aortic valve replacement", "Biomarkers", "Coronary artery bypass grafting", "Neurological injury"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85100359318", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"56488061600": {"Name": "Wiberg S.", "AuthorID": "56488061600", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "57210224079": {"Name": "Kjaergaard J.", "AuthorID": "57210224079", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "7005846737": {"Name": "Hassager C.", "AuthorID": "7005846737", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Copenhagen"}, "57189345985": {"Name": "Holmgaard F.", "AuthorID": "57189345985", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiothoracic Anesthesia, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "7401810625": {"Name": "Nilsson J.C.", "AuthorID": "7401810625", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiothoracic Anesthesia, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "6701341908": {"Name": "Wanscher M.", "AuthorID": "6701341908", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiothoracic Anesthesia, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "55652967000": {"Name": "Vedel A.G.", "AuthorID": "55652967000", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiothoracic Anesthesia, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL"}, "6701443883": {"Name": "Langkilde A.R.", "AuthorID": "6701443883", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "7201874483": {"Name": "Rasmussen L.S.", "AuthorID": "7201874483", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesia, Center of Head and Orthopedics, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}}}
