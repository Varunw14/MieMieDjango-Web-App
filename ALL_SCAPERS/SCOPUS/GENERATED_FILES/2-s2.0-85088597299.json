The Authors.Temporal changes in the subsurface seismic velocity structure reflect the physical processes that modulate the properties of the media through which seismic waves propagate. These processes, such as healing of the surface damage zone and deep crustal deformation, are described by similar functional forms and operate on similar timescales, making it difficult to determine which process drives the observed changes. We examine earthquake-induced velocity changes using the measured lag-time time series \u03c4(t) of the repeating earthquake sequences since the 2004 Mw 9.2 Sumatra and 2005 Mw 8.6 Nias earthquakes. The S coda velocity changes (\u03b4VS, equivalent to \u2212\u03c4S) recover steadily during the 2005\u20132015 period. The Rayleigh wave velocity changes (\u03b4VLR, or \u2212\u03c4LR) undergo transient recovery, followed by a strong \u03b4VLR reduction in late 2007. \u03b4VS recovery is most likely driven by deep processes, whereas the temporal breaks in \u03b4VLR recovery in 2007 mostly reflect surface damage and healing induced by the strong ground motions of the 2004 Mw 9.2, 2005 Mw 8.6, 2007 Mw 8.4, and Mw 7.9 Bengkulu and 2008 Mw 7.3 Simeulue earthquakes. The observed differences between the temporal variations in \u03b4VS and \u03b4VLR can distinguish deep processes from healing of the surface damage zone.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088597299", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"8643568300": {"Name": "Yu W.", "AuthorID": "8643568300", "AffiliationID": "60011081", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica"}, "57196347644": {"Name": "Su J.", "AuthorID": "57196347644", "AffiliationID": "60011081", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica"}, "57211297436": {"Name": "Lin J.T.", "AuthorID": "57211297436", "AffiliationID": "60012317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University of Oregon"}, "7202363863": {"Name": "Song T.R.A.", "AuthorID": "7202363863", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "57218279399": {"Name": "Kang C.C.", "AuthorID": "57218279399", "AffiliationID": "122406304", "AffiliationName": "Department of Natural Sciences and Sustainable Development, Ministry of Science and Technology"}}}
