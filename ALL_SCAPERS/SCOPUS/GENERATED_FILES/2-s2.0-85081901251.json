A recent rise in early death was observed in the United States. We investigated the impact of low cardiorespiratory fitness during young and middle adulthood on premature death in healthy adults from recent generations. Methods: A prospective cohort study of a nationally representative sample of US Baby Boomers and Generation Xers (born 1945-1980). Between 1999 and 2004, 3242 adults ages 20 to 49 years (weighted N = 59,888,450; mean age, 33.8 \u00b1 0.2 years) underwent submaximal treadmill exercise test in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey study. Weighted Cox proportional hazards regression were used to evaluate the association of cardiorespiratory fitness with premature death at 65 years or younger. Results: During a mean follow-up of 13.8 years, 104 deaths (weighted deaths N =1,326,808) occurred. Low cardiorespiratory fitness was associated with an increased risk of premature death as a result of all-cause (hazard ratio [HR], low vs high: 2.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10 to 4.64, P for trend = 0.036) and cancer mortality (HR low vs moderate/high: 6.53; 95% CI, 2.38 to 17.9). Further, this association was stronger in adults ages 35 to 49 years at baseline (HR, 4.17 [95% CI, 1.19 to 9.11]). Conclusion: We observed an inverse association between cardiorespiratory fitness during middle adulthood and premature death, which was not detected in preceding generations. These findings suggested that low cardiorespiratory fitness might be emerging as a new risk factor for early death among US Baby Boomers and Generation Xers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Baby Boomers", "Cardiorespiratory fitness", "Early death", "Generation Xers", "Middle-aged adults", "Young adults"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "African Americans", "Cardiorespiratory Fitness", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Cause of Death", "Cohort Studies", "European Continental Ancestry Group", "Exercise", "Exercise Test", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Hispanic Americans", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mortality, Premature", "Neoplasms", "Oxygen Consumption", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Prospective Studies", "Smoking", "United States", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081901251", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57205476718": {"Name": "Cao C.", "AuthorID": "57205476718", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Division of Public Health Sciences, Department of Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "7003968389": {"Name": "Cade W.T.", "AuthorID": "7003968389", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Program in Physical Therapy and Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "6603921261": {"Name": "Racette S.B.", "AuthorID": "6603921261", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Program in Physical Therapy and Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "9939659000": {"Name": "Park Y.", "AuthorID": "9939659000", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "55270204400": {"Name": "Cao Y.", "AuthorID": "55270204400", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "57189045362": {"Name": "Yang L.", "AuthorID": "57189045362", "AffiliationID": "60000953, 60002306", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Oncology and Community Health Sciences, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary"}, "7004933140": {"Name": "Friedenreich C.M.", "AuthorID": "7004933140", "AffiliationID": "60000953, 60002306", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Oncology and Community Health Sciences, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary"}, "8502496600": {"Name": "Hamer M.", "AuthorID": "8502496600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London"}, "55847987800": {"Name": "Stamatakis E.", "AuthorID": "55847987800", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Charles Perkins Centre and Prevention Research Collaboration, Sydney School of Public Health, The University of Sydney"}, "37117793800": {"Name": "Smith L.", "AuthorID": "37117793800", "AffiliationID": "60000913", "AffiliationName": "The Cambridge Centre for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Anglia Ruskin University"}}}
