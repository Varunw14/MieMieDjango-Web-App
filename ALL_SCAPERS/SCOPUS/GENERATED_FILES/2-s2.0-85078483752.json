Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.This article interrogates a tension at the heart of the principle of accountability: accountability as a principle of non-impunity of public officials versus accountability as a form of bureaucratic organisation and control. Although these dimensions are distinguishable in the abstract, their ambiguity has led to an expectations gap among both citizens and elites. The historical legacies of previous policies can exacerbate this expectations gap, leading to a variety of value trade-offs, with the potential to undermine other political values, such as political learning, consensus-building, and citizens' rights. We present examples of the trade-offs resulting from this expectations gap, focusing on moments of crisis in which such trade-offs can be seen most acutely, and highlight its role as a vehicle of global populism.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078483752", "SubjectAreas": [["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"57214218477": {"Name": "Hilliard N.", "AuthorID": "57214218477", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "26037471300": {"Name": "Kovras I.", "AuthorID": "26037471300", "AffiliationID": "60071343, 60025704", "AffiliationName": "City University London and University of Cyprus"}, "6504607017": {"Name": "Loizides N.", "AuthorID": "6504607017", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "University of Kent"}}}
