Blood plasma represents an attractive source of biomarkers. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are conserved noncoding RNA molecules that serve as posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression. As opposed to ubiquitously expressed miRNAs that control house-keeping processes, brain-enriched miRNAs regulate diverse aspects of neuron development and function. These include neuron-subtype specification, axonal growth, dendritic morphogenesis, and spine density. Backed by a large number of studies, we now know that the differential expression of neuron-enriched miRNAs leads to brain dysfunction. Objectives: The aim was to identify subsets of brain-enriched miRNAs with diagnostic potential for familial and idiopathic PD as well as specify the molecular pathways deregulated in PD. Methods: Initially, brain-enriched miRNAs were selected based on literature review and validation studies in human tissues. Subsequently, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed in the plasma of 100 healthy controls and 99 idiopathic and 53 genetic (26 alpha-synucleinA53T and 27 glucocerebrosidase) patients. Statistical and bioinformatics analyses were carried out to pinpoint the diagnostic biomarkers and deregulated pathways, respectively. Results: An explicit molecular fingerprint for each of the 3 PD cohorts was generated. Although the idiopathic PD fingerprint was different from that of genetic PD, the molecular pathways deregulated converged between all PD subtypes. Conclusions: The study provides a group of brain-enriched miRNAs that may be used for the detection and differentiation of PD subtypes. It has also identified the molecular pathways deregulated in PD. \u00a9 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biomarkers", "GBA", "microRNA", "Parkinson's disease", "SNCA"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076207690", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56480701800": {"Name": "Ravanidis S.", "AuthorID": "56480701800", "AffiliationID": "60003185", "AffiliationName": "Center of Basic Research, Biomedical Research Foundation, Academy of Athens"}, "6506657817": {"Name": "Doxakis E.", "AuthorID": "6506657817", "AffiliationID": "60003185", "AffiliationName": "Center of Basic Research, Biomedical Research Foundation, Academy of Athens"}, "55629725400": {"Name": "Bougea A.", "AuthorID": "55629725400", "AffiliationID": "60007844, 60028900", "AffiliationName": "1st Department of Neurology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Medical School, Eginition Hospital, Athens"}, "57188849793": {"Name": "Papagiannakis N.", "AuthorID": "57188849793", "AffiliationID": "60007844, 60028900", "AffiliationName": "1st Department of Neurology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Medical School, Eginition Hospital, Athens"}, "12790281200": {"Name": "Maniati M.", "AuthorID": "12790281200", "AffiliationID": "60003185", "AffiliationName": "Center of Clinical Research, Experimental Surgery and Translational Research, Biomedical Research Foundation, Academy of Athens"}, "57202963715": {"Name": "Stefanis L.", "AuthorID": "57202963715", "AffiliationID": "60007844, 60028900", "AffiliationName": "1st Department of Neurology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Medical School, Eginition Hospital, Athens"}, "15834998200": {"Name": "Koros C.", "AuthorID": "15834998200", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "2nd Department of Neurology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Medical School"}, "56575103000": {"Name": "Simitsi A.M.", "AuthorID": "56575103000", "AffiliationID": "60007844, 60028900", "AffiliationName": "1st Department of Neurology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Medical School, Eginition Hospital, Athens"}, "57212211366": {"Name": "Pachi I.", "AuthorID": "57212211366", "AffiliationID": "60007844, 60028900", "AffiliationName": "1st Department of Neurology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Medical School, Eginition Hospital, Athens"}, "57208560010": {"Name": "Stamelou M.", "AuthorID": "57208560010", "AffiliationID": "60029813", "AffiliationName": "Parkinson's disease and Movement disorders department, HYGEIA Hospital"}, "6701365777": {"Name": "Paraskevas G.P.", "AuthorID": "6701365777", "AffiliationID": "60007844, 60028900", "AffiliationName": "1st Department of Neurology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Medical School, Eginition Hospital, Athens"}, "6701539777": {"Name": "Kapaki E.", "AuthorID": "6701539777", "AffiliationID": "60007844, 60028900", "AffiliationName": "1st Department of Neurology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Medical School, Eginition Hospital, Athens"}, "6507557970": {"Name": "Bozi M.", "AuthorID": "6507557970", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "2nd Department of Neurology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Medical School"}, "6603497576": {"Name": "Moraitou M.", "AuthorID": "6603497576", "AffiliationID": "108938507", "AffiliationName": "Department of Enzymology and Cellular Function, Institute of Child Health"}, "7003963499": {"Name": "Michelakakis H.", "AuthorID": "7003963499", "AffiliationID": "108938507", "AffiliationName": "Department of Enzymology and Cellular Function, Institute of Child Health"}}}
