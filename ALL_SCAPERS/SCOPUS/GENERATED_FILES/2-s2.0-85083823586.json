However, to date, there are no available data on adherence to adjunct noninsulin medications in this population. Our aim was to assess adherence to ACE inhibitors and statins and explore potential determinants in adolescents with type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS There were 443 adolescents with type 1 diabetes recruited into the Adolescent Type 1 Diabetes Cardio-Renal Intervention Trial (AdDIT) and exposed to treatment with two oral drugsdan ACE inhibitor and a statindas well as combinations of both or placebo for 2\u20134 years. Adherence was assessed every 3 months with the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) and pill count. RESULTS Median adherence during the trial was 80.2% (interquartile range 63.6\u201391.8) based on MEMS and 85.7% (72.4\u201392.9) for pill count. Adherence based on MEMS and pill count dropped from 92.9% and 96.3%, respectively, at the first visit to 76.3% and 79.0% at the end of the trial. The percentage of study participants with adherence \u226575% declined from 84% to 53%. A good correlation was found between adherence based on MEMS and pill count (r 5 0.82, P < 0.001). Factors associated with adherence were age, glycemic control, and country. CONCLUSIONS We report an overall good adherence to ACE inhibitors and statins during a clinical trial, although there was a clear decline in adherence over time. Older age and suboptimal glycemic control at baseline predicted lower adherence during the trial, and, predictably, reduced adherence was more prevalent in subjects who subsequently dropped out.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083823586", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Advanced and Specialized Nursing", "NURS", "2902"]], "AuthorData": {"55519786600": {"Name": "Niechcia\u0142 E.", "AuthorID": "55519786600", "AffiliationID": "60069010", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Diabetes, Endocrinology and Obesity, Poznan University of Medical Sciences"}, "6701333811": {"Name": "Acerini C.L.", "AuthorID": "6701333811", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, University of Cambridge"}, "57216541127": {"Name": "Stevens T.", "AuthorID": "57216541127", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, University of Cambridge"}, "56908198700": {"Name": "Dunger D.B.", "AuthorID": "56908198700", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60015879, 60120909, 60022106", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust, Medical Research Council Institute of Metabolic Science, University of Cambridge"}, "9243301200": {"Name": "Marcovecchio M.L.", "AuthorID": "9243301200", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, University of Cambridge"}, "56190407900": {"Name": "Chiesa S.T.", "AuthorID": "56190407900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "7004333788": {"Name": "Deanfield J.E.", "AuthorID": "7004333788", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "57193257034": {"Name": "Neil Dalton R.", "AuthorID": "57193257034", "AffiliationID": "60107269, 60005518", "AffiliationName": "Evelina Children\u2019s Hospital, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 National Health Service Foundation Trust"}, "16136328200": {"Name": "Daneman D.", "AuthorID": "16136328200", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto"}, "13807128900": {"Name": "Mahmud F.H.", "AuthorID": "13807128900", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto"}, "35315843900": {"Name": "Jones T.W.", "AuthorID": "35315843900", "AffiliationID": "60000096, 60031806", "AffiliationName": "Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia"}, "7401823584": {"Name": "Marshall S.M.", "AuthorID": "7401823584", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "InstituteofCellularMedicine(Diabetes), Faculty of Clinical Medical Sciences, Newcastle University"}, "57204643806": {"Name": "Neil A.H.W.", "AuthorID": "57204643806", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Centre for Diabetes, Endocrinology & Metabolism, University of Oxford"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
