However, such systems could be constrained by high power source degradation and energy costs. Cost-effective energy management strategies are essential for such hybrid systems to mitigate the high costs. This article presents a Double Q reinforcement learning based energy management system for such systems to achieve near-optimal average voyage cost. The Double Q agent is trained using stochastic power profiles collected from continuous monitoring of a passenger ferry, using a plug-in hybrid fuel cell and battery propulsion system model. The energy management strategies generated by the agent were validated using another test dataset collected over a different period. The proposed methodology provides a novel approach to optimal use hybrid fuel cell and battery propulsion systems for ships. The results show that without prior knowledge of future power demands, the strategies can achieve near-optimal cost performance (96.9%) compared to those derived from using dynamic programming with the equivalent state space resolution.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coastal ferry", "Continuous monitoring", "Energy management system", "Hybrid fuel cell and battery", "Reinforcement learning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Charging infrastructures", "Continuous monitoring", "Emission performance", "Energy management strategies", "Equivalent state", "High-power source", "Passenger ferries", "Propulsion system"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086838454", "SubjectAreas": [["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"57205727945": {"Name": "Wu P.", "AuthorID": "57205727945", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Marine Research Group, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "57190974668": {"Name": "Partridge J.", "AuthorID": "57190974668", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Marine Research Group, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005111389": {"Name": "Bucknall R.", "AuthorID": "7005111389", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Marine Research Group, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
