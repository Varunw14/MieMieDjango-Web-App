However, biocontrol agents are often non-native species and require significant infrastructure; overuse of single agents results in pest resistance. Native biocontrol agents are urgently required for more sustainable multi-faceted approaches to pest management. Social wasps are natural predators of lepidopteran pests, yet their viability as native biocontrol agents is largely unknown. Here, we provide evidence that the social paper wasp Polistes satan is a successful predator on the larvae of two economically important and resilient crop pests, the sugarcane borer Diatraea saccharalis (on sugarcane Saccharum spp.) and the fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda (on maize Zea mays); P. satan wasps significantly reduce crop pest damage. These results provide the much-needed baseline experimental evidence that social wasps have untapped potential as native biocontrol agents for sustainable crop production and food security.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biocontrol", "Diatraea saccharalis", "Integrated pest management", "Paper wasps", "Polistes satan", "Spodoptera frugiperda"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Behavior, Animal", "Hemolysin Proteins", "Moths", "Pest Control, Biological", "Social Behavior", "Wasps"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074625963", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"56584629700": {"Name": "Southon R.J.", "AuthorID": "56584629700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biodiversity and Environmental Research, Department of Genetics Evolution and Environment, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "7005759495": {"Name": "Sumner S.", "AuthorID": "7005759495", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biodiversity and Environmental Research, Department of Genetics Evolution and Environment, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "7004906160": {"Name": "Fernandes O.A.", "AuthorID": "7004906160", "AffiliationID": "60006028", "AffiliationName": "School of Agricultural and Veterinarian Sciences, S\u00e3o Paulo State University (UNESP)"}, "9738531900": {"Name": "Nascimento F.S.", "AuthorID": "9738531900", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Biologia, Faculdade de Filosofia Ci\u00eancias e Letras de Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo"}}}
