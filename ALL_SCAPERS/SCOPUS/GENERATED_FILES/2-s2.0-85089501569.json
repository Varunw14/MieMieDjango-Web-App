Diffusion of hydrogen and/or oxygen species has been reported to promote doping within graphitic grains; however, the origin and dynamics of the magnetic phenomena (i.e. superconductive ordering), which arise as a consequence of this doping-process, are still not well understood. In this work, we investigated the relationship between magnetic-ordering and hydrogen/oxygen doping in highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). Diamagnetic lamellae exfoliated from HOPG were soaked in water and alcoholic beverages, with a variable ethanol concentration (0\u201360%). Superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy were employed for an in-depth characterization of undoped and doped lamellae. Presence of a hydrogen-induced ferromagnetic ordering in the \u03c0-electrons is demonstrated. To further enhance infiltration and achieve enhanced ferromagnetic signals, Isostatic-Pressure-Wine-Doping was employed. The application of pressure-induced disruption of the regular mosaic distribution within HOPG layers enhanced 1) the diffusion of the dopant within the layers and 2) the ferromagnetic response of the samples.", "AuthorKeywords": ["HOPG", "Hydrogen doping", "Magnetism"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electron paramagnetic resonances (EPR)", "Ethanol concentrations", "Ferromagnetic correlations", "Ferromagnetic orderings", "Ferromagnetic response", "Ferromagnetic signals", "Graphite materials", "Highly oriented pyrolytic graphite"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089501569", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57218551738": {"Name": "Gao S.", "AuthorID": "57218551738", "AffiliationID": "60016521", "AffiliationName": "College of Physics, Sichuan University"}, "57204964413": {"Name": "Taallah A.", "AuthorID": "57204964413", "AffiliationID": "60016521", "AffiliationName": "College of Physics, Sichuan University"}, "57194338274": {"Name": "Odunmbaku O.", "AuthorID": "57194338274", "AffiliationID": "60016521", "AffiliationName": "College of Physics, Sichuan University"}, "55816684500": {"Name": "Boi F.S.", "AuthorID": "55816684500", "AffiliationID": "60016521", "AffiliationName": "College of Physics, Sichuan University"}, "57204557561": {"Name": "Dong J.", "AuthorID": "57204557561", "AffiliationID": "60010421", "AffiliationName": "Southwest Jiaotong University, School of Materials Science and Engineering"}, "57218552684": {"Name": "Luo N.", "AuthorID": "57218552684", "AffiliationID": "60010421", "AffiliationName": "Southwest Jiaotong University, School of Materials Science and Engineering"}, "27171237000": {"Name": "Grasso S.", "AuthorID": "27171237000", "AffiliationID": "60010421", "AffiliationName": "Southwest Jiaotong University, School of Materials Science and Engineering"}, "56456916900": {"Name": "Guo J.", "AuthorID": "56456916900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "35573970800": {"Name": "Lei L.", "AuthorID": "35573970800", "AffiliationID": "60016521", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Atomic and Molecular Physics, Sichuan University"}, "23098857300": {"Name": "Wen J.", "AuthorID": "23098857300", "AffiliationID": "60016521", "AffiliationName": "Analytical and Testing Center, Sichuan University"}, "56228660700": {"Name": "Wang S.", "AuthorID": "56228660700", "AffiliationID": "60016521", "AffiliationName": "Analytical and Testing Center, Sichuan University"}, "56486342400": {"Name": "He Y.", "AuthorID": "56486342400", "AffiliationID": "60016521", "AffiliationName": "Analytical and Testing Center, Sichuan University"}}}
