In pseudostratified epithelia, where nuclei are staggered across the tissue, each nucleus migrates apically before undergoing mitosis. Successful apical nuclear migration is critical for planar-orientated cell divisions in densely packed epithelia. Most previous investigations have focused on the local cellular mechanisms controlling nuclear migration. Inter-species and inter-organ comparisons of different pseudostratified epithelia suggest global tissue architecture may influence nuclear dynamics, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we use the developing Drosophila wing disc to systematically investigate, in a single epithelial type, how changes in tissue architecture during growth influence mitotic nuclear migration. We observe distinct nuclear dynamics at discrete developmental stages, as epithelial morphology changes. We use genetic and physical perturbations to show a direct effect of cell density on mitotic nuclear positioning. We find Rho kinase and Diaphanous, which facilitate mitotic cell rounding in confined cell conditions, are essential for efficient apical nuclear movement. Perturbation of Diaphanous causes increasing defects in apical nuclear migration as the tissue grows and cell density increases, and these defects can be reversed by acute physical reduction of cell density. Our findings reveal how the mechanical environment imposed on cells within a tissue alters the molecular and cellular mechanisms adopted by single cells for mitosis.\u00a9 2020 The AuthorsBy using genetic and physical manipulations of cell packing, Kirkland et al. find a density-dependent regulation of mitotic nuclear dynamics in the developing Drosophila wing disc. Moreover, they show a differential requirement of Rok and Dia for mitotic rounding and apical nuclear positioning as cell density increases during development.", "AuthorKeywords": ["diaphanous", "interkinetic nuclear migration", "mitosis", "mitotic rounding", "pseudostratified epithelia", "rho kinase", "tissue mechanics"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085326391", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"57205439750": {"Name": "Kirkland N.J.", "AuthorID": "57205439750", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "57205439133": {"Name": "Yuen A.C.", "AuthorID": "57205439133", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "24759324900": {"Name": "Tozluoglu M.", "AuthorID": "24759324900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "57216928648": {"Name": "Hui N.", "AuthorID": "57216928648", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "11240220400": {"Name": "Paluch E.K.", "AuthorID": "11240220400", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "55459037100": {"Name": "Mao Y.", "AuthorID": "55459037100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for the Physics of Living Systems, University College London"}}}
