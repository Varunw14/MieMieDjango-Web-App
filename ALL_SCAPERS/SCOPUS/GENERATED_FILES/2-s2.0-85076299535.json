One treatment involves a wearable neuromodulator targeting frontal nerves. Studies based on this technique have shown limited efficacy and the existing setting can cause pain. These may be associated with neuroanatomical variations which lead to high levels of required stimulus current. The aim of this paper is to study the effect of such variations on the activation currents of the Cefaly neuromodulator. Also, using a different electrode orientation, the possibility of reducing activation current levels to avoid painful side-effects and improve efficacy, is explored. Approach. This paper investigates the effect of neuroanatomical variations and electrode orientation on the stimulus current thresholds using a computational hybrid model involving a volume conductor and an advanced nerve model. Ten human head models are developed considering statistical variations of key neuroanatomical features, to model a representative population. Main results. By simulating the required stimulus current level in the head models, it is shown that neuroanatomical variations have a significant impact on the outcome, which is not solely a function of one specific neuroanatomical feature. The stimulus current thresholds based on the conventional Cefaly system vary from 4.4 mA to 25.1 mA across all head models. By altering the electrode orientation to align with the nerve branches, the stimulus current thresholds are substantially reduced to between 0.28 mA and 15 mA, reducing current density near pain-sensitive structures which may lead to a higher level of patient acceptance, further improving the efficacy. Significance. Computational modeling based on statistically valid neuroanatomical parameters, covering a representative adult population, offers a powerful tool for quantitative comparison of the effect of the position of stimulating electrodes which is otherwise not possible in clinical studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["computational models", "electrode orientation", "frontal nerve", "migraine", "neuroanatomical variations", "neuromodulator", "neurostimulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Computational model", "frontal nerve", "migraine", "neuroanatomical variations", "neuromodulator", "Neurostimulation", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Computer Simulation", "Electrodes", "Female", "Humans", "Implantable Neurostimulators", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Migraine Disorders", "Models, Anatomic", "Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076299535", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"57195524875": {"Name": "Salkim E.", "AuthorID": "57195524875", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55613665300": {"Name": "Shiraz A.", "AuthorID": "55613665300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "6603720155": {"Name": "Demosthenous A.", "AuthorID": "6603720155", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
