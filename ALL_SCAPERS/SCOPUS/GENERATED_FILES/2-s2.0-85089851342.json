Let G be a graph on n vertices with minimum degree at least 3n/4. Then for every 2-edge-colouring of G, the vertex set V (G) may be partitioned into two vertex-disjoint cycles, one of each colour. We prove this conjecture for large n, improving approximate results by the afore-mentioned authors and by DeBiasio and Nelsen.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089851342", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Geometry and Topology", "MATH", "2608"], ["Discrete Mathematics and Combinatorics", "MATH", "2607"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"55227074100": {"Name": "Letzter S.", "AuthorID": "55227074100", "AffiliationID": "60119937, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics, University of Cambridge"}}}
