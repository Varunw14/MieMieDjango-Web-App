Identifying risk for early mortality in ICD candidates could be challenging. We aimed to identify factors associated with a \u22641-year survival among patients implanted with ICDs. Methods: The DAI-PP program was a multicenter, observational French study that included all patients who received a primary prevention ICD in the 2002\u20132012 period. Characteristics of patients who survived \u22641 year following the implantation were compared with those who survived >1 year, and predictors of early death determined. Results: Out of the 5539 enrolled patients, survival status at 1 year was known for a total of 5,457, and overall 230 (4.2%) survived \u22641 year. Causes of death were similar in the two groups. Patients with \u22641-year survival had lower rates of appropriate (14 vs. 23%; P = 0.004) and inappropriate ICD therapies (2 vs. 7%; P = 0.009) than patients who lived >1 year after ICD implantation. In multivariate analysis, older age, higher NYHA class (\u2265III), and atrial fibrillation were significantly associated with \u22641-year survival. Presence of all 3 risk factors was associated with a cumulative 22.63% risk of death within 1 year after implantation. Conclusions: This is the largest study determining the factors predicting early mortality after ICD implantation. Patients dying within the first year had low ICD therapy rates. A combination of clinical factors could potentially identify patients at risk for early mortality to help improve selection of ICD candidates.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Guideline", "Heart failure", "Implantable cardioverter defibrillator", "Mortality", "Prevention", "Sudden cardiac death"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Atrial Fibrillation", "Cause of Death", "Death, Sudden, Cardiac", "Defibrillators, Implantable", "Electric Countershock", "Female", "France", "Heart Failure", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prognosis", "Prosthesis Implantation", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Survival Analysis", "Tachycardia, Ventricular"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075510324", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"56411452300": {"Name": "Garcia R.", "AuthorID": "56411452300", "AffiliationID": "60020859", "AffiliationName": "CHU Poitiers"}, "6701478201": {"Name": "Boveda S.", "AuthorID": "6701478201", "AffiliationID": "60007745", "AffiliationName": "Clinique Pasteur"}, "15769947600": {"Name": "Providencia R.", "AuthorID": "15769947600", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "12143483700": {"Name": "Marijon E.", "AuthorID": "12143483700", "AffiliationID": "60030857, 60123796, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "AP-HP, H\u00f4pital Europ\u00e9en Georges Pompidou, 75015 Paris and Universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes"}, "7003896138": {"Name": "Defaye P.", "AuthorID": "7003896138", "AffiliationID": "60002060", "AffiliationName": "CHU Michallon"}, "7005602491": {"Name": "Sadoul N.", "AuthorID": "7005602491", "AffiliationID": "60031500", "AffiliationName": "CHU Brabois"}, "57042348100": {"Name": "Narayanan K.", "AuthorID": "57042348100", "AffiliationID": "60136279, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Paris Cardiovascular Research Center (Inserm U970)"}, "54895042600": {"Name": "Perier M.C.", "AuthorID": "54895042600", "AffiliationID": "60136279, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Paris Cardiovascular Research Center (Inserm U970)"}, "7006022938": {"Name": "Klug D.", "AuthorID": "7006022938", "AffiliationID": "60017724", "AffiliationName": "CHRU Lille"}, "7005282545": {"Name": "Fauchier L.", "AuthorID": "7005282545", "AffiliationID": "60009686", "AffiliationName": "CHU Trousseau"}, "7005378102": {"Name": "Babuty D.", "AuthorID": "7005378102", "AffiliationID": "60009686", "AffiliationName": "CHU Trousseau"}, "7006426549": {"Name": "Leclercq C.", "AuthorID": "7006426549", "AffiliationID": "60026968", "AffiliationName": "CHU Pontchaillou"}, "23392115400": {"Name": "Bordachar P.", "AuthorID": "23392115400", "AffiliationID": "60003434", "AffiliationName": "CHU Haut-L\u00e9v\u00eaque"}, "7004683240": {"Name": "Gras D.", "AuthorID": "7004683240", "AffiliationID": "123502486", "AffiliationName": "H\u00f4pital Priv\u00e9 Du Confluent"}, "7004231392": {"Name": "Deharo J.C.", "AuthorID": "7004231392", "AffiliationID": "60024144", "AffiliationName": "CHU La Timone"}, "7006174412": {"Name": "Piot O.", "AuthorID": "7006174412", "AffiliationID": "60032103", "AffiliationName": "Centre Cardiologique Du Nord"}, "24329111300": {"Name": "Algalarrondo V.", "AuthorID": "24329111300", "AffiliationID": "60022785, 60123796, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "AP-HP, CHU Bichat Claude Bernard and Universit\u00e9 Paris Diderot"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
