Diabetic Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Diabetes UKAims: Sustained engagement in type 1 diabetes self-management behaviours is a critical element in achieving improvements in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and minimising risk of complications. Evaluations of self-management programmes, such as Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating (DAFNE), typically find that initial improvements are rarely sustained beyond 12 months. This study identified behaviours involved in sustained type 1 diabetes self-management, their influences and relationships to each other. Methods: A mixed-methods study was conducted following the first two steps of the Behaviour Change Wheel framework. First, an expert stakeholder consultation identified behaviours involved in self-management of type 1 diabetes. Second, three evidence sources (systematic review, healthcare provider-generated \u2018red flags\u2019 and participant-generated \u2018frequently asked questions\u2019) were analysed to identify and synthesise modifiable barriers and enablers to sustained self-management. These were characterised according to the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) model. Results: 150 distinct behaviours were identified and organised into three self-regulatory behavioural cycles, reflecting different temporal and situational aspects of diabetes self-management: Routine (e.g. checking blood glucose), Reactive (e.g. treating hypoglycaemia) and Reflective (e.g. reviewing blood glucose data to identify patterns). Thirty-four barriers and five enablers were identified: 10 relating to Capability, 20 to Opportunity and nine to Motivation. Conclusions: Multiple behaviours within three self-management cycles are involved in sustained type 1 diabetes self-management. There are a wide range of barriers and enablers that should be addressed to support self-management behaviours and improve clinical outcomes. The present study provides an evidence base for refining and developing type 1 diabetes self-management programmes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85097444625", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"57220712582": {"Name": "Hamilton K.", "AuthorID": "57220712582", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Behaviour Change, University College London"}, "37060739300": {"Name": "Stanton-Fay S.H.", "AuthorID": "37060739300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Behaviour Change, University College London"}, "57220488468": {"Name": "Chadwick P.M.", "AuthorID": "57220488468", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Behaviour Change, University College London"}, "55361024100": {"Name": "Lorencatto F.", "AuthorID": "55361024100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Behaviour Change, University College London"}, "7004779970": {"Name": "Michie S.", "AuthorID": "7004779970", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Behaviour Change, University College London"}, "8393710900": {"Name": "de Zoysa N.", "AuthorID": "8393710900", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Diabetes Centre, King\u2019s College Hospital"}, "38761174800": {"Name": "Gianfrancesco C.", "AuthorID": "38761174800", "AffiliationID": "60024453", "AffiliationName": "Sheffield Diabetes and Endocrine Centre, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHSF Trust"}, "55463039200": {"Name": "Taylor C.", "AuthorID": "55463039200", "AffiliationID": "60024453", "AffiliationName": "Sheffield Diabetes and Endocrine Centre, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHSF Trust"}, "56709389000": {"Name": "Coates E.", "AuthorID": "56709389000", "AffiliationID": "60176589, 60001881", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Related Research, University of Sheffield"}, "56270564100": {"Name": "Breckenridge J.P.", "AuthorID": "56270564100", "AffiliationID": "60008877", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing and Health Sciences, University of Dundee"}, "35490418400": {"Name": "Cooke D.", "AuthorID": "35490418400", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Sciences, University of Surrey"}, "7101979372": {"Name": "Heller S.R.", "AuthorID": "7101979372", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology and Metabolism, University of Sheffield"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
