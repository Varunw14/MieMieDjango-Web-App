This study employs a questionnaire survey to explore the effects of the thermal-acoustic environment in urban squares on subjective evaluations (thermal evaluations, acoustic evaluations, and overall comfort) in severe cold regions. It also evaluates and predicts equivalent overall comfort under different conditions of the thermal-acoustic environment. The results indicate that with respect to thermal evaluations, a higher temperature causes a significant increase in thermal sensation in all the three seasons (summer, the transitional season, and winter) while traffic noise causes a slight increase in thermal sensation only in summer. Meanwhile, both temperature and traffic noise affect thermal comfort in all three seasons, with higher traffic noise causing lower thermal comfort. With respect to acoustic evaluations, higher traffic noise results in a more negative evaluation of subjective loudness and acoustic comfort, while the low temperature in winter and high temperature in summer increase acoustic discomfort. However, the interaction of temperature and traffic noise has an effect on acoustic comfort only in summer. In addition, temperature significantly affects overall comfort in all three seasons, while traffic noise has an effect only in the transitional season and summer; however, their interaction affects overall comfort only in winter.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Combined effects", "Severe cold region", "Subjective evaluations", "Temperature", "Traffic noise", "Urban squares"], "IndexKeywords": ["Combined effect", "Severe cold regions", "Subjective evaluations", "Traffic noise", "Urban squares"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075033237", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"]], "AuthorData": {"57196299037": {"Name": "Jin Y.", "AuthorID": "57196299037", "AffiliationID": "60019616", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Cold Region Urban and Rural Human Settlement Environment Science and Technology, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, School of Architecture, Harbin Institute of Technology"}, "27168583800": {"Name": "Jin H.", "AuthorID": "27168583800", "AffiliationID": "60019616", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Cold Region Urban and Rural Human Settlement Environment Science and Technology, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, School of Architecture, Harbin Institute of Technology"}, "55485135500": {"Name": "Kang J.", "AuthorID": "55485135500", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}}}
