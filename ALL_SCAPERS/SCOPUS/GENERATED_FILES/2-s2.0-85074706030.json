The implicit assumption\u2014that if risks are fully revealed, finance will respond rationally and in ways aligned with the public interest\u2014is rooted in the \u201cefficient market hypothesis\u201d (EMH) applied to the finance sector and its perception of climate policy. For low carbon investment, particular hopes have been placed on the role of institutional investors, given the apparent matching of their assets and liabilities with the long timescales of climate change. We both explain theoretical frameworks (grounded in the \u201cthree domains\u201d, namely satisficing, optimizing, and transforming) and use empirical evidence (from a survey of institutional investors), to show that the EMH is unsupported by either theory or evidence: it follows that transparency alone will be an inadequate response. To some extent, transparency can address behavioural biases (first domain characteristics), and improving pricing and market efficiency (second domain); however, the strategic (third domain) limitations of EMH are more serious. We argue that whilst transparency can help, on its own it is a very long way from an adequate response to the challenges of \u2018aligning institutional climate finance\u2019.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Climate finance", "Disclosure", "Efficient markets hypothesis", "Institutional investors", "Low-carbon investment", "Planetary economics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Disclosure", "Efficient market hypothesis", "Efficient markets hypothesis", "Financial disclosure", "Financial stability", "Institutional investors", "Low carbon", "Theoretical framework"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074706030", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"]], "AuthorData": {"55324072800": {"Name": "Ameli N.", "AuthorID": "55324072800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Sustainable Resources, University College London"}, "56684499800": {"Name": "Drummond P.", "AuthorID": "56684499800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Sustainable Resources, University College London"}, "7006809226": {"Name": "Grubb M.", "AuthorID": "7006809226", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Sustainable Resources, University College London"}, "12647510000": {"Name": "Chenet H.", "AuthorID": "12647510000", "AffiliationID": "123422068", "AffiliationName": "Chair Energy and Prosperity"}, "36489025800": {"Name": "Bisaro A.", "AuthorID": "36489025800", "AffiliationID": "113016681", "AffiliationName": "Global Climate Forum (GCF)"}}}
