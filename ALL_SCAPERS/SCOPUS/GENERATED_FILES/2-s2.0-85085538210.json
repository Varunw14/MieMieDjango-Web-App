Macular spectral domain optical coherence tomography images were acquired from monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins in a cross-sectional study. The following layer volumes were derived for circles of 3 and 6 mm diameter around the foveal center, using automated segmentation software: retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), ganglion cell\u2013inner plexiform layer (GCIPL), inner nuclear layer (INL), outer plexiform layer (OPL), outer nuclear layer (ONL), photoreceptors (PR), retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and total retinal volume (TRV). Correlation coefficients (intereye; age; intrapair for MZ and DZ pairs) were quantified; heritability was estimated using structural equation modeling. RESULTS. Scans from 184 participants were included. Intereye correlation was highest for TRV and GCIPL. Negative correlations with age (for 3- or 6-mm areas, or both) were observed for TRV, RNFL, GCIPL, and INL. Positive correlations were observed for PR, RPE, and OPL. For all layers, intrapair correlation was greater for MZ than DZ pairs. Heritability estimates were highest (>80%) for TRV and GCIPL volume, and lowest for RPE volume. CONCLUSIONS. Although TRV was negatively correlated with age, all layers did not show negative correlation. Some inner layers thinned with age, whereas some outer volumes increased (not the ONL). Reduced RPE phagocytic function with age and remodeling in the OPL could be contributing factors. Heritability estimates were highest for inner retinal layers (particularly GCIPL), and lowest for RPE volume.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Macula", "Optical coherence tomography", "Photoreceptors", "Retina", "Twin study"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Correlation of Data", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Inheritance Patterns", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Organ Size", "Retina", "Tomography, Optical Coherence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085538210", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"57204161821": {"Name": "Lamin A.", "AuthorID": "57204161821", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Retinal Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "35547907400": {"Name": "Sivaprasad S.", "AuthorID": "35547907400", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Retinal Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "6507036910": {"Name": "Mahroo O.A.", "AuthorID": "6507036910", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, King\u2019s College London"}, "55303290400": {"Name": "Williams K.M.", "AuthorID": "55303290400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, King\u2019s College London"}, "57216960613": {"Name": "Garg A.", "AuthorID": "57216960613", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Retinal Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "55369613800": {"Name": "Basheer K.", "AuthorID": "55369613800", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Retinal Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "54681997900": {"Name": "Jarrar Z.", "AuthorID": "54681997900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, King\u2019s College London"}, "57220728635": {"Name": "Hammond C.J.", "AuthorID": "57220728635", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, King\u2019s College London"}}}
