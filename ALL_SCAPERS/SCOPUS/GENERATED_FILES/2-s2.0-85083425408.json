The development of wireless biosensor nodes and networks strongly relies on the design of novel low-power, low-cost and flexible CMOS sensor readouts. This brief presents a CMOS potentiostat that integrates a control amplifier, a dual-slope ADC and a wireless unit on the same chip. It implements a novel time-based readout scheme, whereby the counter of the dual-slope ADC is moved to the receiver and the sensor current is encoded in the timing between two wireless pulses transmitted via pulse-harmonic modulation across an inductive link. Measured results show that the potentiostat chip can resolve a minimum input current of 10pA at a sampling frequency of 125 Hz and a power consumption of $12~\\mu \\text{W}$.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amperometry", "biosensors", "dual-slope ADC", "potentiostat", "pulse harmonic modulation", "wireless"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amperometric measurements", "Disease detection", "Harmonic modulations", "Health monitoring", "Measured results", "Sampling frequencies", "Time-based readouts", "Wireless biosensors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083425408", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"26428589100": {"Name": "Valente V.", "AuthorID": "26428589100", "AffiliationID": "60006288", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microelectronics, Delft University of Technology"}, "38961723700": {"Name": "Neshatvar N.", "AuthorID": "38961723700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "54396088900": {"Name": "Pilavaki E.", "AuthorID": "54396088900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57039198600": {"Name": "Schormans M.", "AuthorID": "57039198600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "6603720155": {"Name": "Demosthenous A.", "AuthorID": "6603720155", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
