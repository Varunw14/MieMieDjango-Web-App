Much of this research focus has centered on the ectodomain of the spike protein. The ectodomain is anchored to a transmembrane region, followed by a cytoplasmic tail. Here we report a distant sequence similarity between the cysteine-rich cytoplasmic tail of the coronavirus spike protein and the hepcidin protein that is found in humans and other vertebrates. Hepcidin is thought to be the key regulator of iron metabolism in humans through its inhibition of the iron-exporting protein ferroportin. An implication of this preliminary observation is to suggest a potential route of investigation in the coronavirus research field making use of an already-established literature on the interplay of local and systemic iron regulation, cytokine-mediated inflammatory processes, respiratory infections and the hepcidin protein. The question of possible homology and an evolutionary connection between the viral spike protein and hepcidin is not assessed in this report, but some scenarios for its study are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coronavirus", "COVID-19", "Cysteine", "Ferroportin", "Hepcidin", "IL-6", "Inflammation", "Iron", "Pufferfish", "Sequence similarity", "Spike protein"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Betacoronavirus", "Cation Transport Proteins", "Coronavirus Infections", "Cysteine", "Cytokines", "Cytoplasm", "Hepcidins", "Humans", "Hypoxia", "Inflammation", "Interleukin-6", "Iron", "Pandemics", "Pneumonia, Viral", "Protein Domains", "Protein Processing, Post-Translational", "Sequence Alignment", "Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus", "Tetraodontiformes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092734114", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"23099742400": {"Name": "Ehsani S.", "AuthorID": "23099742400", "AffiliationID": "60159938", "AffiliationName": "Ronin Institute for Independent Scholarship"}}}
