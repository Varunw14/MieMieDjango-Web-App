The OPTIMA Prelim randomised controlled trial (ISRCTN42400492) randomised patients with early stage breast cancer to chemotherapy versus \u2018test-directed\u2019 chemotherapy, with a possible outcome of no chemotherapy, which could confer less treatment relative to routine practice. Despite encountering challenges, OPTIMA Prelim reached its recruitment target ahead of schedule. This study reports the root causes of recruitment challenges and the strategies used to successfully overcome them. Materials and methods: A mixed-methods recruitment intervention (QuinteT Recruitment Intervention) was used to investigate the recruitment difficulties and feedback findings to inform interventions and optimise ongoing recruitment. Quantitative site-level recruitment data, audio-recorded recruitment appointments (n = 46), qualitative interviews (n = 22) with trialists/recruiting staff (oncologists/nurses) and patient-facing documentation were analysed using descriptive, thematic and conversation analyses. Findings were triangulated to inform a \u2018plan of action\u2019 to optimise recruitment. Results: Despite best intentions, oncologists' routine practices complicated recruitment. Discomfort about deviating from the usual practice of recommending chemotherapy according to tumour clinicopathological features meant that not all eligible patients were approached. Audio-recorded recruitment appointments revealed how routine practices undermined recruitment. A tendency to justify chemotherapy provision before presenting the randomised controlled trial and subtly indicating that chemotherapy would be more/less beneficial undermined equipoise and made it difficult for patients to engage with OPTIMA Prelim. To tackle these challenges, individual and group recruiter feedback focussed on communication issues and vignettes of eligible patients were discussed to address discomforts around approaching patients. \u2018Tips\u2019 documents concerning structuring discussions and conveying equipoise were disseminated across sites, together with revisions to the Patient Information Sheet. Conclusions: This is the first study illuminating the tension between oncologists' routine practices and recruitment to de-escalation trials. Although time and resources are required, these challenges can be addressed through specific feedback and training as the trial is underway.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Breast cancer", "de-escalation trial", "equipoise", "qualitative research", "randomised controlled trials", "recruitment"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079850187", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57201461359": {"Name": "Conefrey C.", "AuthorID": "57201461359", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "57216136366": {"Name": "Donovan J.L.", "AuthorID": "57216136366", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "37061720100": {"Name": "Paramasivan S.", "AuthorID": "37061720100", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "56229605700": {"Name": "Rooshenas L.", "AuthorID": "56229605700", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "7402952709": {"Name": "Stein R.C.", "AuthorID": "7402952709", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research, University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre"}, "56657083700": {"Name": "Marshall A.", "AuthorID": "56657083700", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "57114108000": {"Name": "Campbell A.", "AuthorID": "57114108000", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "7403290304": {"Name": "Dunn J.", "AuthorID": "7403290304", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "57209118147": {"Name": "Bartlett J.", "AuthorID": "57209118147", "AffiliationID": "60101854", "AffiliationName": "Ontario Institute for Cancer Research"}, "7402888874": {"Name": "Cameron D.", "AuthorID": "7402888874", "AffiliationID": "60027272, 60012754, 60013999", "AffiliationName": "The University of Edinburgh, Cancer Research UK Edinburgh Centre, Western General Hospital, EH4 University Cancer Centre, University of Edinburgh"}, "57207416747": {"Name": "Hall P.", "AuthorID": "57207416747", "AffiliationID": "60027272, 60012754, 60013999", "AffiliationName": "The University of Edinburgh, Cancer Research UK Edinburgh Centre, Western General Hospital, EH4 University Cancer Centre, University of Edinburgh"}, "7006036785": {"Name": "Earl H.", "AuthorID": "7006036785", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "Oncology Centre, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "6603688989": {"Name": "Hughes-Davies L.", "AuthorID": "6603688989", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "Oncology Centre, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "24829445200": {"Name": "Harmer V.", "AuthorID": "24829445200", "AffiliationID": "60012558, 60111785", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, Charing Cross Hospital"}, "8791558200": {"Name": "Macpherson I.", "AuthorID": "8791558200", "AffiliationID": "60000265", "AffiliationName": "Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre"}, "35480217900": {"Name": "Makris A.", "AuthorID": "35480217900", "AffiliationID": "60006776", "AffiliationName": "Mount Vernon Cancer Centre, Mount Vernon Hospital"}, "55427817400": {"Name": "Morgan A.", "AuthorID": "55427817400", "AffiliationID": "113162838", "AffiliationName": "Independent Cancer Patients' Voice"}, "57194691075": {"Name": "Pinder S.", "AuthorID": "57194691075", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Comprehensive Cancer Centre at Guy's Hospital"}, "57194207612": {"Name": "Poole C.", "AuthorID": "57194207612", "AffiliationID": "60006343", "AffiliationName": "Arden Cancer Centre, University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire"}, "57200847550": {"Name": "Rea D.", "AuthorID": "57200847550", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
