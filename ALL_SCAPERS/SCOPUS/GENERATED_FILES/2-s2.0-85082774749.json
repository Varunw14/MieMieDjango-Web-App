We report KEYNOTE-010 long-term outcomes, including after 35 cycles/2 years or second-course pembrolizumab. METHODS Of 1,033 patients randomly assigned (intention to treat), 690 received up to 35 cycles/2 years of pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg (n = 344) or 10 mg/kg (n = 346) every 3 weeks, and 343 received docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. Eligible patients with disease progression after 35 cycles/2 years of pembrolizumab could receive second-course treatment (up to 17 cycles). Pembrolizumab doses were pooled because no between-dose difference was observed at primary analysis. RESULTS Pembrolizumab continued to improve OS over docetaxel in the PD-L1 TPS $ 50% and $ 1% groups (hazard ratio [HR], 0.53; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.66; P, .00001; and HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.80; P, .00001, respectively) after a 42.6-month (range, 35.2-53.2 months) median follow-up. Estimated 36-month OS rates were 34.5% versus 12.7% and 22.9% versus 11.0%, respectively. Grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 16% versus 37% of patients, respectively. Seventy-nine of 690 patients completed 35 cycles/2 years of pembrolizumab; 12-month OS and progression-free survival rates after completing treatment were 98.7% (95% CI, 91.1% to 99.8%) and 72.5% (95% CI, 59.9% to 81.8%), respectively. Seventy-five patients (95%) had objective response (RECIST v1.1, blinded independent central review) and 48 (64%) had ongoing response. Grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 17.7% of patients. Fourteen patients received second-course pembrolizumab: 5 completed 17 cycles, 6 (43%) had partial response, and 5 (36%) had stable disease. CONCLUSION Pembrolizumab provided long-term OS benefit over docetaxel, with manageable safety, durable responses among patients receiving 2 years of treatment, and disease control with second-course treatment, further supporting pembrolizumab for previously treated, PD-L1\u2012expressing advanced NSCLC.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082774749", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"7102823077": {"Name": "Herbst R.S.", "AuthorID": "7102823077", "AffiliationID": "60030849, 60017994", "AffiliationName": "Comprehensive Cancer Center, Yale School of Medicine"}, "22955402100": {"Name": "Garon E.B.", "AuthorID": "22955402100", "AffiliationID": "60005247, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles"}, "56189698600": {"Name": "Dong-Wan K.", "AuthorID": "56189698600", "AffiliationID": "60021119", "AffiliationName": "Seoul National University Hospital"}, "57211677252": {"Name": "Cho B.C.", "AuthorID": "57211677252", "AffiliationID": "60115402, 60016728", "AffiliationName": "Yonsei Cancer Center, Yonsei University College of Medicine"}, "6505953589": {"Name": "Perez-Gracia J.L.", "AuthorID": "6505953589", "AffiliationID": "60033320", "AffiliationName": "Clinica Universidad de Navarra"}, "32167519600": {"Name": "Ji-Youn H.", "AuthorID": "32167519600", "AffiliationID": "124204628", "AffiliationName": "National Cancer Center, Korea"}, "57006787500": {"Name": "Arvis C.D.", "AuthorID": "57006787500", "AffiliationID": "60031062", "AffiliationName": "Centre Fran\u00e7ois Baclesse"}, "24587678300": {"Name": "Majem M.", "AuthorID": "24587678300", "AffiliationID": "60009466", "AffiliationName": "Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau"}, "57189580188": {"Name": "Forster M.D.", "AuthorID": "57189580188", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London Hospitals"}, "16216438200": {"Name": "Monnet I.", "AuthorID": "16216438200", "AffiliationID": "60000832", "AffiliationName": "Centre Hospitalier Intercommunal de Cr\u00e9teil"}, "6603853615": {"Name": "Novello S.", "AuthorID": "6603853615", "AffiliationID": "60103367, 60012259", "AffiliationName": "University of Turin, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria San Luigi Gonzaga"}, "57189694593": {"Name": "Szalai Z.", "AuthorID": "57189694593", "AffiliationID": "100329490", "AffiliationName": "Petz Alad\u00e1r County Teaching Hospital"}, "6504478338": {"Name": "Gubens M.A.", "AuthorID": "6504478338", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "University of California, San Francisco"}, "57154874700": {"Name": "Wu-Chou S.", "AuthorID": "57154874700", "AffiliationID": "60073386", "AffiliationName": "National Cheng Kung University Hospital"}, "7003595316": {"Name": "Ceresoli G.L.", "AuthorID": "7003595316", "AffiliationID": "60110893", "AffiliationName": "Cliniche Humanitas Gavazzeni"}, "24069408600": {"Name": "Samkari A.", "AuthorID": "24069408600", "AffiliationID": "60007995", "AffiliationName": "Merck & Co"}, "7202082039": {"Name": "Jensen E.H.", "AuthorID": "7202082039", "AffiliationID": "60007995", "AffiliationName": "Merck & Co"}, "6506182577": {"Name": "Lubiniecki G.M.", "AuthorID": "6506182577", "AffiliationID": "60007995", "AffiliationName": "Merck & Co"}, "57204335047": {"Name": "Baas P.", "AuthorID": "57204335047", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "The, Netherlands Cancer Institute"}}}
