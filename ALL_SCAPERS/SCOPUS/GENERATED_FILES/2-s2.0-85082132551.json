All of our five senses (i.e. taste, smell, vision, hearing and touch) are involved, even if we are not aware of it. However, while multisensory integration has been well studied in psychology, there is not a single platform for testing systematically the effects of different stimuli. This lack of platform results in unresolved design challenges for the design of taste-based immersive experiences. Here, we present LeviSense: the first system designed for multisensory integration in gustatory experiences based on levitated food. Our system enables the systematic exploration of different sensory effects on eating experiences. It also opens up new opportunities for other professionals (e.g., molecular gastronomy chefs) looking for innovative taste-delivery platforms. We describe the design process behind LeviSense and conduct two experiments to test a subset of the crossmodal combinations (i.e., taste and vision, taste and smell). Our results show how different lighting and smell conditions affect the perceived taste intensity, pleasantness, and satisfaction. We discuss how LeviSense creates a new technical, creative, and expressive possibilities in a series of emerging design spaces within Human-Food Interaction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acoustic levitation", "Flavour", "Food delivery system", "Food interaction design", "Multisensory", "Taste", "Taste experience", "Taste perception"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic levitation", "Food delivery", "Food interactions", "Multisensory", "Taste", "Taste experience", "Taste perceptions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082132551", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human Factors and Ergonomics", "SOCI", "3307"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"]], "AuthorData": {"55247108300": {"Name": "Vi C.T.", "AuthorID": "55247108300", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Sussex Ingestive Behaviour Group, School of Psychology, University of Sussex"}, "56582009700": {"Name": "Maggioni E.", "AuthorID": "56582009700", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "SCHI Lab, Informatics Department, School of Engineering and Informatics, University of Sussex"}, "57194657939": {"Name": "Ablart D.", "AuthorID": "57194657939", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "SCHI Lab, Informatics Department, School of Engineering and Informatics, University of Sussex"}, "22835490000": {"Name": "Obrist M.", "AuthorID": "22835490000", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "SCHI Lab, Informatics Department, School of Engineering and Informatics, University of Sussex"}, "7006766021": {"Name": "Yeomans M.", "AuthorID": "7006766021", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Sussex Ingestive Behaviour Group, School of Psychology, University of Sussex"}, "37006934700": {"Name": "Marzo A.", "AuthorID": "37006934700", "AffiliationID": "60033019", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science, Universidad Publica de Navarra"}, "55960652900": {"Name": "Memoli G.", "AuthorID": "55960652900", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Informatics, University of Sussex"}}}
