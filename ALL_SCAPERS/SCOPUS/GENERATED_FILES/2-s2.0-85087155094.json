A sample of 515 individuals completed a short questionnaire asking them to rank-order eight different ethical positions with respect to the allocation of scarce resources. They showed a strong preference for the \u2018saves most lives\u2019 and \u2018sickest first\u2019 options, with \u2018reciprocity\u2019 and a \u2018lottery\u2019 being least favoured. There was a reasonable degree of unanimity amongst respondents and comparatively few correlations with individual difference factors such as demography. The preference results are compared to expert recommendations (Emanuel et al., 2020, N. Engl. J. Med., 382, 2049) made in light of the current coronavirus pandemic, and differences are highlighted. Implications for scare medical resource allocations are discussed, and limitations of the study acknowledged.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ethics", "lottery", "resource allocation", "utilitarianism"], "IndexKeywords": ["Betacoronavirus", "Coronavirus Infections", "Health Care Rationing", "Humans", "Pandemics", "Pneumonia, Viral"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087155094", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"]], "AuthorData": {"57190227677": {"Name": "Grover S.", "AuthorID": "57190227677", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "7004768888": {"Name": "McClelland A.", "AuthorID": "7004768888", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "36045985300": {"Name": "Furnham A.", "AuthorID": "36045985300", "AffiliationID": "60007996", "AffiliationName": "Norwegian Business School (BI)"}}}
