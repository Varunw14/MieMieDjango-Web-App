However, only small and heterogeneous studies have investigated the effect of exercise on high-density lipoprotein functions. Our aim is to evaluate, in the largest observational study to date, the association between leisure time physical activity and a range of high-density lipoprotein functional traits. Methods: The study sample consisted of 296 Spanish adults at high cardiovascular risk. Usual leisure time physical activity and eight measures of high-density lipoprotein functionality were averaged over two measurements, one year apart. Multivariable linear regression models were used to explore the association between leisure time physical activity (exposure) and each high-density lipoprotein functional trait (outcome), adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors. Results: Higher levels of leisure time physical activity were positively and linearly associated with average levels over one year of plasma high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I, paraoxonase-1 antioxidant activity, high-density lipoprotein capacity to esterify cholesterol and cholesterol efflux capacity in individuals free of type 2 diabetes only. The increased cholesterol esterification index with increasing leisure time physical activity reached a plateau at around 300 metabolic equivalents.min/day. In individuals with diabetes, the relationship with cholesteryl ester transfer protein followed a U-shape, with a decreased cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity from 0 to 300 metabolic equivalents.min/day, but increasing from there onwards. Increasing levels of leisure time physical activity were associated with poorer high-density lipoprotein vasodilatory capacity. Conclusions: In a high cardiovascular risk population, leisure time physical activity was associated not only with greater circulating levels of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, but also with better markers of high-density lipoprotein functionality, namely cholesterol efflux capacity, the capacity of high-density lipoprotein to esterify cholesterol and paraoxonase-1 antioxidant activity in individuals free of diabetes and lower cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity in individuals with type 2 diabetes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biomarkers", "HDL function", "lifestyle", "physical activity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085877354", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"55916184000": {"Name": "Hern\u00e1ez \u00c1.", "AuthorID": "55916184000", "AffiliationID": "60001602", "AffiliationName": "CIBER of Pathophysiology of Obesity and Nutrition (CIBEROBN), Instituto de Salud Carlos III"}, "57202252585": {"Name": "Soria-Florido M.T.", "AuthorID": "57202252585", "AffiliationID": "60023506", "AffiliationName": "Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute (IMIM)"}, "36487707800": {"Name": "Casta\u00f1er O.", "AuthorID": "36487707800", "AffiliationID": "60001602", "AffiliationName": "CIBER of Pathophysiology of Obesity and Nutrition (CIBEROBN), Instituto de Salud Carlos III"}, "35280719100": {"Name": "Schr\u00f6der H.", "AuthorID": "35280719100", "AffiliationID": "60085099, 60001602", "AffiliationName": "CIBER Epidemiology and Public Health (CIBERESP), Instituto de Salud Carlos III"}, "57208853460": {"Name": "Fit\u00f3 M.", "AuthorID": "57208853460", "AffiliationID": "60001602", "AffiliationName": "CIBER of Pathophysiology of Obesity and Nutrition (CIBEROBN), Instituto de Salud Carlos III"}, "35798512000": {"Name": "Lassale C.", "AuthorID": "35798512000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7005989830": {"Name": "Estruch R.", "AuthorID": "7005989830", "AffiliationID": "60030315", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Cl\u00ednic Barcelona"}, "57214783328": {"Name": "Pint\u00f3 X.", "AuthorID": "57214783328", "AffiliationID": "60011805", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Universitario de Bellvitge, L\u2019Hospitalet de Llobregat"}, "57206277408": {"Name": "Salas-Salvad\u00f3 J.", "AuthorID": "57206277408", "AffiliationID": "60108137, 60022415", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Universitari Sant Joan de Reus, Universitat Rovira i Virgili"}, "7003570538": {"Name": "Corella D.", "AuthorID": "7003570538", "AffiliationID": "60002644", "AffiliationName": "Universidad de Valencia"}, "7004308784": {"Name": "Alonso-G\u00f3mez \u00c1.", "AuthorID": "7004308784", "AffiliationID": "60027856", "AffiliationName": "Bioaraba Health Research Institute, University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU"}, "56200287800": {"Name": "Mart\u00ednez-Gonz\u00e1lez M.\u00c1.", "AuthorID": "56200287800", "AffiliationID": "60032499", "AffiliationName": "Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health"}, "57202569537": {"Name": "Ros E.", "AuthorID": "57202569537", "AffiliationID": "60030315", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Cl\u00ednic Barcelona"}, "35596972100": {"Name": "Serra-Majem L.", "AuthorID": "35596972100", "AffiliationID": "60009669", "AffiliationName": "Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria"}, "7005315313": {"Name": "Fiol M.", "AuthorID": "7005315313", "AffiliationID": "60000608", "AffiliationName": "Balearic Islands Health Research Institute"}, "6507771144": {"Name": "Lapetra J.", "AuthorID": "6507771144", "AffiliationID": "113157598", "AffiliationName": "Distrito Sanitario Atenci\u00f3n Primaria Sevilla"}, "57202571697": {"Name": "Gomez-Gracia E.", "AuthorID": "57202571697", "AffiliationID": "60003662", "AffiliationName": "Universidad de M\u00e1laga"}}}
