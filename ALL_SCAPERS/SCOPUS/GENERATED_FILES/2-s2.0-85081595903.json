By combining sound field measurement with acoustic simulation, this study investigated the effects of spatial elements and sound source characteristics in a Main Hall, revealing that both fabric sound absorbers and Buddha statues mounted within had a pronounced effect on the sound field. Using an acoustic model of the Main Hall of the Xiantong Temple as an example, when various fabric sound absorbers were removed, the mid-frequency reverberation time (T30m) and mid-frequency early decay time (EDTm) increased by 32.3% and 46.8%, respectively. When fabric sound absorbers and Buddha statues were removed, the sound pressure level was not significantly affected. The form of the roof did not significantly impact the indoor sound field. The directivity of the sound sources did not significantly affect the T30m but did affect the EDTm and the speech transmission index (STI). When monks chanted sutras face-to-face, the STI was maximized. Additionally, changing the positions of sound sources moderately affected the EDT and STI.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic quality", "Acoustic simulations", "Early decay time", "Indoor sound fields", "Reverberation time", "Sound field measurement", "Sound pressure level", "Speech transmission index"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081595903", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"]], "AuthorData": {"36769981900": {"Name": "Zhang D.", "AuthorID": "36769981900", "AffiliationID": "60031863", "AffiliationName": "JangHo Architecture College, Northeastern University"}, "57215654556": {"Name": "Lai R.", "AuthorID": "57215654556", "AffiliationID": "60031863", "AffiliationName": "JangHo Architecture College, Northeastern University"}, "56843819100": {"Name": "Zhang M.", "AuthorID": "56843819100", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "School of East Asia Studies, University of Sheffield"}, "55485135500": {"Name": "Kang J.", "AuthorID": "55485135500", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Environmental Design and Engineering, Bartlett, University College London"}}}
