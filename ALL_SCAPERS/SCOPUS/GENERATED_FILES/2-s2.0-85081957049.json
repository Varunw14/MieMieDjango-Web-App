All rights reserved.As the UK looks to a future of changing relations with its trading partners there is a clear need to invest in its port infrastructure. As part of its strategic response the UK is looking to follow other countries, especially in the EU and Asia, in investing in developing smart ports which incorporate advanced digital technologies. However, the UK is faced with the challenge of resolving many decisions regarding where to invest, what to invest in, the consequence(s) of those decisions, and how to regulate a future sector that is increasingly becoming dependent on digital information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure. Smart ports can bring benefits locally, nationally and globally from reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, creating efficient supply chains, and secure and safer working environments. Yet, embedding emerging technologies, like the Internet of Things (IoT) into critical infrastructure like ports introduces new security risks and vulnerabilities that existing governance mechanisms are often unable to address. This paper firstly examines the growth in digitalisation of seaports drawing on initiatives in Rotterdam and Singapore. Potential security risks and vulnerabilities emerging are then discussed using some case studies before turning to review existing cybersecurity governance measures for ports. The lessons the UK can learn from smart port leaders like Rotterdam and Singapore as it looks to implement the innovation and digitalisation element of its new Maritime Strategy are then highlighted with recommendations on ways forward.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brexit", "Governace", "Internet of Things", "Ports", "Security"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brexit", "Digital technologies", "Emerging technologies", "Governace", "Governance mechanisms", "Internet of thing (IOT)", "Ports", "Security"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081957049", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55790687400": {"Name": "Lesniewska F.", "AuthorID": "55790687400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "STEaPP, University College London"}, "23491291000": {"Name": "Ani U.", "AuthorID": "23491291000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "STEaPP, University College London"}, "55859713100": {"Name": "Carr M.", "AuthorID": "55859713100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "STEaPP, University College London"}, "57203669069": {"Name": "Watson J.", "AuthorID": "57203669069", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "STEaPP, University College London"}}}
