The detection of MF is usually based on radiological criteria, but no previous studies have attempted a prospective, multidimensional assessment of mesenteric desmoplasia to determine the accuracy of radiological measurements. There is also a lack of non-invasive biomarkers for the detection of image-negative MF. Methods: A multidimensional assessment of MF incorporating radiological, surgical and histological parameters was performed in a prospective cohort of 34 patients with SINENs who underwent primary resection. Pre-operative blood samples were collected in 20 cases to evaluate a set of five profibrotic circulating transcripts\u2014the \u201cfibrosome\u201d\u2014that is included as an \u201comic\u201d component of the NETest. Results: There was a significant correlation between radiological and surgical assessments of MF (p < 0.05). However, there were several cases of image-negative MF. The NETest-fibrosome demonstrated an accuracy of 100% for the detection of microscopic MF. Conclusions: The detection of MF by radiological criteria has limitations. The NETest-fibrosome is a promising biomarker for fibrosis detection and further validation of these results would be needed in larger, multicentre studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomarker", "Fibrosis", "NETest", "Neuroendocrine tumour"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074539665", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"55961896300": {"Name": "Laskaratos F.M.", "AuthorID": "55961896300", "AffiliationID": "60170516, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neuroendocrine Tumour Unit, Centre for Gastroenterology, ENETS Centre of Excellence, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust and University College London"}, "55649892900": {"Name": "Mandair D.", "AuthorID": "55649892900", "AffiliationID": "60170516, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neuroendocrine Tumour Unit, Centre for Gastroenterology, ENETS Centre of Excellence, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust and University College London"}, "55908628800": {"Name": "Caplin M.", "AuthorID": "55908628800", "AffiliationID": "60170516, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neuroendocrine Tumour Unit, Centre for Gastroenterology, ENETS Centre of Excellence, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust and University College London"}, "16033469000": {"Name": "Toumpanakis C.", "AuthorID": "16033469000", "AffiliationID": "60170516, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neuroendocrine Tumour Unit, Centre for Gastroenterology, ENETS Centre of Excellence, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust and University College London"}, "57220873579": {"Name": "Hall A.", "AuthorID": "57220873579", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cellular Pathology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57211584411": {"Name": "Alexander S.", "AuthorID": "57211584411", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cellular Pathology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "54916621100": {"Name": "Luong T.V.", "AuthorID": "54916621100", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cellular Pathology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7402110302": {"Name": "Watkins J.", "AuthorID": "7402110302", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cellular Pathology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55682302100": {"Name": "von Stempel C.", "AuthorID": "55682302100", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57211576383": {"Name": "Bretherton J.", "AuthorID": "57211576383", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57196754753": {"Name": "Ogunbiyi O.", "AuthorID": "57196754753", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Colorectal Surgery, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603058561": {"Name": "Rombouts K.", "AuthorID": "6603058561", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Regenerative Medicine & Fibrosis Group, Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, Division of Medicine, University College London"}}}
