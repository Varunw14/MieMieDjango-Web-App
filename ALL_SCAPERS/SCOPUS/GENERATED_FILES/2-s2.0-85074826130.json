One approach to generating its breather solutions is based on Darboux transformation (DT) and iterations. However, the DT of FL equation contains negative powers of the spectral parameter, which can lead to very complicated expressions when N is large. In this paper, we avoid the negative powers by adopting a variable separation and Taylor expansion technique to solve the Lax pair of FL system. Furthermore, stability of the proposed technique is demonstrated in detail.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fokas\u2013Lenells equation", "Lax pairs", "Rogue waves", "Variable separation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Darboux transformations", "Dinger equation", "Higher-order", "Lax pairs", "Rogue waves", "Spectral parameters", "Taylor expansions", "Variable separation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074826130", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Aerospace Engineering", "ENGI", "2202"], ["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57203137531": {"Name": "Wang Z.", "AuthorID": "57203137531", "AffiliationID": "60007363", "AffiliationName": "Engineering Science and Applied Mathematics Department, Northwestern University"}, "57211693217": {"Name": "He L.", "AuthorID": "57211693217", "AffiliationID": "60001439", "AffiliationName": "Harold and Inge Marcus Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Pennsylvania State University"}, "7202822682": {"Name": "Qin Z.", "AuthorID": "7202822682", "AffiliationID": "60009860", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematical Sciences and Key Laboratory of Mathematics for Nonlinear Science, Fudan University"}, "35462748600": {"Name": "Grimshaw R.", "AuthorID": "35462748600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "35183693700": {"Name": "Mu G.", "AuthorID": "35183693700", "AffiliationID": "60084628", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics, Kunming University"}}}
