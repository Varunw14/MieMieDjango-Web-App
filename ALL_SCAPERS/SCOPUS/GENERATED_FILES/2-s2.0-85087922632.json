Neurourology and Urodynamics published by Wiley Periodicals Inc.Aims: This article reviews the clinical outcomes and basic science related to negative effects of radiotherapy (RT) on the lower urinary tract (LUT) when used to treat pelvic malignancies. Methods: The topic was discussed at the 2019 meeting of the International Consultation on Incontinence\u2015Research Society during a \u201cthink tank\u201d session and is summarized in the present article. Results: RT is associated with adverse effects on the LUT, which may occur during treatment or which can develop over decades posttreatment. Here, we summarize the incidence and extent of clinical symptoms associated with several modes of delivery of RT. RT impact on normal tissues including urethra, bladder, and ureters is discussed, and the underlying biology is examined. We discuss innovative in vivo methodologies to mimic RT in the laboratory and their potential use in the elucidation of mechanisms underlying radiation-associated pathophysiology. Finally, emerging questions that need to be addressed through further research are proposed. Conclusions: We conclude that RT-induced negative effects on the LUT represent a significant clinical problem. Although this has been reduced with improved methods of delivery to spare normal tissue, we need to (a) discover better approaches to protect normal tissue and (b) develop effective treatments to reverse radiation damage.", "AuthorKeywords": ["brachytherapy", "external beam radiation therapy", "hemorrhagic cystitis", "lower urinary tract fibrosis", "pelvic floor muscle damage", "prevention of radiation-induced LUT complications", "radiation cystitis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Female", "Humans", "Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms", "Male", "Pelvic Neoplasms", "Radiation Injuries", "Urethra", "Urinary Bladder"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087922632", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"7102263462": {"Name": "Bosch R.", "AuthorID": "7102263462", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urologic Oncology, UMC Utrecht Cancer Center, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "7006661318": {"Name": "McCloskey K.", "AuthorID": "7006661318", "AffiliationID": "60014295, 60029738", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Dentistry and Biomedical Sciences, Queen's University Belfast"}, "15833857100": {"Name": "Bahl A.", "AuthorID": "15833857100", "AffiliationID": "60170515", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Cancer Institute, University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust"}, "23484235800": {"Name": "Arlandis S.", "AuthorID": "23484235800", "AffiliationID": "60032451", "AffiliationName": "Functional and Reconstructive Urology Section, Hospital Universitari Polit\u00e8cnic La Fe"}, "6506281538": {"Name": "Ockrim J.", "AuthorID": "6506281538", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Female, Functional and Restorative Urology Unit, University College London Hospitals"}, "7004415688": {"Name": "Greenwell T.", "AuthorID": "7004415688", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Female, Functional and Restorative Urology Unit, University College London Hospitals"}, "55044122800": {"Name": "Weiss J.", "AuthorID": "55044122800", "AffiliationID": "60023247", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University"}}}
