A striking and poorly understood feature of this process is \u201czippering,\u201d whereby a fusion point moves directionally along an organ rudiment. Here, we uncover the molecular mechanism underlying zippering during mouse spinal neural tube closure. Fusion is initiated via local activation of integrin \u03b21 and focal anchorage of surface ectoderm cells to a shared point of fibronectin-rich basement membrane, where the neural folds first contact each other. Surface ectoderm cells undergo proximal junction shortening, establishing a transitory semi-rosette-like structure at the zippering point that promotes juxtaposition of cells across the midline enabling fusion propagation. Tissue-specific ablation of integrin \u03b21 abolishes the semi-rosette formation, preventing zippering and causing spina bifida. We propose integrin-mediated anchorage as an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of general relevance for zippering closure of epithelial gaps whose disturbance can produce clinically important birth defects.\u00a9 2020 The AuthorsMol\u00e8 et al. show that integrin-mediated basal anchorage drives epithelial zippering during mouse spinal neural tube closure. This occurs via formation of a multicellular semi-rosette configuration that promotes juxtaposition between opposing surface ectoderm junctions. The loss of integrin halts zippering progression, causing failure of neural tube closure and open spina bifida.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cell adhesion", "epithelial zippering", "extracellular matrix", "fibronectin", "fusion", "gap closure", "integrins", "morphogenesis", "neurulation", "spina bifida"], "IndexKeywords": ["Actomyosin", "Animals", "Cell Fusion", "Embryo, Mammalian", "Epithelial Cells", "Female", "Focal Adhesions", "Integrin beta1", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Morphogenesis", "Neural Crest", "Neural Tube", "Neurulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079337922", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"56680990300": {"Name": "Mol\u00e8 M.A.", "AuthorID": "56680990300", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development & Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "37026041900": {"Name": "Galea G.L.", "AuthorID": "37026041900", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Newlife Birth Defects Research Centre, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "24725761200": {"Name": "Rolo A.", "AuthorID": "24725761200", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Newlife Birth Defects Research Centre, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57201477286": {"Name": "Nychyk O.", "AuthorID": "57201477286", "AffiliationID": "60030662", "AffiliationName": "Neuro-endocrinology/Nutrition, Food Bioscience Department"}, "16303182000": {"Name": "De Castro S.C.", "AuthorID": "16303182000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Newlife Birth Defects Research Centre, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "10539322200": {"Name": "Savery D.", "AuthorID": "10539322200", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Newlife Birth Defects Research Centre, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "35587452100": {"Name": "Greene N.D.E.", "AuthorID": "35587452100", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Newlife Birth Defects Research Centre, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7006634311": {"Name": "Copp A.J.", "AuthorID": "7006634311", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Newlife Birth Defects Research Centre, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57194974717": {"Name": "Weberling A.", "AuthorID": "57194974717", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development & Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "35493223600": {"Name": "F\u00e4ssler R.", "AuthorID": "35493223600", "AffiliationID": "60006070", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry"}, "6506882171": {"Name": "Ybot-Gonz\u00e1lez P.", "AuthorID": "6506882171", "AffiliationID": "60002196", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Neurophysiology, Hospital Virgen de Macarena"}}}
