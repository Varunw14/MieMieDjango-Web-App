As processing speed is known to decline with age, it is possible that changes in speed contribute to the variation in age-related decline found on different tests of executive function. In this study, the effects of age and processing speed on different executive tests in the same group of younger and older adults were investigated. Fifty-nine (n = 28 males and n = 31 females) younger adults (Mage = 21.49; SD = 2.54) and N = 52 (n = 22 males and n = 30 females) older adults (Mage = 72.04; SD = 4.99) were assessed on the following battery of measures: processing speed and the executive functions of dualtasking, inhibition, set-shifting, and updating. Older adults performed significantly worse than younger adults on all executive function tests except dual-tasking. In addition, age, rather than processing speed, predicted executive function performance on executive tests of inhibition, set-shifting, and updating tests. These findings confirm that dual-tasking does not decline with age and the age differences found on tests of inhibition, set-shifting, and updating are not simply explained by processing speed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dual tasking", "Executive function", "Healthy aging", "Processing speed"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074686479", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"]], "AuthorData": {"55589339800": {"Name": "Argiris G.", "AuthorID": "55589339800", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57212061035": {"Name": "MacPherson S.", "AuthorID": "57212061035", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57212992147": {"Name": "Sala S.", "AuthorID": "57212992147", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57214747174": {"Name": "Foley J.", "AuthorID": "57214747174", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
