METHOD: We included participants (n = 1,801) with probable Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia (n = 937), mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 437), and subjective cognitive decline (SCD; n = 427). Main outcomes were CSF \u03b2-amyloid1-42 (A\u03b242), total tau (t-Tau), and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-Tau) levels. Age-corrected 3-way interactions between sex, disease stage (i.e., syndrome diagnosis at baseline), and APOE \u03b54 were tested with linear regression analyses for each outcome measure. In case of significant interactions (p < 0.05), sex differences were further evaluated by stratifying analyses for clinical disease stage and APOE \u03b54 genotype, including age as a covariate. RESULTS: Three-way interactions were significant for t-Tau (p < 0.001) and p-Tau (p < 0.01) but not A\u03b242. In APOE \u03b54 carriers, women showed higher p-Tau concentrations than men in SCD (Cohen d [95% confidence interval]: t-Tau = 0.52 [0.19-0.84], p < 0.001; p-Tau = 0.44 [0.11-0.77] p = 0.004) and MCI (Cohen d [95% CI]: t-Tau = 0.54 [0.28-0.80], p < 0.001; p-Tau = 0.52 [0.26-0.77], p < 0.001) but not in AD dementia. In APOE \u03b54 noncarriers, women showed higher p-Tau concentrations in MCI (Cohen d [95% CI]: t-Tau = 0.49 [0.17-0.80], p = 0.002; p-Tau = 0.47 [0.16-0.78], p = 0.003) and AD dementia (Cohen d [95% CI]: t-Tau = 0.42 [0.19-0.65], p < 0.001; p-Tau = 0.38 [0.15-0.61] p = 0.002) but not in SCD. CONCLUSIONS: Within APOE \u03b54 carriers, sex differences in CSF p-Tau are more evident in early disease stages, whereas for APOE \u03b54 noncarriers, sex differences are more evident in advanced disease stages. These findings suggest that the effect of APOE \u03b54 on sex differences in CSF biomarkers depends on disease stage in AD.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Apolipoprotein E4", "Biomarkers", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Genotype", "Heterozygote", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Peptide Fragments", "Phosphorylation", "Sex Characteristics", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094931124", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57194406847": {"Name": "Babapour Mofrad R.", "AuthorID": "57194406847", "AffiliationID": "60001997, 60022148, 60002746, 60029929, 60008734", "AffiliationName": null}, "57204782423": {"Name": "Tijms B.M.", "AuthorID": "57204782423", "AffiliationID": "60001997, 60022148, 60002746, 60029929, 60008734", "AffiliationName": null}, "57204745168": {"Name": "Scheltens P.", "AuthorID": "57204745168", "AffiliationID": "60001997, 60022148, 60002746, 60029929, 60008734", "AffiliationName": null}, "7102989379": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "7102989379", "AffiliationID": "60001997, 60022148, 60002746, 60029929, 60008734", "AffiliationName": null}, "57204743974": {"Name": "van der Flier W.M.", "AuthorID": "57204743974", "AffiliationID": "60001997, 60022148, 60002746, 60029929, 60008734", "AffiliationName": null}, "22035912000": {"Name": "Sikkes S.A.M.", "AuthorID": "22035912000", "AffiliationID": "60001997, 60022148, 60002746, 60029929, 60008734", "AffiliationName": null}, "57210241893": {"Name": "Teunissen C.E.", "AuthorID": "57210241893", "AffiliationID": "60001997, 60022148, 60002746, 60029929, 60008734", "AffiliationName": null}}}
