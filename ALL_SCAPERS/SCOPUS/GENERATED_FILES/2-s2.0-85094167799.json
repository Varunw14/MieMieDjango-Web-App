However, smart IoT devices also bring various security vulnerabilities. Traditionally, attacks are solved by conventional authentication and authorization schemes, requiring extensive time and computational resources. In addition, it is possible to exploit artificial intelligence (AI) to provide countermeasures while enabling lightweight authentication. In this paper, we explore a solution on modelling a spoofing detection system based on machine learning and we propose a deep learning method using Auto-Extractor/Classifier Neural Network. Our scheme operates on the physical layer without causing computational overhead. Therefore, the lightweight authentication can be achieved and spoofing attacks are well- controlled in IoT scenarios.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Artificial intelligence", "Classification", "CNN", "Deep learning", "Physical layer authentication", "Prototyping", "Software defined radio"], "IndexKeywords": ["Authentication and authorization", "Computational overheads", "Computational resources", "Intelligent authentication", "Intelligent Services", "Internet of Things (IOT)", "Security vulnerabilities", "Spoofing attacks"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094167799", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57201552019": {"Name": "Qiu X.", "AuthorID": "57201552019", "AffiliationID": "60088567", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Information Science and Technology University, School of Information Management"}, "57214289591": {"Name": "Sun X.", "AuthorID": "57214289591", "AffiliationID": "60088567", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Information Science and Technology University, School of Information Management"}, "57219604987": {"Name": "Lit Z.", "AuthorID": "57219604987", "AffiliationID": "60020620", "AffiliationName": "Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, School of Communication and Information Engineering"}, "55846144300": {"Name": "Xu T.", "AuthorID": "55846144300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}}}
