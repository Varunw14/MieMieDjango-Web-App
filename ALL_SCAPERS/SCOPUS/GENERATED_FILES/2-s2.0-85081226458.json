We aimed to describe current practice related to the use of HHFNC on the paediatric wards and HDUs, weaning practices and preferred outcome measures for future research. Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional online survey of UK paediatric consultants or their delegates working on the paediatric wards. Descriptive analysis of their geographical, and organizational characteristics, their specialties, and their level of experience was investigated. Reasons for HHFNC initiation, weaning criteria, patients' characteristics and their primary pathologies were also analysed. Results: Participation of 218 paediatricians from 81 hospitals (Median: 2.7, Range: 1-11) was registered. HHFNC was provided in most of the surveyed hospitals (93%, 75/81). A High Dependency Unit (HDU) was available in 47 hospitals (58%); less than a third of those have a dedicated paediatrician. Decisions around HHFNC were made solely by paediatricians in (75%) of the cases, mostly at hospitals with no HDU compared to those with dedicated HDUs (70.3% VS 36.6, 95%CI:22.6-50.4%, P <.001). HHFNC was reported by nearly two-thirds (68%) of the practitioners who used it on the wards to be as effective or superior to CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) with fewer complications. Failure rate while on HHFNC was identified as the most important outcome measure in any future research followed by the length of need for HHFNC support (37.1, and 28% respectively). Conclusion: This survey showed support for developing paediatric-specific national guidance on the use of HHFNC on the wards. Our list of defined research priorities may help guide further collaborative research efforts in this field.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adjunctive therapy", "Children", "High flow nasal cannula", "Oxygen therapy", "Paediatrics"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081226458", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"57201620370": {"Name": "Hosheh O.", "AuthorID": "57201620370", "AffiliationID": "60022357, 60170285", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Birmingham Children's Hospital, Birmingham Women's and Children's Hospital Foundation Trust"}, "57188621939": {"Name": "Edwards C.T.", "AuthorID": "57188621939", "AffiliationID": "60006866", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Regional Paediatric Respiratory and Cystic Fibrosis Centre, Leeds Children's Hospital, Leeds General Infirmary"}, "6602350620": {"Name": "Ramnarayan P.", "AuthorID": "6602350620", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Children's Acute Transport Service, Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
