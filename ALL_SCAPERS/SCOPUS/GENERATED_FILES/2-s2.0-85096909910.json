For each snapshot, the density of the halo is reduced to a basis function expansion, with interpolation used to recreate the evolution between snapshots. The angular variation of the halo density is described by spherical harmonics, and the radial variation either by biorthonormal basis functions adapted to handle truncated haloes or by splines. High fidelity orbit reconstructions are attainable using either method with similar computational expense. We quantify how the error in the reconstructed orbits varies with expansion order and snapshot spacing. Despite the many possible biorthonormal expansions, it is hard to beat a conventional Hernquist-Ostriker expansion with a moderate number of terms (15 radial and 6 angular). As two applications of the developed machinery, we assess the impact of the time-dependence of the potential on (i) the orbits of Milky Way satellites and (ii) planes of satellites as observed in the Milky Way and other nearby galaxies. Time evolution over the last 5 Gyr introduces an uncertainty in the Milky Way satellites' orbital parameters of \u223c 15%, comparable to that induced by the observational errors or the uncertainty in the present-day Milky Way potential. On average, planes of satellites grow at similar rates in evolving and time-independent potentials. There can be more, or less, growth in the plane's thickness, if the plane becomes less, or more, aligned with the major or minor axis of the evolving halo.", "AuthorKeywords": ["galaxies: haloes", "galaxies: kinematics and dynamics", "galaxies: structure", "methods: numerical"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096909910", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57195339746": {"Name": "Sanders J.L.", "AuthorID": "57195339746", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57203605863": {"Name": "Lilley E.J.", "AuthorID": "57203605863", "AffiliationID": "60019598, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge"}, "23029400500": {"Name": "Vasiliev E.", "AuthorID": "23029400500", "AffiliationID": "60009114", "AffiliationName": "Lebedev Physical Institute"}, "26642857200": {"Name": "Wyn Evans N.", "AuthorID": "26642857200", "AffiliationID": "60019598, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge"}, "24173404700": {"Name": "Erkal D.", "AuthorID": "24173404700", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences, University of Surrey"}}}
