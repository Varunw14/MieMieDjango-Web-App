Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a common indolent B\u2010cell lymphoma that can transform into the more aggressive transformed FL (tFL). However, the molecular process driving this transformation is uncertain. In this work, we aimed to identify microRNA (miRNA)\u2010binding sites recurrently mutated in follicular lymphoma patients, as well as in transformed FL patients. Using whole\u2010genome sequencing data from FL tumors, we discovered 544 mutations located in bioinformatically predicted microRNA\u2010binding sites. We then studied these specific regions using targeted sequencing in a cohort of 55 FL patients, found 16 recurrent mutations, and identified a further 69 variants. After filtering for QC, we identified 21 genes with mutated miRNA\u2010binding sites that were also enriched for B\u2010cell\u2010associated genes by Gene Ontology. Over 40% of mutations identified in these genes were present exclusively in tFL patients. We validated the predicted miRNA\u2010binding sites of five of the genes by luciferase assay and demonstrated that the identified mutations in BCL2 and EZH2 genes impaired the binding efficiency of miR\u20105008 and miR\u2010144 and regulated the endogenous levels of messenger RNA (mRNA).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diffuse large B\u2010cell lymphoma (DLBCL)", "Follicular lymphoma (FL)", "MicroRNA", "Mutation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096327213", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"55960826400": {"Name": "Larrea E.", "AuthorID": "55960826400", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University"}, "24074327000": {"Name": "Fernandez\u2010mercado M.", "AuthorID": "24074327000", "AffiliationID": "60033320", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Navarra"}, "53982815600": {"Name": "Goicoechea I.", "AuthorID": "53982815600", "AffiliationID": "60032489", "AffiliationName": "Multiple Myeloma Group, Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica Aplicada (CIMA)"}, "13405551500": {"Name": "Lawrie C.H.", "AuthorID": "13405551500", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "36026665000": {"Name": "Guerra\u2010assun\u00e7\u00e3o J.A.", "AuthorID": "36026665000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London (UCL)"}, "55969138800": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "55969138800", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "36930840000": {"Name": "Okosun J.", "AuthorID": "36930840000", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57202617382": {"Name": "Fitzgibbon J.", "AuthorID": "57202617382", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "6603813220": {"Name": "Gaafar A.", "AuthorID": "6603813220", "AffiliationID": "60029271", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Cruces Hospital"}, "6505974161": {"Name": "Ceberio I.", "AuthorID": "6505974161", "AffiliationID": "60007263", "AffiliationName": "Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario Donostia"}, "57219961001": {"Name": "Lobo C.", "AuthorID": "57219961001", "AffiliationID": "60007263", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Hospital Universitario Donostia"}, "7004081426": {"Name": "Enright A.J.", "AuthorID": "7004081426", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge"}}}
