In this study, we aimed to test the potential value of auditory stimulation for improving gait in chronic stroke patients by inducing alterations of the frequency spectra of walking sounds via a sound system that selectively amplifies and equalizes the signal in order to produce distorted auditory feedback. Twenty-two patients with lower extremity paresis were exposed to real-time alterations of their footstep sounds while walking. Changes in body perception, emotion, and gait were quantified. Our results suggest that by altering footsteps sounds, several gait parameters can be modified in terms of left\u2013right foot asymmetry. We observed that augmenting low-frequency bands or amplifying the natural walking sounds led to a reduction in the asymmetry index of stance and stride times, whereas it inverted the asymmetry pattern in heel\u2013ground exerted force. By contrast, augmenting high-frequency bands led to opposite results. These gait changes might be related to updating of internal forward models, signaling the need for adjustment of the motor system to reduce the perceived discrepancies between predicted\u2013actual sensory feedbacks. Our findings may have the potential to enhance gait awareness in stroke patients and other clinical conditions, supporting gait rehabilitation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["auditory feedback", "forward model", "gait rehabilitation", "stroke"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Feedback, Sensory", "Female", "Gait", "Gait Disorders, Neurologic", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pilot Projects", "Stroke Rehabilitation", "Treatment Outcome", "Walking"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084783579", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["History and Philosophy of Science", "ARTS", "1207"]], "AuthorData": {"57197874771": {"Name": "Gomez-Andres A.", "AuthorID": "57197874771", "AffiliationID": "60001576", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cognition, Development and Educational Psychology, University of Barcelona"}, "55652673700": {"Name": "Grau-S\u00e1nchez J.", "AuthorID": "55652673700", "AffiliationID": "60023020", "AffiliationName": "Escola Universit\u00e0ria d'Infermeria i Ter\u00e0pia Ocupacional de Terrassa (EUIT), Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}, "35234806900": {"Name": "Rodriguez-Fornells A.", "AuthorID": "35234806900", "AffiliationID": "60032907", "AffiliationName": "Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies, ICREA"}, "7005169412": {"Name": "Duarte E.", "AuthorID": "7005169412", "AffiliationID": "121438183", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Hospitals del Mar i l'Esperan\u00e7a"}, "23569030500": {"Name": "Tajadura-Jim\u00e9nez A.", "AuthorID": "23569030500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre (UCLIC), University College London"}}}
