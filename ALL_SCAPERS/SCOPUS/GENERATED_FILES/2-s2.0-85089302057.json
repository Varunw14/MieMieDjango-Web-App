In addition to pharmacological therapy, catheter ablation is an effective strategy in restoring and maintaining sinus rhythm. However, ablation is not without risk, and AF recurs in a significant proportion of patients. Non-invasive, easily accessible markers or indices that could stratify patients depending on the likelihood of a successful outcome following ablation would allow us to select the most appropriate patients for the procedure, reducing the AF recurrence rate and exposure to potentially life-threatening risks. There has been much attention paid to Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) and N-Terminal prohormone of Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP) as possible predictive markers of successful ablation. Several studies have demonstrated an association between higher pre-ablation levels of these peptides, and a greater likelihood of AF recurrence. Therefore, there may be a role for measuring brain natriuretic peptides levels when selecting patients for catheter ablation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ablation", "Atrial Fibrillation (AF)", "Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP)", "Catheter ablation", "N-terminal BNP", "Recurrence"], "IndexKeywords": ["Atrial Fibrillation", "Biomarkers", "Catheter Ablation", "Humans", "Natriuretic Peptide, Brain", "Peptide Fragments"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089302057", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"57216075809": {"Name": "Papageorgiou N.", "AuthorID": "57216075809", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "15769947600": {"Name": "Provid\u00eancia R.", "AuthorID": "15769947600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}, "57190854854": {"Name": "Lim W.Y.", "AuthorID": "57190854854", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Electrophysiology Department, Barts Heart Centre, St. Bartholomew\u2019s Hospital"}, "16063029200": {"Name": "Chow A.W.", "AuthorID": "16063029200", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Electrophysiology Department, Barts Heart Centre, St. Bartholomew\u2019s Hospital"}, "7201390233": {"Name": "Schilling R.J.", "AuthorID": "7201390233", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Electrophysiology Department, Barts Heart Centre, St. Bartholomew\u2019s Hospital"}, "6603130488": {"Name": "Lambiase P.D.", "AuthorID": "6603130488", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "57195283803": {"Name": "Falconer D.", "AuthorID": "57195283803", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57196056137": {"Name": "Wongwarawipat T.", "AuthorID": "57196056137", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free Hospital"}, "57189265073": {"Name": "Tousoulis D.", "AuthorID": "57189265073", "AffiliationID": "60067083", "AffiliationName": "1FstCardiology Department, Athens University Medical School"}}}
