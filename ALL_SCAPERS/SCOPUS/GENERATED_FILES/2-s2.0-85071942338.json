To address the challenges, this article develops a graph deep learning framework to predict large-scale network traffic flow with high accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, we model the dynamics of the traffic flow on a road network as an irreducible and aperiodic Markov chain on a directed graph. Based on the representation, a novel spatial\u2013temporal graph inception residual network (STGI-ResNet) is developed for network-based traffic prediction. This model integrates multiple spatial\u2013temporal graph convolution (STGC) operators, residual learning, and the inception structure. The proposed STGC operators can adaptively extract spatial\u2013temporal features from multiple traffic periodicities while preserving the topology information of the road network. The proposed STGI-ResNet inherits the advantages of residual learning and inception structure to improve prediction accuracy, accelerate the model training process, and reduce difficult parameter tuning efforts. The computational complexity is linearly related to the number of road links, which enables citywide short-term traffic prediction. Experiments using a car-hailing traffic data set at 10-, 30-, and 60-min intervals for a large road network in a Chinese city shows that the proposed model outperformed various state-of-the-art baselines for short-term network traffic flow prediction.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Computational costs", "Directed network topology", "Large-scale network", "Learning frameworks", "Network traffic flow", "Short-term traffic flow", "Short-term traffic forecasting", "Topology information"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071942338", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"]], "AuthorData": {"57196203282": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "57196203282", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Systems Engineering, National University of Defense Technology"}, "35200522100": {"Name": "Cheng T.", "AuthorID": "35200522100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "SpaceTimeLab, Department of Civil Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "57201004030": {"Name": "Ren Y.", "AuthorID": "57201004030", "AffiliationID": "60022422", "AffiliationName": "Qingdao Collaborative Innovation Centre of Marine Science and Technology, College of Information Science and Engineering, Ocean University of China"}}}
