Methods: Discrepant findings from a series of 106 patients undergoing same-day 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET/CT and PET/MRI were reviewed. Phantom studies explored the potential for PET acquisition time to contribute to discrepancy. Results: There were 14 discrepant cases, 5 (35.7%) of which related to PET/MRI acquisitions that had been extended to 10 min. Three of these five cases proved to be falsely positive. Phantom studies showed greater contrast recovery and signal to noise ratio for 10-min PET/MRI acquisitions compared to 2-min acquisitions using PET/CT. There were no discrepancies when PET/CT showed disseminated disease (P = 0.036). Conclusions: Extended PET/MRI acquisitions used to accommodate multiple MRI sequences may be associated with false-positive findings compared to PET/CT. PET/MRI is more likely to have incremental value when the prior probability for disseminated disease is low.", "AuthorKeywords": ["comparative study", "neoplasms/diagnostic imaging", "PET/CT", "PET/MRI"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083536125", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57200316797": {"Name": "Oh G.", "AuthorID": "57200316797", "AffiliationID": "60025258", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Princess Alexandra Hospital"}, "11238841800": {"Name": "Jeavons S.", "AuthorID": "11238841800", "AffiliationID": "60025258", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Princess Alexandra Hospital"}, "56957815200": {"Name": "Law P.", "AuthorID": "56957815200", "AffiliationID": "60025258", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Princess Alexandra Hospital"}, "15070960900": {"Name": "Ngai S.", "AuthorID": "15070960900", "AffiliationID": "60025258", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Princess Alexandra Hospital"}, "57216448479": {"Name": "Yu C.", "AuthorID": "57216448479", "AffiliationID": "60025258", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Princess Alexandra Hospital"}, "16948025200": {"Name": "Miles K.A.", "AuthorID": "16948025200", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "57216448910": {"Name": "O\u2019Mahoney E.", "AuthorID": "57216448910", "AffiliationID": "60025258", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Technology Services, Princess Alexandra Hospital"}, "7004150403": {"Name": "McGill G.", "AuthorID": "7004150403", "AffiliationID": "60025258", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Technology Services, Princess Alexandra Hospital"}}}
