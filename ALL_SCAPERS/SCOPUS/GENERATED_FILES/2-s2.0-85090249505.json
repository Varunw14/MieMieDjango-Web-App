This is partially due to an incomplete understanding of the role of autophagy in the different stages of cancer, and also to an incomplete assessment of potential drug targets in the autophagy pathway. While drug discovery efforts are on-going to target enzymes involved in the initiation phase of the autophagosome, e.g., unc51-like autophagy activating kinase (ULK)1/2, vacuolar protein sorting 34 (Vps34), and autophagy-related (ATG)7, we propose that the cysteine protease ATG4B is a bona fide drug target for the development of anti-cancer treatments. In this review, we highlight some of the recent advances in our understanding of the role of ATG4B in autophagy and its relevance to cancer, and perform a critical evaluation of ATG4B as a druggable cancer target.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ATG4", "autophagy", "biomarker", "drug screening", "pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)", "screening assay", "small molecule compound"], "IndexKeywords": ["Autophagy", "Autophagy-Related Proteins", "Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Proliferation", "Cysteine Endopeptidases", "Drug Discovery", "Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor", "Humans", "Neoplasm Invasiveness", "Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090249505", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57204756458": {"Name": "Agrotis A.", "AuthorID": "57204756458", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "6603482374": {"Name": "Ketteler R.", "AuthorID": "6603482374", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}}}
