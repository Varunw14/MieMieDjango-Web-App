It is also a fulcrum for discourses about urban failure, broken communities, widening urban inequality, and insecurity. Recent tower block disasters, from the Grenfell Tower fire in London to high-rise collapses in Nairobi, have intensified such debates. In this introduction to the theme section, we explore \u201ctower block failure\u201d as both event and discourse. Engaging with scholarship on global urbanism, ver-ticality, and failure as a generative force, we highlight the particular discursive, social, political, and material constellations of \u201cfailure\u201d as it manifests in relation to tower blocks. We propose that exploring what failure sets in motion\u2014following what failure does, rather than what it means\u2014can help inform our understanding of urban transformation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cities", "Community", "Failure", "Global urbanism", "Grenfell", "Tower blocks", "Urban", "Verticality"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082099967", "SubjectAreas": [["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"]], "AuthorData": {"57201392802": {"Name": "Smith C.", "AuthorID": "57201392802", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "University of Manchester"}, "56896068600": {"Name": "Woodcraft S.", "AuthorID": "56896068600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL"}}}
