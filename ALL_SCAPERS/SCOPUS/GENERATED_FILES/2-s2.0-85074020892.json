However, there is limited literature regarding factors that affect progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with GEP NENs treated with LAN. Methods: We identified a total of 191 treatment-naive patients with advanced GEP NENs and positive SSTR uptake on imaging (Octreoscan or 68Gallium DOTATATE Positron Emission Tomography [68GaPET]) who received first-line LAN monotherapy, albeit at various starting doses (60, 90 or 120 mg/month). A group of 102 patients who initiated treatment at the standard dose of 120 mg/month were included in the study and further evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses to identify predictors of PFS. Results: The location of tumour primary was in the small bowel in 63 (62%), pancreas in 31 (30%) and colon/rectum in 8 patients (8%). The tumours were well-differentiated, and the majority were grade 1 (52%), or 2 (38%). About 60% of cases had progressive disease at the time of treatment initiation. Most patients with available pretreatment nuclear medicine imaging (Octreoscan or 68Ga PET) had a Krenning score of 3 (44%) or 4 (50%). The median PFS for the entire cohort was 19 months (95% CI 12, 26 months). The univariate analysis demonstrated that grade 2 tumours, progressive disease at baseline and metastatic liver disease were associated with a significantly shorter PFS, while other evaluated variables did not affect PFS at a statistically significant level. However, at multivariate analysis only the tumour grade remained statistically significant. Conclusions: The current study showed that, of many evaluated variables, only the tumour grade was predictive of PFS duration and this should be considered during patient selection for treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Lanreotide autogel", "Neuroendocrine neoplasm", "Neuroendocrine tumour", "Somatostatin analogue"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074020892", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"55961896300": {"Name": "Laskaratos F.M.", "AuthorID": "55961896300", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Gastroenterology, Neuroendocrine Tumour Unit, ENETS Centre of Excellence, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35975563100": {"Name": "Armeni E.", "AuthorID": "35975563100", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Gastroenterology, Neuroendocrine Tumour Unit, ENETS Centre of Excellence, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57204597414": {"Name": "Megapanou M.", "AuthorID": "57204597414", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Gastroenterology, Neuroendocrine Tumour Unit, ENETS Centre of Excellence, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57201254728": {"Name": "Papantoniou D.", "AuthorID": "57201254728", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Gastroenterology, Neuroendocrine Tumour Unit, ENETS Centre of Excellence, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57202014818": {"Name": "Hayes A.R.", "AuthorID": "57202014818", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Gastroenterology, Neuroendocrine Tumour Unit, ENETS Centre of Excellence, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57204601254": {"Name": "Phillips E.", "AuthorID": "57204601254", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Gastroenterology, Neuroendocrine Tumour Unit, ENETS Centre of Excellence, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57211454666": {"Name": "Furnace M.", "AuthorID": "57211454666", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Gastroenterology, Neuroendocrine Tumour Unit, ENETS Centre of Excellence, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55649892900": {"Name": "Mandair D.", "AuthorID": "55649892900", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Gastroenterology, Neuroendocrine Tumour Unit, ENETS Centre of Excellence, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55908628800": {"Name": "Caplin M.", "AuthorID": "55908628800", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Gastroenterology, Neuroendocrine Tumour Unit, ENETS Centre of Excellence, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "16033469000": {"Name": "Toumpanakis C.", "AuthorID": "16033469000", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Gastroenterology, Neuroendocrine Tumour Unit, ENETS Centre of Excellence, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57211458150": {"Name": "Shah H.", "AuthorID": "57211458150", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "UCL Medical School"}, "57211462585": {"Name": "Kamieniarz L.", "AuthorID": "57211462585", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "UCL Medical School"}, "57211454137": {"Name": "Kousteni M.", "AuthorID": "57211454137", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "UCL Medical School"}, "35219135500": {"Name": "Navalkissoor S.", "AuthorID": "35219135500", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "23469150700": {"Name": "Gnanasegaran G.", "AuthorID": "23469150700", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55682302100": {"Name": "von Stempel C.", "AuthorID": "55682302100", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "54916621100": {"Name": "Luong T.V.", "AuthorID": "54916621100", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Academic Centre for Cellular Pathology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7402110302": {"Name": "Watkins J.", "AuthorID": "7402110302", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Academic Centre for Cellular Pathology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
