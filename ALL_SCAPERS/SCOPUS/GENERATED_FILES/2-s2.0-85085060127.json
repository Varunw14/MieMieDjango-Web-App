LRRK2 is expressed in both neurons and glia in the central nervous system, but its physiological function(s) in each of these cell types is uncertain. Through sequential screens, we report a functional interaction between LRRK2 and Clathrin adaptor protein complex 2 (AP2). Analysis of LRRK2 KO tissue revealed a significant dysregulation of AP2 complex components, suggesting LRRK2 may act upstream of AP2. In line with this hypothesis, expression of LRRK2 was found to modify recruitment and phosphorylation of AP2. Furthermore, expression of LRRK2 containing the R1441C pathogenic mutation resulted in impaired clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). A decrease in activity-dependent synaptic vesicle endocytosis was also observed in neurons harboring an endogenous R1441C LRRK2 mutation. Alongside LRRK2, several PD-associated genes intersect with membrane-trafficking pathways. To investigate the genetic association between Clathrin-trafficking and PD, we used polygenetic risk profiling from IPDGC genome wide association studies (GWAS) datasets. Clathrin-dependent endocytosis genes were found to be associated with PD across multiple cohorts, suggesting common variants at these loci represent a cumulative risk factor for disease. Taken together, these findings suggest CME is a LRRK2-mediated, PD relevant pathway.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clathrin-mediated endocytosis", "LRRK2", "Parkinson's disease", "Risk factor"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085060127", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"]], "AuthorData": {"57189748019": {"Name": "Heaton G.R.", "AuthorID": "57189748019", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "26654791000": {"Name": "Landeck N.", "AuthorID": "26654791000", "AffiliationID": "60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health"}, "27467539800": {"Name": "Mamais A.", "AuthorID": "27467539800", "AffiliationID": "60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health"}, "55630773200": {"Name": "Nalls M.A.", "AuthorID": "55630773200", "AffiliationID": "118431800", "AffiliationName": "Data Tecnica International"}, "21834356900": {"Name": "Kumaran R.", "AuthorID": "21834356900", "AffiliationID": "60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health"}, "6507543969": {"Name": "Beilina A.", "AuthorID": "6507543969", "AffiliationID": "60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health"}, "57191074830": {"Name": "Pellegrini L.", "AuthorID": "57191074830", "AffiliationID": "60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health"}, "7006533543": {"Name": "Cookson M.R.", "AuthorID": "7006533543", "AffiliationID": "60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health"}, "57188567996": {"Name": "Nixon-Abell J.", "AuthorID": "57188567996", "AffiliationID": "60103296, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge"}, "55959808500": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "55959808500", "AffiliationID": "60006577", "AffiliationName": "Mass spectrometry Facility, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health"}, "7102029918": {"Name": "Harvey K.", "AuthorID": "7102029918", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
