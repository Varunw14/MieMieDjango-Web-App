Steel plates coated with a commercial solvent-based thin intumescent coating were exposed to well-defined and highly-repeatable heating conditions in accordance with the H-TRIS test method. Experimental results emphasise that the swelling process and the resulting swelled thickness govern the thermo-physical response of intumescent coatings, thus their effectiveness. During swelling, the coated steel asymptotically tends to the temperature range 300\u2013350 \u00b0C, regardless of the heating condition or DFT. Thermo-gravimetric analysis demonstrates that the coating undergoes the swelling reaction at this temperature range. Once the swelling process is completed, the steel temperature increases above 350 \u00b0C. The steel temperature acts as an indicator of the swelling process, as the reaction occurs near the steel-coating interface. The intumescent coating swells and insulates the steel substrate by displacing the already-swelled coating towards the direction of the heat source. Aiming at predicting the swelling of intumescent coatings, empirical correlations are derived: the swelling rate is governed by the heating conditions and the maximum swelled thickness is governed by the initial DFT.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fire safety", "Fire testing", "H-TRIS", "Heat transfer", "Heating conditions", "Initial thickness", "Intumescent coatings", "Steel structures", "Swelling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dry film thickness", "Empirical correlations", "Experimental methodology", "Heating conditions", "Initial thickness", "Intumescent coating", "Steel temperatures", "Thermo-physical response"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086338506", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57193860824": {"Name": "Lucherini A.", "AuthorID": "57193860824", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil Engineering, The University of Queensland"}, "56903753000": {"Name": "Hidalgo J.P.", "AuthorID": "56903753000", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil Engineering, The University of Queensland"}, "36461450300": {"Name": "Maluk C.", "AuthorID": "36461450300", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil Engineering, The University of Queensland"}, "7004558676": {"Name": "Torero J.L.", "AuthorID": "7004558676", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental & Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
