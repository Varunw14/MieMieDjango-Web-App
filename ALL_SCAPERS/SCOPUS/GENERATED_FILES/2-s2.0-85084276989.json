Objectives \u00e2In this post hoc analysis of patients receiving tertiary prophylaxis for approximately 1 year, the relationship between estimated FVIII levels and reported bleeds was investigated to predict the potential for zero bleeds. Methods \u00e2Sixty-three patients (median [range] age, 28 [7-59] years) with severe hemophilia A (229 bleeds) were included. FVIII levels at time of each bleed were estimated from single-dose individual pharmacokinetics. The highest estimated FVIII level at which patients experienced a bleed was considered the potentially effective trough level for that bleed type. Kaplan-Meier estimates of proportions of patients with no bleeds above certain estimated FVIII levels were determined. Those not experiencing a bleed in the trial were assumed to have a bleed at 0 IU/dL (pragmatic approach) or at their median trough level (conservative approach). Results \u00e2Kaplan-Meier estimates based on pragmatic approach predicted zero all bleeds, joint bleeds, and spontaneous joint bleeds in 1 year in 40, 43, and 63% of patients, respectively, when the potentially effective trough FVIII level was set at 1 IU/dL. Between 1 and 10 IU/dL, every 1 IU/dL rise in estimated FVIII level was associated with an additional 2% of patients having zero all bleeds. Conclusion \u00e2This post hoc analysis confirms benefits with trough levels of approximately 1 to 3 IU/dL in most patients starting tertiary prophylaxis; prophylaxis with higher trough levels may help patients to achieve zero bleeds.", "AuthorKeywords": ["coagulation factors", "factor VIII", "hemophilia A/B", "pharmacodynamics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Canada", "Child", "Europe", "Factor VIII", "Hemarthrosis", "Hemophilia A", "Hemostasis", "Hemostatics", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Models, Biological", "Risk Factors", "Severity of Illness Index", "Tertiary Prevention", "United States", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084276989", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"57193134405": {"Name": "Chowdary P.", "AuthorID": "57193134405", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Katharine Dormandy Haemophilia and Thrombosis Centre, Royal Free London Nhs Foundation Trust"}, "8156047300": {"Name": "Fischer K.", "AuthorID": "8156047300", "AffiliationID": "60015874, 60032724", "AffiliationName": "Van Creveldkliniek, Department of Hematology, University Medical Center"}, "7402500907": {"Name": "Collins P.W.", "AuthorID": "7402500907", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, Cardiff University"}, "57216683699": {"Name": "Cotterill A.", "AuthorID": "57216683699", "AffiliationID": "115776717", "AffiliationName": "Baxalta Innovations GmbH, A Member of the Takeda Group of Companies"}, "9846202200": {"Name": "Wolfsegger M.", "AuthorID": "9846202200", "AffiliationID": "115776717", "AffiliationName": "Baxalta Innovations GmbH, A Member of the Takeda Group of Companies"}, "13102650700": {"Name": "Engl W.", "AuthorID": "13102650700", "AffiliationID": "115776717", "AffiliationName": "Baxalta Innovations GmbH, A Member of the Takeda Group of Companies"}, "7004710808": {"Name": "Konkle B.A.", "AuthorID": "7004710808", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Washington"}, "7004973817": {"Name": "Blanchette V.", "AuthorID": "7004973817", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Division of Haematology/Oncology, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto"}, "6603841700": {"Name": "Pipe S.W.", "AuthorID": "6603841700", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics and Pathology, University of Michigan"}, "55145811700": {"Name": "Berntorp E.", "AuthorID": "55145811700", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Translational Medicine and Centre for Thrombosis and Haemostasis, Lund University"}, "35741930800": {"Name": "Spotts G.", "AuthorID": "35741930800", "AffiliationID": "115753111", "AffiliationName": "Baxalta Us Inc, A Member of the Takeda Group of Companies"}}}
