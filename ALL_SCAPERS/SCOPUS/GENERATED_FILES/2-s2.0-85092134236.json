Emerging evidence supports a protective role for this activity in acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Herein, we examined this activity in RARE-LacZ transgenic mice and by RARE-Luciferase reporter assays in CD cells, and investigated how this activity responds to neurotransmitters and mediators of kidney injury. In RARE-LacZ mice, Adriamycin-induced heavy albuminuria was associated with reduced RA/RAR activity in CD cells. In cultured CD cells, RA/RAR activity was repressed by acetylcholine, albumin, aldosterone, angiotensin II, high glucose, cisplatin and lipopolysaccharide, but was induced by aristolochic acid I, calcitonin gene-related peptide, endothelin-1, gentamicin, norepinephrine and vasopressin. Compared with age-matched normal human CD cells, CD-derived renal cystic epithelial cells from patients with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) had significantly lower RA/RAR activity. Synthetic RAR agonist RA-568 was more potent than RA in rescuing RA/RAR activity repressed by albumin, high glucose, angiotensin II, aldosterone, cisplatin and lipopolysaccharide. Hence, RA/RAR in CD cells is a convergence point of regulation by neurotransmitters and mediators of kidney injury, and may be a novel therapeutic target.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acetylcholine", "Albumins", "Aldosterone", "Angiotensin II", "Animals", "Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide", "Cell Line", "Cisplatin", "Endothelin-1", "Female", "Glucose", "Humans", "Kidney Diseases", "Kidney Tubules, Collecting", "Lipopolysaccharides", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Receptors, Retinoic Acid", "Tretinoin", "Vasopressins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092134236", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57219315734": {"Name": "Papadimitriou A.", "AuthorID": "57219315734", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Renal Sciences and Integrative Chinese Medicine Laboratory, Department of Inflammation Biology, School of Immunology and Microbial Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King\u2019s College London"}, "7102422850": {"Name": "Noor M.", "AuthorID": "7102422850", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Renal Sciences and Integrative Chinese Medicine Laboratory, Department of Inflammation Biology, School of Immunology and Microbial Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King\u2019s College London"}, "7005100278": {"Name": "Hendry B.M.", "AuthorID": "7005100278", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Renal Sciences and Integrative Chinese Medicine Laboratory, Department of Inflammation Biology, School of Immunology and Microbial Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King\u2019s College London"}, "7403743653": {"Name": "Xu Q.", "AuthorID": "7403743653", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Renal Sciences and Integrative Chinese Medicine Laboratory, Department of Inflammation Biology, School of Immunology and Microbial Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King\u2019s College London"}, "56265818100": {"Name": "Romagnani P.", "AuthorID": "56265818100", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Biomedical Sciences, University of Florence"}, "23033020100": {"Name": "Angelotti M.L.", "AuthorID": "23033020100", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Biomedical Sciences, University of Florence"}, "7103307019": {"Name": "Corcoran J.", "AuthorID": "7103307019", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "The Wolfson Centre for Age-Related Diseases, King\u2019s College London"}, "57219315448": {"Name": "Raby K.", "AuthorID": "57219315448", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "University College London, UCL Centre for Nephrology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "35395923900": {"Name": "Wilson P.D.", "AuthorID": "35395923900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "University College London, UCL Centre for Nephrology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "54393761000": {"Name": "Li J.", "AuthorID": "54393761000", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Queensland"}, "57217778667": {"Name": "Fraser D.", "AuthorID": "57217778667", "AffiliationID": "60170147", "AffiliationName": "Wales Kidney Research Unit"}, "6602614925": {"Name": "Piedagnel R.", "AuthorID": "6602614925", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60158002, 60000905, 60014254", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health and Medical Research (INSERM), Unit\u00e9 Mixte de Recherche (UMR)-S1155, Tenon Hospital, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s"}}}
