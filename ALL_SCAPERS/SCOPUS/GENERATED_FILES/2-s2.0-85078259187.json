Here, visible\u2013near-infrared and self-powered phototransistors based on spatially bandgap-graded MoS2(1\u2212x)Se2x alloys, synthesized by a simple and controllable chemical solution deposition method, are reported. The graded bandgaps, arising from the spatial grading of Se composition and thickness within a single domain, are tuned from 1.83 to 1.73 eV, leading to the formation of a homojunction with a built-in electric field. Consequently, a strong and sensitive gate-modulated photovoltaic effect is demonstrated, enabling the homojunction phototransistors at zero bias to deliver a photoresponsivity of 311 mA W\u22121, a specific detectivity up to ~ 1011 Jones, and an on/off ratio up to ~ 104. Remarkably, when illuminated by the lights ranging from 405 to 808 nm, the biased devices yield a champion photoresponsivity of 191.5 A W\u22121, a specific detectivity up to ~ 1012 Jones, a photoconductive gain of 106\u2013107, and a photoresponsive time in the order of ~ 50 ms. These results provide a simple and competitive solution to the bandgap engineering of two-dimensional materials for device applications without the need for p\u2013n junctions.[Figure not available: see fulltext.].", "AuthorKeywords": ["Graded bandgaps", "Homojunctions", "Phototransistors", "Self-powered", "Transition metal dichalcogenides"], "IndexKeywords": ["Band gap engineering", "Built-in electric fields", "Chemical solution deposition method", "Homo-junctions", "Photoconductive gains", "Self-powered", "Transition metal dichalcogenides", "Two-dimensional materials"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078259187", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57200394975": {"Name": "Xu H.", "AuthorID": "57200394975", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57209525319": {"Name": "Liu W.", "AuthorID": "57209525319", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "57218466874": {"Name": "Li X.", "AuthorID": "57218466874", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "10141185300": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "10141185300", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Fundamental and Frontier Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "15765485000": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "15765485000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57013600500": {"Name": "Zhu J.", "AuthorID": "57013600500", "AffiliationID": "60010432", "AffiliationName": "School of Energy, Soochow Institute for Energy and Materials Innovations, and Key Laboratory of Advanced Carbon Materials and Wearable Energy Technologies of Jiangsu Province, Soochow University"}, "7102849239": {"Name": "Zou G.", "AuthorID": "7102849239", "AffiliationID": "60010432", "AffiliationName": "School of Energy, Soochow Institute for Energy and Materials Innovations, and Key Laboratory of Advanced Carbon Materials and Wearable Energy Technologies of Jiangsu Province, Soochow University"}, "57195679838": {"Name": "Li C.", "AuthorID": "57195679838", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Fundamental and Frontier Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "56026031000": {"Name": "Ryu G.H.", "AuthorID": "56026031000", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, University of Oxford"}, "57092353100": {"Name": "Xu W.", "AuthorID": "57092353100", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, University of Oxford"}, "55163531500": {"Name": "Warner J.H.", "AuthorID": "55163531500", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, University of Oxford"}, "56328578400": {"Name": "Han X.", "AuthorID": "56328578400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57198560184": {"Name": "Guo Z.", "AuthorID": "57198560184", "AffiliationID": "60114494, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Zhejiang Institute of Research and Innovation, The University of Hong Kong"}}}
