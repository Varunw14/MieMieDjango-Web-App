Most preclinical trials utilize bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (bMscs), although this is not without isolation and expansion difficulties. The aim of this study was: to compare the characteristics of bMscs and adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AdMscs) from juvenile, adult, and ovarectomized (oVX) rats; and to assess the effect of human parathyroid hormone (hpTH) 1-34 on their osteogenic potential and migration to stromal cell-derived factor-1 (sDF-1). Methods cells were isolated from the adipose and bone marrow of juvenile, adult, and previously oVX Wistar rats, and were characterized with flow cytometry, proliferation assays, osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation, and migration to sDF-1. experiments were repeated with and without intermittent hpTH 1-34. Results Juvenile and adult Mscs demonstrated significantly increased osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation and superior migration towards sDF-1 compared with oVX groups; this was the case for AdMscs and bMscs equally. parathyroid hormone (pTH) increased parameters of osteogenic differentiation and migration to sDF-1. This was significant for all cell types, although it had the most significant effect on cells derived from oVX animals. bMscs from all groups showed increased mineralization and migration to sDF-1 compared with AdMscs. Conclusion Juvenile Mscs showed significantly greater migration to sDF-1 and significantly greater osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation compared with cells from osteopenic rats; this was true for bMscs and AdMscs. The addition of pTH increased these characteristics, with the most significant effect on cells derived from oVX animals, further illustrating possible clinical application of both pTH and Mscs in bone regenerative therapies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adipose", "Bone marrow", "Mesenchymal stem cell", "Parathyroid hormone"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071733111", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"57207710291": {"Name": "Osagie-Clouard L.", "AuthorID": "57207710291", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Sciences, Royal National orthopaedic Hospital"}, "57206307303": {"Name": "Blunn G.", "AuthorID": "57206307303", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Sciences, Royal National orthopaedic Hospital"}, "6603029220": {"Name": "Coathup M.", "AuthorID": "6603029220", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Sciences, Royal National orthopaedic Hospital"}, "57193155068": {"Name": "Sanghani-Kerai A.", "AuthorID": "57193155068", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Sciences, Royal National orthopaedic Hospital"}, "26429775100": {"Name": "Meeson R.", "AuthorID": "26429775100", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Sciences, Royal National orthopaedic Hospital"}, "7004395420": {"Name": "Briggs T.", "AuthorID": "7004395420", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Sciences, Royal National orthopaedic Hospital"}}}
