NMR in Biomedicine published by John Wiley & Sons LtdNoninvasive measurements of liver perfusion and fibrosis in cirrhotic small animals can help develop treatments for haemodynamic complications of liver disease. Here, we measure liver perfusion in cirrhotic rodents using flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery arterial spin labelling (FAIR ASL), evaluating agreement with previously validated caval subtraction phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PCMRI) total liver blood flow (TLBF). Baseline differences in cirrhotic rodents and the haemodynamic effects of acute inflammation were investigated using FAIR ASL and tissue T1. Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (nine bile duct ligated [BDL] and ten sham surgery controls) underwent baseline hepatic FAIR ASL with T1 measurement and caval subtraction PCMRI (with two-dimensional infra-/supra-hepatic inferior vena caval studies), induction of inflammation with intravenous lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and repeat liver FAIR ASL with T1 measurement after ~90 minutes. The mean difference between FAIR ASL hepatic perfusion and caval subtraction PCMRI TLBF was \u221251 \u00b1 30 ml/min/100 g (Bland\u2013Altman 95% limits-of-agreement \u00b1258 ml/min/100 g). The FAIR ASL coefficient of variation was smaller than for caval subtraction PCMRI (29.3% vs 50.1%; P =.03). At baseline, FAIR ASL liver perfusion was lower in BDL rats (199 \u00b1 32 ml/min/100 g vs sham 316 \u00b1 24 ml/min/100 g; P =.01) but liver T1 was higher (BDL 1533 \u00b1 50 vs sham 1256 \u00b1 18 ms; P =.0004). Post-LPS FAIR ASL liver perfusion response differences were observed between sham/BDL rats (P =.02), approaching significance in sham (+78 \u00b1 33 ml/min/100 g; P =.06) but not BDL rats (\u221249 \u00b1 40 ml/min/100 g; P =.47). Post-LPS differences in liver tissue T1 were nonsignificant (P =.35). FAIR ASL hepatic perfusion and caval subtraction PCMRI TLBF agreement was modest, with significant baseline FAIR ASL liver perfusion and tissue T1 differences in rodents with advanced cirrhosis compared with controls. Following inflammatory stress, differences in hepatic perfusion response were detected between cirrhotic/control animals, but liver T1 was unaffected. Findings underline the potential of FAIR ASL in the assessment of vasoactive treatments for patients with chronic liver disease and inflammation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["arterial spin labelling", "chronic liver disease", "cirrhosis", "inflammation", "liver perfusion", "liver T1", "phase-contrast MRI", "sepsis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Arterial spin labelling", "Chronic liver disease", "Coefficient of variation", "Flow sensitive alternating inversion recoveries", "Lipopolysaccharides", "Noninvasive measurements", "Phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging", "Phase contrast MRI"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092137225", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"]], "AuthorData": {"12794809100": {"Name": "Chouhan M.D.", "AuthorID": "12794809100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Medical Imaging"}, "55780918900": {"Name": "Ramasawmy R.", "AuthorID": "55780918900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Medical Imaging"}, "8576309800": {"Name": "Bainbridge A.", "AuthorID": "8576309800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Medical Imaging"}, "55070698800": {"Name": "Campbell-Washburn A.", "AuthorID": "55070698800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Medical Imaging"}, "55642708000": {"Name": "Halligan S.", "AuthorID": "55642708000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Medical Imaging"}, "7202610468": {"Name": "Davies N.", "AuthorID": "7202610468", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Medical Imaging"}, "57203674289": {"Name": "Walker-Samuel S.", "AuthorID": "57203674289", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Medical Imaging"}, "7004107686": {"Name": "Lythgoe M.F.", "AuthorID": "7004107686", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Medical Imaging"}, "6603672216": {"Name": "Mookerjee R.P.", "AuthorID": "6603672216", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Medical Imaging"}, "57203543924": {"Name": "Taylor S.A.", "AuthorID": "57203543924", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Medical Imaging"}}}
