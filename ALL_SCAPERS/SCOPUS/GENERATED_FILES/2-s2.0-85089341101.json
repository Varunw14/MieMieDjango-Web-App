Alzheimer's & Dementia: Diagnosis, Assessment & Disease Monitoring published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of the Alzheimer's Association.Introduction: Pyroglutamate-modified amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2pE3) could be a biomarker for A\u03b2 plaque pathology in the brain. An ultra-high-sensitive assay is needed for detecting A\u03b2pE3-40. Methods: Immunomagnetic reduction was used for quantification of A\u03b2pE3-40 in plasma from 46 participants. The concentrations of A\u03b2pE3-40 of these subjects were compared with 18F-florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) images. Results: A\u03b2pE3-40 concentration was 44.1 \u00b1 28.2 fg/mL in PET- (n = 28) and 91.6 \u00b1 54.6 fg/mL in PET+ (n = 18; P <.05). The cutoff value of A\u03b2pE3-40 for discriminating PET- from PET+ was 55.5 fg/mL, resulting in a sensitivity of 83.3%, a specificity of 71.4%. The concentration of A\u03b2pE3-40 showed a moderate correlation (r = 0.437) with PET standardized uptake value ratio. Discussion: We did not enroll pre-clinical AD subject with normal cognition but A\u03b2 PET+. It would be an important issue to explore the feasibility of using A\u03b2pE3-40 for screening pre-clinical subjects. Conclusion: These results reveal the feasibility of detecting A\u03b2 pathology using quantification of a plaque-derived A\u03b2 molecule in plasma.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089341101", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57221869863": {"Name": "Wang P.N.", "AuthorID": "57221869863", "AffiliationID": "60069716", "AffiliationName": "Brain Research Center, National Yang-Ming University"}, "26643558000": {"Name": "Lin K.J.", "AuthorID": "26643558000", "AffiliationID": "60020351", "AffiliationName": "Healthy Aging Research Center and Department of Medical Imaging and Radiological Sciences, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University"}, "57216341123": {"Name": "Liu H.C.", "AuthorID": "57216341123", "AffiliationID": "60095842", "AffiliationName": "MagQu Co., Ltd."}, "25959388900": {"Name": "Yang S.Y.", "AuthorID": "25959388900", "AffiliationID": "123247606", "AffiliationName": "MagQu LLC"}, "6507790467": {"Name": "Andreasson U.", "AuthorID": "6507790467", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL"}}}
