The objective of this study was to examine the structural characteristics of the Movement Disorder Society Non-Motor Rating Scale by factor and cluster analyses. Methods: Data came from the validation study, an international multicenter cross-sectional study of 402 Parkinson's disease patients. Demographic and clinical data, the Movement Disorder Society Non-Motor Rating Scale, and Hoehn and Yahr staging were used. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis and nonhierarchical cluster analysis were performed. Results: The exploratory factor analysis showed that all 13 domains of the Movement Disorder Society Non-Motor Rating Scale, except 1, and the Non-Motor Fluctuations subscale performed as unidimensional (variance explained: 0.36, sleep and wakefulness; \u22120.82, orthostatic hypotension). The confirmatory factor analysis could be carried out in 9 domains and showed that 6 of them and the Non-Motor Fluctuations subscale adjusted to the model satisfactorily according to the root mean square error of approximation. Furthermore, all domains had comparative fit index values >0.95, except depression and pain (both, 0.94) and sleep and wakefulness (0.90). The Non-Motor Fluctuations subscale showed satisfactory root mean square error of approximation (0.07), but a low comparative fit index value (0.91). A 5-cluster solution, correctly classifying 96% of the cases, was found. Conclusions: Overall, most subscales of the Movement Disorder Society Non-Motor Rating Scale are unidimensional, and although each subscale is distinct in terms of content covered, factors and clusters that are of clinical relevance are discernible and contribute to our understanding of possible nonmotor subtypes in Parkinson's disease. \u00a9 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cluster analysis", "factor analysis", "Nonmotor symptoms", "Parkinson's disease", "rating scale"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082426088", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"7005097519": {"Name": "Martinez-Martin P.", "AuthorID": "7005097519", "AffiliationID": "60085102, 60001602", "AffiliationName": "Center for Networked Biomedical Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases (CIBERNED), Carlos III Institute of Health"}, "8218466100": {"Name": "Rojo-Abu\u00edn J.M.", "AuthorID": "8218466100", "AffiliationID": "60006754", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, Center of Human and Social Sciences, Spanish Council for Scientific Research"}, "57203216133": {"Name": "Weintraub D.", "AuthorID": "57203216133", "AffiliationID": "60003711, 60006297, 60023695", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurology, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania; Parkinson's Disease Research, Education and Clinical Center, Philadelphia Department of Veterans Affairs"}, "7102516281": {"Name": "Chaudhuri K.R.", "AuthorID": "7102516281", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60029685", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Department of Neurosciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience and Parkinson's Foundation Centre of Excellence, King's College Hospital"}, "54383938600": {"Name": "Rizos A.", "AuthorID": "54383938600", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60029685", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Department of Neurosciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience and Parkinson's Foundation Centre of Excellence, King's College Hospital"}, "56010307300": {"Name": "Rodriguez-Bl\u00e1zquez C.", "AuthorID": "56010307300", "AffiliationID": "60012588, 60001602, 60085102", "AffiliationName": "National Center of Epidemiology and Center for Networked Biomedical Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases (CIBERNED), Carlos III Institute of Health"}, "55802371059": {"Name": "Schrag A.", "AuthorID": "55802371059", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}}}
