In addition, we investigated the mechanism of antibiotic action of the derivatives to identify their therapeutic target. We discovered compound 2 to be an extremely potent inhibitor of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv growth (MIC: 0.031 mg/L) in vitro, performing better than the currently used first-line antituberculosis drugs such as isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pretomanid in vitro. Furthermore, compound 3 was equipotent to pretomanid against a multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis clinical isolate. The derivatives were selective and bactericidal towards slow-growing mycobacteria. They showed low cytotoxicity towards murine RAW 264.7 and human THP-1 cell lines, with high selectivity indices. Compound 1 effectively eliminated the intracellular mycobacteria in a mycobacteria-infected macrophage model. The derivatives were assessed for their potential to inhibit mycobacterial arylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT) and were identified as good inhibitors of recombinant mycobacterial NAT, a novel target essential for the intracellular survival of M. tuberculosis. This study provided hits for designing new potent and selective antituberculosis leads, having mycobacterial NAT inhibition as their possible endogenous mechanisms of action.", "AuthorKeywords": ["5-nitrofuran", "Antibiotic resistance", "Arylamine N-acetyltransferase", "Tuberculosis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087428413", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)", "PHAR", "3000"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"56672604300": {"Name": "Agre N.", "AuthorID": "56672604300", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, The Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "16551254700": {"Name": "Tawari N.", "AuthorID": "16551254700", "AffiliationID": "60006361", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Technology, Institute of Chemical Technology"}, "57204248455": {"Name": "Degani M.", "AuthorID": "57204248455", "AffiliationID": "60006361", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Technology, Institute of Chemical Technology"}, "55831167600": {"Name": "Maitra A.", "AuthorID": "55831167600", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, The Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "35068102400": {"Name": "Gupta A.", "AuthorID": "35068102400", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}, "6701498589": {"Name": "Bhakta S.", "AuthorID": "6701498589", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, The Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "36818894600": {"Name": "Munshi T.", "AuthorID": "36818894600", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Infection and Immunity, St George\u2019s, University of London"}}}
