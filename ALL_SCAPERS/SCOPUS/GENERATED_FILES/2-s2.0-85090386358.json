Due to the expansion of the Universe, galaxies recede from each other on average. This movement causes the emitted electromagnetic waves to shift from the blue part of the spectrum to the red part, due to the Doppler effect. Redshift is one of the most important observables in Astronomy, allowing the measurement of galaxy distances. Several sources of noise render the estimation process far from trivial, especially in the low signal-to-noise regime of many astrophysical observations. In recent years, new approaches for a reliable and automated estimation methodology have been sought out, in order to minimize our reliance on currently popular techniques that heavily involve human intervention. The fulfilment of this task has evolved into a grave necessity, in conjunction with the insatiable generation of immense amounts of astronomical data. In our work, we introduce a novel approach based on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. The proposed methodology is extensively evaluated on a spectroscopic dataset of full spectral energy galaxy distributions, modelled after the upcoming Euclid satellite galaxy survey. Experimental analysis on observations of idealistic and realistic conditions demonstrate the potent capabilities of the proposed scheme.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Astrophysics", "convolutional neural networks", "cosmology", "deep learning", "euclid", "spectroscopic redshift estimation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Astronomical data", "Automated estimation", "Estimation process", "Expansion of the universe", "Experimental analysis", "Galaxy distribution", "Human intervention", "Realistic conditions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090386358", "SubjectAreas": [["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Information Systems and Management", "DECI", "1802"]], "AuthorData": {"57209600254": {"Name": "Stivaktakis R.", "AuthorID": "57209600254", "AffiliationID": "60001524", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Crete"}, "6701848334": {"Name": "Tsakalides P.", "AuthorID": "6701848334", "AffiliationID": "60001524", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Crete"}, "34870845200": {"Name": "Tsagkatakis G.", "AuthorID": "34870845200", "AffiliationID": "60019181, 60035865", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Computer Science, Foundation for Research and Technology (FORTH)"}, "26537740700": {"Name": "Moraes B.", "AuthorID": "26537740700", "AffiliationID": "60000036", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Fisica, Universidade Federal Do Rio de Janeiro"}, "15841786900": {"Name": "Abdalla F.", "AuthorID": "15841786900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7005106453": {"Name": "Starck J.L.", "AuthorID": "7005106453", "AffiliationID": "60019615", "AffiliationName": "Astrophysics Department, Cea Saclay"}}}
