Published by BMJ.Objectives Children from South Asian ethnic backgrounds are at increased risk of obesity and its associated future health risks; however, evidence is lacking as to whether parental concern about their child's future overweight risk varies by ethnic background. We hypothesised that parents of 5-year-old children from South Asian backgrounds would be more likely to express such concerns. Design Cross-sectional. Setting UK. Participants 15 039 singleton 5-year-old Millennium Cohort Study participants (48.9% girls; 86.7% White). Primary outcome measure Parent-reported concern (some/none) about future overweight risk. Methods We estimated the adjusted ORs (aORs) of some parental concern (ranging from a little to very concerned) by child's ethnic background (reference group: White), adjusted for parent and child weight status, and child sex. Results Parents of girls from Pakistani (aOR 0.4; 95% CI 0.2 to 0.5), Bangladeshi (0.3; 0.2 to 0.5), Black African (0.5; 0.3 to 0.7) and Mixed (0.7; 0.5 to 0.99) ethnic backgrounds and of boys from Pakistani ethnic backgrounds (0.6; 0.4 to 0.9) were less likely to report concern about their child's future overweight risk than parents of White girls and boys, respectively. Overweight (2.5; 2.2 to 2.8) and obesity (6.7; 5.7 to 7.9) in children, and overweight (1.4; 1.2 to 1.5) and obesity (1.9; 1.7 to 2.2) in parents, were associated with increased likelihood of concern. Conclusions Parents of children from South Asian ethnic backgrounds express less concern about their child's future overweight risk. Qualitative studies are needed to understand the concerns of parents from different ethnic backgrounds to inform weight-management interventions in ethnically diverse populations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["concern", "ethnic groups", "overweight", "parents", "Pediatric obesity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Body Mass Index", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Ethnic Groups", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Health Surveys", "Humans", "Male", "Overweight", "Parents", "Prevalence", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071757990", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57196329977": {"Name": "Firman N.", "AuthorID": "57196329977", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57210230069": {"Name": "Dezateux C.", "AuthorID": "57210230069", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
