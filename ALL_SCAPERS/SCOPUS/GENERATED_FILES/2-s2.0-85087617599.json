Biometrical Journal published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.Doug Altman was a visionary leader and one of the most influential medical statisticians of the last 40 years. Based on a presentation in the \u201cInvited session in memory of Doug Altman\u201d at the 40th Annual Conference of the International Society for Clinical Biostatistics (ISCB) in Leuven, Belgium and our long-standing collaborations with Doug, we discuss his contributions to regression modeling, reporting, prognosis research, as well as some more general issues while acknowledging that we cannot cover the whole spectrum of Doug's considerable methodological output. His statement \u201cTo maximize the benefit to society, you need to not just do research but do it well\u201d should be a driver for all researchers.
