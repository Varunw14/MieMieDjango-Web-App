MicroRNA biogenesis involves the enzymatic processing of a primary RNA transcript. The final step is the production of a duplex molecule, often designated as miRNA:miRNA*, that will yield a functional miRNA by separation of the two strands. This miRNA will be incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex, which subsequently will bind to its target mRNA in order to suppress its expression. The analysis of miRNAs is still a developing area for computational biology with many open questions regarding the structure and function of this important class of molecules. Here, we present StarSeeker, a simple tool that outputs the putative miRNA* sequence given the precursor and the mature sequences. Results: We evaluated StarSeeker using a dataset consisting of all plant sequences available in miRBase (6992 precursor sequences and 8496 mature sequences). The program returned a total of 15,468 predicted miRNA* sequences. Of these, 2650 sequences were matched to annotated miRNAs (~ 90% of the miRBase-annotated sequences). The remaining predictions could not be verified, mainly because they do not comply with the rule requiring the two overhanging nucleotides in the duplex molecule. Conclusions: The expression pattern of some miRNAs in plants can be altered under various abiotic stress conditions. Potential miRNA* molecules that do not degrade can thus be detected and also discovered in high-throughput sequencing data, helping us to understand their role in gene regulation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["MiRNA maturation", "Plant transcriptome", "Sequence prediction", "Transcription regulation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081900594", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"57211514674": {"Name": "Natsidis P.", "AuthorID": "57211514674", "AffiliationID": "60012413, 60001524", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, University of Crete, Voutes University Campus"}, "56125535200": {"Name": "Kappas I.", "AuthorID": "56125535200", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Development and Molecular Biology, School of Biology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "6603240651": {"Name": "Karlowski W.M.", "AuthorID": "6603240651", "AffiliationID": "60014168, 60011405", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computational Biology, Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Faculty of Biology, Adam Mickiewicz University"}}}
