An important special case of our setup is the two-way regression model. This is a workhorse technique in the analysis of matched data sets, such as employer\u2013employee or student\u2013teacher panel data. We formalize how the structure of the network affects the accuracy with which the fixed effects can be estimated. This allows us to derive sufficient conditions on the network for consistent estimation and asymptotically valid inference to be possible. Estimation of moments is also considered. We allow for general networks and our setup covers both the dense and the sparse case. We provide numerical results for the estimation of teacher value-added models and regressions with occupational dummies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Connectivity", "fixed effects", "graph", "Laplacian", "limited mobility", "teacher value-added", "two-way regression model"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073215683", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"55227893400": {"Name": "Jochmans K.", "AuthorID": "55227893400", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Economics, University of Cambridge"}, "55241495000": {"Name": "Weidner M.", "AuthorID": "55241495000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University College London"}}}
