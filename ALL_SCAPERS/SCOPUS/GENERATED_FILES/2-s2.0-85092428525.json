As such, evaluating nanoparticle size dispersity is of fundamental importance. Conventional approaches, such as standard deviation, usually require the nanoparticle population to follow a known distribution and are ill-equipped to deal with highly poly- or heterodisperse populations. Herein, we propose the use of information entropy as an alternative and assumption-free method for describing nanoparticle size distributions. This measure works equally well for mono-, poly-, and heterodisperse populations and represents an unbiased route to evaluation and optimization of nanoparticle synthesis. We provide intuitive software tools for analysis and supply guidelines for interpretation with respect to known standards.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Conventional approach", "Dispersity", "Heterodisperse", "Information entropy", "Nanoparticle size distribution", "Nanoparticle sizes", "Nanoparticle synthesis", "Standard deviation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092428525", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57204212322": {"Name": "Mac Fhionnlaoich N.", "AuthorID": "57204212322", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Chemical Engineering"}, "25927105300": {"Name": "Guldin S.", "AuthorID": "25927105300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Chemical Engineering"}}}
