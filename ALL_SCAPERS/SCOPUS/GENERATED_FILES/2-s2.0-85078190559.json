Real-world actors have bounded-rationality, reflected by their limited foresight and heterogeneous expectations, and as past trends influence their investments. Agent-based models are highly suitable modelling frameworks to study such realistic and complex energy transition dynamics. This paper introduces BRAIN-Energy, a novel agent-based model which explicitly allows to explore the impacts of actors' heterogeneous characteristics, and of their interactions, on the transition pathways of the UK, German and Italian electricity sectors. Results show that actors' heterogeneous characteristics pose barriers to effective decarbonisation efforts, affect the speed of the transition, and impact the transition's security of supply and affordability dimensions. Limited foresight and path-dependency lead to investment cycles (both virtuous and vicious). The country comparison highlights how such effects are stronger in markets with more heterogeneous market players.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Agent-based modelling", "Bounded-rationality", "Energy sector", "Heterogeneity of actors", "Investment decisions", "Low-carbon transition"], "IndexKeywords": ["Agent-based modelling", "Bounded rationality", "Energy sector", "Heterogeneity of actors", "Investment decisions", "Low-carbon transitions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078190559", "SubjectAreas": [["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"57214080337": {"Name": "Barazza E.", "AuthorID": "57214080337", "AffiliationID": "60084282", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute, Central House"}, "57204344067": {"Name": "Strachan N.", "AuthorID": "57204344067", "AffiliationID": "60084282", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute, Central House"}}}
