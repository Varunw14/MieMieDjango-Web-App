Biotechnology Journal published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimMultivariate data analysis (MVDA) is a highly valuable and significantly underutilized resource in biomanufacturing. It offers the opportunity to enhance understanding and leverage useful information from complex high-dimensional data sets, recorded throughout all stages of therapeutic drug manufacture. To help standardize the application and promote this resource within the biopharmaceutical industry, this paper outlines a novel MVDA methodology describing the necessary steps for efficient and effective data analysis. The MVDA methodology is followed to solve two case studies: a \u201csmall data\u201d and a \u201cbig data\u201d challenge. In the \u201csmall data\u201d example, a large-scale data set is compared to data from a scale-down model. This methodology enables a new quantitative metric for equivalence to be established by combining a two one-sided test with principal component analysis. In the \u201cbig data\u201d example, this methodology enables accurate predictions of critical missing data essential to a cloning study performed in the ambr15 system. These predictions are generated by exploiting the underlying relationship between the off-line missing values and the on-line measurements through the generation of a partial least squares model. In summary, the proposed MVDA methodology highlights the importance of data pre-processing, restructuring, and visualization during data analytics to solve complex biopharmaceutical challenges.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cell culture", "missing data", "multivariate data analysis", "scale-up/down", "two one-sided test"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biopharmaceutical industry", "High dimensional data", "Large scale data sets", "Missing data", "Multivariate data analysis", "On-line measurement", "Partial least squares models", "Scale-up", "Bioreactors", "Biotechnology", "Data Analysis", "Least-Squares Analysis", "Multivariate Analysis", "Principal Component Analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075448638", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology", "IMMU", "2402"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"]], "AuthorData": {"55489105000": {"Name": "Goldrick S.", "AuthorID": "55489105000", "AffiliationID": "60101501", "AffiliationName": "Cell Sciences, Biopharmaceutical Development, MedImmune"}, "7005343335": {"Name": "Farid S.S.", "AuthorID": "7005343335", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "24605341500": {"Name": "Cheeks M.", "AuthorID": "24605341500", "AffiliationID": "60101501", "AffiliationName": "Cell Sciences, Biopharmaceutical Development, MedImmune"}, "15833710300": {"Name": "Turner R.", "AuthorID": "15833710300", "AffiliationID": "60101501", "AffiliationName": "Cell Sciences, Biopharmaceutical Development, MedImmune"}, "57204813599": {"Name": "Sandner V.", "AuthorID": "57204813599", "AffiliationID": "123497732", "AffiliationName": "FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies, Process Design and Data Science"}, "36573923500": {"Name": "McCreath G.", "AuthorID": "36573923500", "AffiliationID": "123497732", "AffiliationName": "FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies, Process Design and Data Science"}, "6602153642": {"Name": "Glassey J.", "AuthorID": "6602153642", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, Newcastle University"}}}
