Species distribution data are found in a variety of sources, each of which has its own distinct bias toward certain taxa, time periods or places. We present GalliForm, a database that comprises 186687 galliform occurrence records linked to 118907 localities in Europe and Asia. Records were derived from museums, peer-reviewed and grey literature, unpublished field notes, diaries and correspondence, banding records, atlas records and online birding trip reports. We describe data collection processes, georeferencing methods and quality-control procedures. This database has underpinned several peer-reviewed studies, investigating spatial and temporal bias in biodiversity data, species\u2019 geographic range changes and local extirpation patterns. In our rapidly changing world, an understanding of long-term change in species\u2019 distributions is key to predicting future impacts of threatening processes such as land use change, over-exploitation of species and climate change. This database, its historical aspect in particular, provides a valuable source of information for further studies in macroecology and biodiversity conservation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animal Distribution", "Animals", "Asia", "Biodiversity", "Databases, Factual", "Europe", "Galliformes", "Geographic Mapping"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092502753", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"], ["Library and Information Sciences", "SOCI", "3309"]], "AuthorData": {"16021108800": {"Name": "Boakes E.H.", "AuthorID": "16021108800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research, University College London"}, "7006595259": {"Name": "Mace G.M.", "AuthorID": "7006595259", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research, University College London"}, "16401209100": {"Name": "Fuller R.A.", "AuthorID": "16401209100", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, University of Queensland"}, "24464763200": {"Name": "Ding C.", "AuthorID": "24464763200", "AffiliationID": "60006782", "AffiliationName": "College of Biological Sciences and Biotechnology, Beijing Forestry University"}, "57219394160": {"Name": "Ang T.T.", "AuthorID": "57219394160", "AffiliationID": "60009498, 60005453", "AffiliationName": "The Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London, Regents Park"}, "36650477600": {"Name": "Auffret A.G.", "AuthorID": "36650477600", "AffiliationID": "60027152", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ecology, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences"}, "36514467200": {"Name": "Clark N.E.", "AuthorID": "36514467200", "AffiliationID": "60007317", "AffiliationName": "National Environment Research Council, Polaris House, North Star Avenue"}, "57219376707": {"Name": "Gilbert J.", "AuthorID": "57219376707", "AffiliationID": "60009498, 60005453", "AffiliationName": "The Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London, Regents Park"}, "57220301385": {"Name": "Irlich U.", "AuthorID": "57220301385", "AffiliationID": "60010833", "AffiliationName": "Fisheries and Oceans Canada"}, "57219382339": {"Name": "Joachim E.", "AuthorID": "57219382339", "AffiliationID": "60009498, 60005453", "AffiliationName": "The Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London, Regents Park"}, "57219390355": {"Name": "O\u2019 Connor K.", "AuthorID": "57219390355", "AffiliationID": "60009498, 60005453", "AffiliationName": "The Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London, Regents Park"}, "7005088726": {"Name": "Schleicher J.", "AuthorID": "7005088726", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University of Cambridge"}, "57219389406": {"Name": "Stebbing S.", "AuthorID": "57219389406", "AffiliationID": "60009498, 60005453", "AffiliationName": "The Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London, Regents Park"}, "57201981074": {"Name": "Dunn J.", "AuthorID": "57201981074", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "School of Biology, Newcastle University"}, "57211447596": {"Name": "Gupta G.", "AuthorID": "57211447596", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "School of Biology, Newcastle University"}, "7004854418": {"Name": "McGowan P.J.K.", "AuthorID": "7004854418", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "School of Biology, Newcastle University"}, "55344107400": {"Name": "Golovnyuk V.", "AuthorID": "55344107400", "AffiliationID": "120143054", "AffiliationName": "FSBI \u201cTaimyr Reserves\u201d"}, "57219379403": {"Name": "Potapov E.", "AuthorID": "57219379403", "AffiliationID": "111805146", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Bryn Athyn College"}, "8695162900": {"Name": "Potapov R.", "AuthorID": "8695162900", "AffiliationID": "60101968", "AffiliationName": "Zoological Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "50862354000": {"Name": "Townshend T.", "AuthorID": "50862354000", "AffiliationID": "125208211", "AffiliationName": "Birding Beijing, Great Walsingham"}}}
