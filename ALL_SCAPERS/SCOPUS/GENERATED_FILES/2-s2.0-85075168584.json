For Esposito, to reduce community to a property whose possession distinguishes members from non-members undermines the commonality the term implies. The common opposes what is proper or one\u2019s own; it belongs to everyone and anyone. Rather than securing identity and belonging, community, defined by its impropriety, disrupts them so that we are in common. While his work successfully illustrates the incompatibility of the common and the proper, it leaves unanswered the question of how communities come to experience their impropriety. Through a comparison with Ranci\u00e8re\u2019s improper community, we can identify and gesture beyond this limit. Its members intervene in proper communities by exercising the right to decide on common matters despite officially having no right to do so. Their actions, by demonstrating the openness of the common to anyone and everyone, turn its privatisation into a shared wrong that connects community with non-community. By supplementing Esposito\u2019s work with Ranci\u00e8re\u2019s, we see how communities relate to what they have deemed improper in a way that both challenges and revitalises their sense of commonality.", "AuthorKeywords": ["community", "Esposito", "immunity", "impropriety", "Ranci\u00e8re", "the proper"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075168584", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"26034053200": {"Name": "Inston K.", "AuthorID": "26034053200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of European Languages, Culture and Society, University College London"}}}
