Much of this is aimed at enabling secure prediction from highly-accurate Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, as DNNs are trained on data, a key question is how such models can be also trained securely. The few prior works on secure DNN training have focused either on designing custom protocols for existing training algorithms, or on developing tailored training algorithms and then applying generic secure protocols. In this work, we investigate the advantages of designing training algorithms alongside a novel secure protocol, incorporating optimizations on both fronts. We present QUOTIENT, a new method for discretized training of DNNs, along with a customized secure two-party protocol for it. QUOTIENT incorporates key components of state-of-the-art DNN training such as layer normalization and adaptive gradient methods, and improves upon the state-of-the-art in DNN training in two-party computation. Compared to prior work, we obtain an improvement of 50X in WAN time and 6% in absolute accuracy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Privacy-preserving deep learning", "Quantized deep neural networks", "Secure multi-party computation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Absolute accuracy", "Adaptive gradient methods", "Neural network training", "Privacy preserving", "Secure multi-party computation", "Secure two-party protocols", "Training algorithms", "Two-party computation"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075923565", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"57212107583": {"Name": "Agrawal N.", "AuthorID": "57212107583", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford"}, "56097654500": {"Name": "Kusner M.J.", "AuthorID": "56097654500", "AffiliationID": "60111768", "AffiliationName": "Alan Turing Institute"}, "24779217000": {"Name": "Gasc\u00f3n A.", "AuthorID": "24779217000", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "University of Warwick"}, "57200519640": {"Name": "Shamsabadi A.S.", "AuthorID": "57200519640", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University of London"}}}
