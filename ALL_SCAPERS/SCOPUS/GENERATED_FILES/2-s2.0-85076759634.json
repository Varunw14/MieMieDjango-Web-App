Paediatric and adult practice varies around the world depending on geography, transplant allocation schemes and different emphases on living (versus deceased) donor renal transplantation. Internationally, paediatric patients often have priority in allocation schemes and younger donors are preferentially allocated to paediatric recipients. HLA matching can be difficult and may result in longer waiting times. Additionally, with improved surgical techniques and modern immunosuppressive regimens, how important is the contribution of HLA matching to graft longevity? In this review, we discuss the relative importance of HLA matching compared with donor quality; and long-term patient outcomes including re-transplantation rates. We share empirical evidence that will be useful for clinicians and families to make decisions about best donor options. We discuss why living donation still provides the best allograft survival outcomes and what to do in the scenario of a highly mismatched living donor.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deceased donors", "Human leukocyte antigens", "Kidney transplantation", "Living donors", "Matching", "Mismatching"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076759634", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"37665411800": {"Name": "Kim J.J.", "AuthorID": "37665411800", "AffiliationID": "60020661, 60007820", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Liverpool"}, "7006470337": {"Name": "Fuggle S.V.", "AuthorID": "7006470337", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Transplant Centre, Nuffield Department of Surgical Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "8889557300": {"Name": "Marks S.D.", "AuthorID": "8889557300", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre, University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}}}
