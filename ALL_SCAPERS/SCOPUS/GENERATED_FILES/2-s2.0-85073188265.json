Non-orthogonal spectrally efficient frequency division multiplexing (SEFDM) waveform brings bandwidth saving advantages but at the cost of complex signal processing in IoT devices. Power efficiency is the main concern in IoT applications since IoT devices have limited battery life and cannot easily recharge after deployment. Therefore, signal processing in each IoT device should be as simple as possible. Precoding is applied as the strategy at transmitters to pre-cancel the self-created inter carrier interference (ICI) caused by the non-orthogonal sub-carrier packing, and to facilitate low-complexity IoT receivers. However, the typical zero forcing (ZF) precoding results in performance degradation due to the ill-conditioned precoding matrix. To achieve reliable communications using SEFDM signals, a robust constructive interference (CI) precoding method is employed, which constructively converts interference power to useful signal power. Thus, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is effectively improved leading to better performance than ZF precoding. This work initially studies the performance of precoding methods in simulation. Furthermore, the CI precoding is practically tested over-the-air on a multi-user multiple input multiple output (MIMO)-SEFDM software defined radio NG-IoT platform.", "AuthorKeywords": ["constructive interference", "IoT", "MIMO", "non-orthogonal", "Precoding", "prototyping", "SEFDM", "software defined radio", "spectral efficiency", "USRP"], "IndexKeywords": ["Constructive interference", "Non-orthogonal", "Precoding", "SEFDM", "Software-defined radios", "Spectral efficiencies", "USRP"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073188265", "SubjectAreas": [["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Information Systems and Management", "DECI", "1802"], ["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"55846144300": {"Name": "Xu T.", "AuthorID": "55846144300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57211818673": {"Name": "Liu F.", "AuthorID": "57211818673", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "23009493900": {"Name": "Masouros C.", "AuthorID": "23009493900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7003497031": {"Name": "Darwazeh I.", "AuthorID": "7003497031", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56453725100": {"Name": "Li A.", "AuthorID": "56453725100", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Sydney"}}}
