Specifically, if it is assumed that they are formed through gas-grain interactions, then it is necessary to identify a mechanism that is both efficient at forming the molecules and return them to the gas phase in quiescent clouds. In this paper, we review the recent models that are based on the catastrophic recombination of radicals, stored in ice, that leads to an explosion of the ice mantles and a vigorous high density radical-radical association chemistry. We identify the strengths and weaknesses of the models in recent applications. Finally, we address the often overlooked issue of complex organic molecule (COM) destruction channels and argue that our poor knowledge of the chemical destruction mechanisms is undermining the diagnostic power of COM studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Astrochemistry", "Chemical explosions", "Interstellar clouds", "Interstellar dust", "Interstellar medium: molecules"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072601727", "SubjectAreas": [["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"], ["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57213738246": {"Name": "Rawlings J.M.C.", "AuthorID": "57213738246", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7003564783": {"Name": "Viti S.", "AuthorID": "7003564783", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57140841200": {"Name": "Holdship J.R.", "AuthorID": "57140841200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
