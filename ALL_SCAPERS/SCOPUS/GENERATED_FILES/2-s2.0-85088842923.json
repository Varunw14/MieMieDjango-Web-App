In this new version, we have reflected changes in the way sexual health services are now provided by assuming an integrated Sexual Health/Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare service. There are new recommendations for online testing, female genital mutilation (FGM), chemsex and considerations for transgender (and non-binary) individuals. Previous versions rather assumed a cis-gender clientele and so we have taken a more mechanistic approach to sex and risk without assuming gender identification. We have updated our gender terminology in line with the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV \u2018sexual health standards for trans, including non-binary, people\u2019 although have retained the terminology of \u2018men\u2019 and \u2018women\u2019 in a few cases where it related to other guidelines, e.g. human papillomavirus vaccination and FGM.", "AuthorKeywords": ["environment", "men", "sex workers", "sexual behaviour", "Women"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088842923", "SubjectAreas": [["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"7006616511": {"Name": "Brook G.", "AuthorID": "7006616511", "AffiliationID": "60189083", "AffiliationName": "GUM/HIV, Central Middlesex Hospital"}, "57197542684": {"Name": "Church H.", "AuthorID": "57197542684", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "GUM, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7403478990": {"Name": "Evans C.", "AuthorID": "7403478990", "AffiliationID": "121232720", "AffiliationName": "Hammersmith Broadway Sexual Health Clinic"}, "57218327795": {"Name": "Jenkinson N.", "AuthorID": "57218327795", "AffiliationID": "100985136", "AffiliationName": "Lay Member"}, "18133871100": {"Name": "McClean H.", "AuthorID": "18133871100", "AffiliationID": "121193874", "AffiliationName": "GUM/HIV, Wilberforce Health Centre, City Health Care Partnership CIC"}, "57197789900": {"Name": "Mohammed H.", "AuthorID": "57197789900", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "HIV and STI Department, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "57220533118": {"Name": "Munro H.", "AuthorID": "57220533118", "AffiliationID": "60138359", "AffiliationName": "CSRH Hywel Dda HB"}, "57218328380": {"Name": "Nambia K.", "AuthorID": "57218328380", "AffiliationID": "60003456", "AffiliationName": "Sexual Health HIV Medicine, Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "25959731200": {"Name": "Saunders J.", "AuthorID": "25959731200", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "National Chlamydia Screening Programme, Public Health England"}, "57218327446": {"Name": "Walton L.", "AuthorID": "57218327446", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "The Jefferiss Wing Centre for Sexual Health and HIV, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "7202865115": {"Name": "Sullivan A.", "AuthorID": "7202865115", "AffiliationID": "60032993", "AffiliationName": "Chelsea and Westminster NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
