We undertook an extensive, mixed-methods analysis of how a contemporary multidisciplinary dementia pathway in the UK was experienced and negotiated by service providers. Our pragmatic mixed methods design incorporated three types of research interaction with practitioners: (a) Semi-structured interviews (n = 31) and focus group discussions (n = 4), (b) Practitioner \u2018shadowing\u2019 observations (n = 19), and (c) Service attendance and performance metrics reviews (n = 8). Through an abductive analysis of practitioner narratives and practice observations, we evidenced how inter-practitioner prejudices, restrictive and competitive commissioning frameworks, barriers to effective data sharing and other resource constraints, all challenged integrative dementia care and led to unintended consequences such as practice overlap and failure to identify and respond to people's needs. In order to more successfully realise integrated dementia pathways, we propose innovative commissioning frameworks which purposefully seek to diffuse power imbalances, encourage inter-provider respect and understanding, and determine clear lines of responsibility.", "AuthorKeywords": ["commissioning", "Dementia", "integrated care", "mixed methods", "practitioner perspectives", "pragmatism", "third sector"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089530215", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57218547430": {"Name": "Chase M.", "AuthorID": "57218547430", "AffiliationID": "60019611", "AffiliationName": "Psychology, Department of Health and Social Sciences, University of the West of England"}, "57193954291": {"Name": "Lloyd C.E.M.", "AuthorID": "57193954291", "AffiliationID": "60002826", "AffiliationName": "School of Social Sciences, London Metropolitan University"}, "57218550155": {"Name": "Peters B.J.", "AuthorID": "57218550155", "AffiliationID": "60026116", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of East London"}, "35827536400": {"Name": "Chase E.", "AuthorID": "35827536400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, Practice & Society, University College London"}, "57209297519": {"Name": "Lee K.", "AuthorID": "57209297519", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Ageing & Dementia, School of Health Sciences, University of Southampton"}}}
