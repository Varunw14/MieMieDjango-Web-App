Prenatal Diagnosis published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Background: Consent rates for postmortem (PM) examination in the perinatal and paediatric setting have dropped significantly in the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Western Europe. We explored the factors that act as facilitators or barriers to consent and identified processes and practices that support parental decision-making. Methods: A qualitative study conducted with bereaved parents, parent advocates, and health care professionals in the United Kingdom. Analysis was conducted on 439 free-tect comments within a cross-sectional survey, interviews with a subset of 20 survey respondents and 25 health professionals, and a focus group with five parent advocates. Results: Three broad parental decision-making groups were identified: 1, \u201cNot open to postmortem examination\u201d; 2, \u201cConsent regardless of concerns\u201d; and 3, \u201cInitially undecided.\u201d Decisional drivers that were particularly important for this \u201cundecided\u201d group were \u201cthe initial approach,\u201d \u201cadjustment and deliberation,\u201d \u201cdetailed discussion about the procedure,\u201d and \u201cformal consent.\u201d The way in which these were managed by health care staff significantly impacted whether those parents' consented to PM, particularly for those who are ambivalent about the procedure. Conclusions: We propose a set of recommendations to improve the way PM counselling and consent is managed. Adopting such measures is likely to lead to improved family experience and more consistent and high-quality discussion regarding PM.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Autopsy", "Decision Making", "Female", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Parents", "Perinatal Death", "Qualitative Research", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074769617", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"22135567300": {"Name": "Lewis C.", "AuthorID": "22135567300", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, The UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7404448261": {"Name": "Hill M.", "AuthorID": "7404448261", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, The UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7006741537": {"Name": "Chitty L.S.", "AuthorID": "7006741537", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, The UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57203574824": {"Name": "Riddington M.", "AuthorID": "57203574824", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Services, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56808974400": {"Name": "Bevan C.", "AuthorID": "56808974400", "AffiliationID": "110177802", "AffiliationName": "Stillbirth and neonatal death charity (Sands)"}, "57213440583": {"Name": "Fisher J.", "AuthorID": "57213440583", "AffiliationID": "112767959", "AffiliationName": "Antenatal Results and Choices (ARC)"}, "57211662824": {"Name": "Lyas L.", "AuthorID": "57211662824", "AffiliationID": "116601135", "AffiliationName": "The Lullaby Trust"}, "15051669300": {"Name": "Chalmers A.", "AuthorID": "15051669300", "AffiliationID": "60117110", "AffiliationName": "Child Bereavement UK"}, "6507902996": {"Name": "Arthurs O.J.", "AuthorID": "6507902996", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57006097800": {"Name": "Hutchinson J.C.", "AuthorID": "57006097800", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57049165000": {"Name": "Sebire N.", "AuthorID": "57049165000", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Development Biology and Cancer Programme, The UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}}}
