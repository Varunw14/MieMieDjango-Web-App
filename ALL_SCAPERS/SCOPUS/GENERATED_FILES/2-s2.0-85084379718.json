P-Aminophenol glucuronide and 3-methoxyacetaminophen were monitored and semi-quantified using external standards. The assay takes 7.5 min/sample, requires only 5 \u03bcl of plasma and involves minimal sample preparation. The method was validated for rat plasma and cross validated for human and pig plasma and mouse serum. LOQ in plasma for these analytes were 0.44 \u03bcg/ml (APAP-C), 0.58 \u03bcg/ml (APAP-SG), 0.84 \u03bcg/ml (APAP-NAC), 2.75 \u03bcg/ml (APAP-S), 3.00 \u03bcg/ml (APAP-G) and 16 \u03bcg/ml (APAP). Application of the method is illustrated by the analysis of plasma following oral administration of APAP to male Han Wistar rats.", "AuthorKeywords": ["acetaminophen", "APAP", "DILI", "glutathione", "metabolites", "plasma analysis", "UHPLC-MS"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acetaminophen", "Animals", "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid", "Humans", "Plasma", "Rats", "Rats, Wistar", "Swine", "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084379718", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)", "PHAR", "3000"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Medical Laboratory Technology", "HEAL", "3607"]], "AuthorData": {"57201069263": {"Name": "Dargue R.", "AuthorID": "57201069263", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Systems Medicine, Department of Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction, Imperial College London"}, "57202018670": {"Name": "Grant I.", "AuthorID": "57202018670", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Systems Medicine, Department of Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction, Imperial College London"}, "35074661100": {"Name": "Nye L.C.", "AuthorID": "35074661100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Systems Medicine, Department of Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction, Imperial College London"}, "57197374694": {"Name": "Wilson I.D.", "AuthorID": "57197374694", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Systems Medicine, Department of Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction, Imperial College London"}, "7103021970": {"Name": "Nicholls A.", "AuthorID": "7103021970", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline RandD"}, "21740639500": {"Name": "Dare T.", "AuthorID": "21740639500", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline RandD"}, "54793606600": {"Name": "Stahl S.H.", "AuthorID": "54793606600", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "ADME Sciences, Clinical Pharmacology and Safety Sciences RandD, AstraZeneca, Unit 310 Cambridge Science Park"}, "7102157681": {"Name": "Plumb R.S.", "AuthorID": "7102157681", "AffiliationID": "112602069", "AffiliationName": "WatersCorporation"}, "55949753800": {"Name": "Lee K.", "AuthorID": "55949753800", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Science and Services, Royal Veterinary College, University of London"}, "57211739627": {"Name": "Jalan R.", "AuthorID": "57211739627", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7003439361": {"Name": "Coen M.", "AuthorID": "7003439361", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "Oncology Safety, Clinical Pharmacology and Quantitative Pharmacology, Clinical Pharmacology and Safety Sciences, RandD, AstraZeneca"}}}
