It is not known whether the use of such prosthesis designs may predispose to reduced function owing to its constraining design. The components are usually implanted with diaphyseal stem extensions to dissipate the increased forces. The totally stabilized (TS) implant is a contemporary VVC design with metaphyseal fixation only. It has a conforming articulation with increased rotational freedom compared with conventional VVC designs. The aim of this study was to assess whether the use of the contemporary TS implant with its metaphyseally fixed components would be associated with inferior outcomes compared with conventional standard primary posterior stabilized (PS) implants. We reviewed 38 consecutive complex primary TKAs performed using the metaphyseally fixed TS implant and 76 matched patients receiving primary PS TKA, at a minimum follow-up of 24 months. The mean follow-up was 61.1 months (24-102). Only patients with osteoarthritis were included. Clinical outcome was assessed using range of motion (ROM) and Oxford knee score (OKS). Radiographic assessment was performed using the femorotibial angle (FTA) at 6 weeks followed by assessment of bone-implant interface lucencies at final follow-up. There were no major early postoperative complications. The mean postoperative ROM in the TS and PS groups were 114.1 and 112.0, respectively. There was no difference in the mean ROM and OKS between the two groups. The mean FTA for patients in both groups was within 3\u00b0 of the expected. There was no evidence of progressive lucencies or implant migration at final follow-up. The metaphyseally fixed TS knee design achieves comparable short-term functional outcomes when compared with conventional PS designs in primary knee arthroplasty. Long-term follow-up studies are required to assess survivorship.", "AuthorKeywords": ["complex primary TKA", "functional outcomes", "totally stabilized knee", "valgus-varus constrained knee"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Knee Joint", "Knee Prosthesis", "Male", "Prosthesis Design", "Radiography", "Range of Motion, Articular", "Retrospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074435473", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"23050753400": {"Name": "Hossain F.", "AuthorID": "23050753400", "AffiliationID": "60018951", "AffiliationName": "Walsall Healthcare Nhs Trust"}, "24466324900": {"Name": "Konan S.", "AuthorID": "24466324900", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals Nhs Foundation Trust"}, "53979939900": {"Name": "Kayani B.", "AuthorID": "53979939900", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals Nhs Foundation Trust"}, "55534144100": {"Name": "Kontoghiorghe C.", "AuthorID": "55534144100", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals Nhs Foundation Trust"}, "55340753500": {"Name": "Barrack T.", "AuthorID": "55340753500", "AffiliationID": "60016667, 60022756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine, Barnes-Jewish Hospital"}, "57217351072": {"Name": "Sami Haddad F.", "AuthorID": "57217351072", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals Nhs Foundation Trust"}}}
