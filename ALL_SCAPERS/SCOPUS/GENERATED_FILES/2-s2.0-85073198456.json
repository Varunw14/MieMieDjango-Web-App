Growing evidence supports BBB dysfunction in a range of acute and chronic brain diseases, justifying the need for novel research and clinical tools that can non-invasively detect, characterize, and quantify BBB dysfunction in-vivo. Many approaches already exist for measuring BBB dysfunction in man using positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (e.g. dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI measurements of gadolinium leakage). This review paper focusses on MRI measurements of water exchange across the BBB, which occurs through a wide range of pathways, and is likely to be a highly sensitive marker of BBB dysfunction. Key mathematical models and acquisition methods are discussed for the two main approaches: those that utilize contrast agents to enhance relaxation rate differences between the intravascular and extravascular compartments and so enhance the sensitivity of MRI signals to BBB water exchange, and those that utilize the dynamic properties of arterial spin labelling to first isolate signal from intravascular spins and then estimate the impact of water exchange on the evolving signal. Data from studies in healthy and pathological brain tissue are discussed, in addition to validation studies in rodents.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aquaporin", "Blood-brain barrier dysfunction", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Water exchange", "Water permeability"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aquaporins", "Arterial spin labelling", "Blood-brain barrier", "Dynamic contrast enhanced MRI", "Dynamic property", "Essential nutrients", "Water exchange", "Water permeability", "Animals", "Blood-Brain Barrier", "Diffusion", "Humans", "Kinetics", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Models, Biological", "Water"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073198456", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"]], "AuthorData": {"57006507500": {"Name": "Dickie B.R.", "AuthorID": "57006507500", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neuroscience and Experimental Psychology, University of Manchester"}, "6603675937": {"Name": "Parkes L.M.", "AuthorID": "6603675937", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neuroscience and Experimental Psychology, University of Manchester"}, "24766914700": {"Name": "Parker G.J.M.", "AuthorID": "24766914700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, Department of Computer Science and Department of Neuroinflammation, University College London"}}}
