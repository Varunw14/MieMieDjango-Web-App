Published by the American Astronomical Society.Over a four hour period between 2014 June 12-13 a series of three flares were observed within AR 12087. This sequence of flares started with a non-eruptive M-class flare, followed by a non-eruptive C-class flare, and finally ended with a second C-class flare that had an associated filament eruption. In this paper we combine spectroscopic analysis of Interface Region Imaging Spectrometer observations of the Si iv line during the three flares along with a series of nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolations in order to investigate the conditions that lead the final flare to be eruptive. From this analysis it is found to be unlikely that the eruption was triggered by either kink instability or by tether-cutting reconnection, allowing the flux rope to rise into a region where it would be susceptible to the torus instability. The NLFFF modeling does, however, suggest that the overlying magnetic field has a fan-spine topology, raising the possibility that breakout reconnection occurring during the first two flares weakened the overlying field, allowing the flux rope to erupt in the subsequent third flare.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082880242", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57189994055": {"Name": "Woods M.M.", "AuthorID": "57189994055", "AffiliationID": "60002959", "AffiliationName": "Lockheed Martin Solar and Astrophysics Lab"}, "7004033067": {"Name": "Harra L.K.", "AuthorID": "7004033067", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "7201477393": {"Name": "Matthews S.A.", "AuthorID": "7201477393", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "57200712528": {"Name": "Inoue S.", "AuthorID": "57200712528", "AffiliationID": "60000264", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research (ISEE)/Nagoya University Furo-cho"}, "55441321700": {"Name": "Kusano K.", "AuthorID": "55441321700", "AffiliationID": "60000264", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research (ISEE)/Nagoya University Furo-cho"}}}
