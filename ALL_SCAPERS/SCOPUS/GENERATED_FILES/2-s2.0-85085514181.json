The objective of this study was to characterize eating behaviors during the first 10 years of life and evaluate associations with BMI at age 11 years. Method: Data were parental reports of eating behaviors from 15 months to age 10 years (n = 12,048) and standardized body mass index (zBMI) at age 11 years (n = 4884) from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Latent class growth analysis was used to derive latent classes of over-, under-, and fussy-eating. Linear regression models for zBMI at 11 years on each set of classes were fitted to assess associations with eating behavior trajectories. Results: We identified four classes of overeating; \u201clow stable\u201d (70%), \u201clow transient\u201d (15%), \u201clate increasing\u201d (11%), and \u201cearly increasing\u201d (6%). The \u201cearly increasing\u201d class was associated with higher zBMI (boys: \u03b2 = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.65, 1.02; girls: \u03b2 = 1.1; 0.92, 1.28) compared with \u201clow stable.\u201d Six classes were found for undereating; \u201clow stable\u201d (25%), \u201clow transient\u201d (37%), \u201clow decreasing\u201d (21%), \u201chigh transient\u201d (11%), \u201chigh decreasing\u201d (4%), and \u201chigh stable\u201d (2%). The latter was associated with lower zBMI (boys: \u03b2 = \u22120.79; \u22121.15, \u22120.42; girls: \u03b2 = \u22120.76; \u22121.06, \u22120.45). Six classes were found for fussy eating; \u201clow stable\u201d (23%), \u201clow transient\u201d (15%), \u201clow increasing\u201d (28%), \u201chigh decreasing\u201d (14%), \u201clow increasing\u201d (13%), and \u201chigh stable\u201d (8%). The \u201chigh stable\u201d class was associated with lower zBMI (boys: \u03b2 = \u22120.49; \u22120.68\u20130.30; girls: \u03b2 = \u22120.35; \u22120.52, \u22120.18). Conclusions: Early increasing overeating during childhood is associated with higher zBMI at age 11. High persistent levels of undereating and fussy eating are associated with lower zBMI. Longitudinal trajectories of eating behaviors may help identify children potentially at risk of adverse weight outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085514181", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"57190166382": {"Name": "Herle M.", "AuthorID": "57190166382", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics & Health Informatics, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience at King\u2019s College London"}, "57195213771": {"Name": "Stavola B.D.", "AuthorID": "57195213771", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "16031429800": {"Name": "Micali N.", "AuthorID": "16031429800", "AffiliationID": "60009963", "AffiliationName": "Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Division, Department of Child and Adolescent Health, Geneva University Hospital"}, "57195958726": {"Name": "H\u00fcbel C.", "AuthorID": "57195958726", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet"}, "56827294000": {"Name": "Bulik C.M.", "AuthorID": "56827294000", "AffiliationID": "60025111", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nutrition, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}, "57196707133": {"Name": "Ferreira D.L.S.", "AuthorID": "57196707133", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "57070097300": {"Name": "Abdulkadir M.", "AuthorID": "57070097300", "AffiliationID": "60004718, 60026405", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva"}, "23096758000": {"Name": "Yilmaz Z.", "AuthorID": "23096758000", "AffiliationID": "60025111", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}, "57216775598": {"Name": "Loos R.J.F.", "AuthorID": "57216775598", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Icahn Mount Sinai School of Medicine"}, "57204100230": {"Name": "Bryant-Waugh R.", "AuthorID": "57204100230", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "Maudsley Centre for Child and Adolescent Eating Disorders, Michael Rutter Centre for Children and Young People, Maudsley Hospital"}}}
