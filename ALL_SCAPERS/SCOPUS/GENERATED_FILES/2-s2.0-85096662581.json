Two recent phylogenetic studies attempted to do so but several of their conclusions are different from each other. Here we reconstruct the phylogeny of the Sino-Tibetan language family, using Bayesian computational methods applied to a larger and linguistically more diverse sample. Our results confirm previous work in finding that the ancestral Sino-Tibetans first split into Sinitic and Tibeto-Burman clades, and support the existence of key internal relationships. But we find that the initial divergence of this group occurred earlier than previously suggested, at approximately 8000 years before the present, coinciding with the onset of millet-based agriculture and significant environmental changes in the Yellow River region. Our findings illustrate that key aspects of phylogenetic history can be replicated in this complex language family, and calls for a more nuanced understanding of the first Sino-Tibetan speakers in relation to the \u201cearly farming dispersal\u201d theory of language evolution.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096662581", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57220048588": {"Name": "Zhang H.", "AuthorID": "57220048588", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University College London"}, "7005945282": {"Name": "Mace R.", "AuthorID": "7005945282", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University College London"}, "35237036200": {"Name": "Ji T.", "AuthorID": "35237036200", "AffiliationID": "60019499, 60029608", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Animal Ecology and Conservation Biology, Centre for Computational and Evolutionary Biology, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "35291123400": {"Name": "Pagel M.", "AuthorID": "35291123400", "AffiliationID": "60030961", "AffiliationName": "Santa Fe Institute"}}}
