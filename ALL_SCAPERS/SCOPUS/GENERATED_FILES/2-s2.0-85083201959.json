All rights reserved.It has been over 150 years since the term \u201ccollagen\u201d was first adopted in the English language. This ropelike structure that yields gelatin upon boiling made its early appearance in evolution in primitive animals such as jellyfish, coral, and sea anemones. Today, the collagen family of proteins has grown to 28 different types and is used as a versatile biomaterial for delivery of drugs as well as for cosmetic purposes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bone pathology", "Collagen assembly", "Fibrillar collagen", "Fibrillogenesis", "Transcription regulation", "Type I collagen"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083201959", "SubjectAreas": [["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"7004519069": {"Name": "Bou-Gharios G.", "AuthorID": "7004519069", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ageing and Chronic Disease, University of Liverpool"}, "57203195982": {"Name": "Abraham D.", "AuthorID": "57203195982", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases, University College London"}, "7102600337": {"Name": "de Crombrugghe B.", "AuthorID": "7102600337", "AffiliationID": "60015023", "AffiliationName": "The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center"}}}
