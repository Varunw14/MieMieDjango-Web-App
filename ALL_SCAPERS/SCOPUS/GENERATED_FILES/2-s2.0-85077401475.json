PMP22 duplication/deletion was previously excluded in demyelinating cases. We reviewed the genetic and clinical data upon completion of the diagnostic process.ResultsAfter targeted NGS sequencing, a definite molecular diagnosis, defined as a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant, was reached in 30% of cases (n = 67). The diagnostic rate was similar in London (32%) and Iowa (29%). Variants of unknown significance were found in an additional 33% of cases. Mutations in GJB1, MFN2, and MPZ accounted for 39% of cases that received genetic confirmation, while the remainder of positive cases had mutations in diverse genes, including SH3TC2, GDAP1, IGHMBP2, LRSAM1, FDG4, and GARS, and another 12 less common genes. Copy number changes in PMP22, MPZ, MFN2, SH3TC2, and FDG4 were also accurately detected. A definite genetic diagnosis was more likely in cases with an early onset, a positive family history of neuropathy or consanguinity, and a demyelinating neuropathy.ConclusionsNGS panels are effective tools in the diagnosis of CMT, leading to genetic confirmation in one-Third of cases negative for PMP22 duplication/deletion, thus highlighting how rarer and previously undiagnosed subtypes represent a relevant part of the genetic landscape of CMT.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age of Onset", "Aged", "Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease", "Cohort Studies", "Consanguinity", "Demyelinating Diseases", "Family", "Female", "Gene Dosage", "Gene Duplication", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Prospective Studies", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077401475", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57185293700": {"Name": "Cortese A.", "AuthorID": "57185293700", "AffiliationID": "60009788", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine"}, "8248290200": {"Name": "Polke J.M.", "AuthorID": "8248290200", "AffiliationID": "120876243", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases"}, "57184044500": {"Name": "Poh R.", "AuthorID": "57184044500", "AffiliationID": "120876243", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases"}, "56593282600": {"Name": "Skorupinska M.", "AuthorID": "56593282600", "AffiliationID": "120876243", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases"}, "57218107544": {"Name": "Rossor A.M.", "AuthorID": "57218107544", "AffiliationID": "120876243", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases"}, "22951097700": {"Name": "Laura M.", "AuthorID": "22951097700", "AffiliationID": "120876243", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases"}, "56730877900": {"Name": "Tomaselli P.J.", "AuthorID": "56730877900", "AffiliationID": "120876243", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases"}, "7003363686": {"Name": "Houlden H.", "AuthorID": "7003363686", "AffiliationID": "120876243", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases"}, "57203175311": {"Name": "Reilly M.M.", "AuthorID": "57203175311", "AffiliationID": "120876243", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases"}, "57212800474": {"Name": "Wilcox J.E.", "AuthorID": "57212800474", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain and Behavioral Sciences, University of Pavia"}, "7005664390": {"Name": "Shy M.E.", "AuthorID": "7005664390", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain and Behavioral Sciences, University of Pavia"}}}
