Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the cerebellum can be used to enhance learning. In this study, we investigated the effects of cerebellar intermittent theta burst stimulation (c-iTBS), a high-frequency rTMS protocol, on visuo-motor learning in a sample of hemiparetic patients due to recent stroke in the territory of the contralateral middle cerebral artery. Eight stroke patients were enrolled for the purposes of the study in the chronic stage of recovery (i.e., at least 6 months after stroke). In two sessions, Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with real or sham c-iTBS applied over the cerebellar hemisphere ipsilateral to the affected body side. c-iTBS was applied immediately before the learning phase of a visuo-motor adaptation task. Real, but not sham, c-iTBS improved visuo-motor learning as revealed by an increased performance in of the learning phase of the visuo-moto adaptation task. Moreover, we also found that real but not sham c-iTBS induced a sustained improvement in the re-adaptation of the recently learned skill (i.e., when patients were re-tested after 30 min). Taken together, these data point to c-iTBS as a potential novel strategy to promote motor learning in patients with stroke.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cerebellum", "Motor learning", "Stroke", "TBS", "TMS/EEG"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085508801", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"26533986400": {"Name": "Bonn\u00ec S.", "AuthorID": "26533986400", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "Non Invasive Brain Stimulation Unit/Department of Behavioral and Clinical Neurology, Santa Lucia Foundation IRCCS"}, "36461399500": {"Name": "Motta C.", "AuthorID": "36461399500", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "Non Invasive Brain Stimulation Unit/Department of Behavioral and Clinical Neurology, Santa Lucia Foundation IRCCS"}, "6504027566": {"Name": "Pellicciari M.C.", "AuthorID": "6504027566", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "Non Invasive Brain Stimulation Unit/Department of Behavioral and Clinical Neurology, Santa Lucia Foundation IRCCS"}, "55613454600": {"Name": "Casula E.P.", "AuthorID": "55613454600", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "Non Invasive Brain Stimulation Unit/Department of Behavioral and Clinical Neurology, Santa Lucia Foundation IRCCS"}, "57142540200": {"Name": "Cinnera A.M.", "AuthorID": "57142540200", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "Non Invasive Brain Stimulation Unit/Department of Behavioral and Clinical Neurology, Santa Lucia Foundation IRCCS"}, "57194787766": {"Name": "Maiella M.", "AuthorID": "57194787766", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "Non Invasive Brain Stimulation Unit/Department of Behavioral and Clinical Neurology, Santa Lucia Foundation IRCCS"}, "55751811700": {"Name": "Picazio S.", "AuthorID": "55751811700", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "Non Invasive Brain Stimulation Unit/Department of Behavioral and Clinical Neurology, Santa Lucia Foundation IRCCS"}, "55582169600": {"Name": "Tramontano M.", "AuthorID": "55582169600", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "Non Invasive Brain Stimulation Unit/Department of Behavioral and Clinical Neurology, Santa Lucia Foundation IRCCS"}, "36866518200": {"Name": "Koch G.", "AuthorID": "36866518200", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Neuropsychophysiology Lab, IRCCS Fondazione S.
