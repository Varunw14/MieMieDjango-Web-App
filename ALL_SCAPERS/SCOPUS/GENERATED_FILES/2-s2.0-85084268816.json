In neuroscience, brain-imaging datasets are more commonly accompanied by dozens or hundreds of phenotypic subject descriptors on the behavioral, neural, and genomic level. The complexity of such \u201cbig data\u201d repositories offer new opportunities and pose new challenges for systems neuroscience. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a prototypical family of methods that is useful in identifying the links between variable sets from different modalities. Importantly, CCA is well suited to describing relationships across multiple sets of data, such as in recently available big biomedical datasets. Our primer discusses the rationale, promises, and pitfalls of CCA.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Big data", "Data science", "Deep phenotyping", "Machine learning", "Modality fusion"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084268816", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"57188834309": {"Name": "Wang H.T.", "AuthorID": "57188834309", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Sackler Center for Consciousness Science, University of Sussex"}, "7005623257": {"Name": "Smallwood J.", "AuthorID": "7005623257", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of York"}, "57203998200": {"Name": "Mourao-Miranda J.", "AuthorID": "57203998200", "AffiliationID": "60122566, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck University College London Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research, University College London"}, "57200983996": {"Name": "Xia C.H.", "AuthorID": "57200983996", "AffiliationID": "60003711, 60006297", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania"}, "18537988600": {"Name": "Satterthwaite T.D.", "AuthorID": "18537988600", "AffiliationID": "60003711, 60006297", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania"}, "15047396100": {"Name": "Bassett D.S.", "AuthorID": "15047396100", "AffiliationID": "60006297", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics & Astronomy, School of Arts & Sciences, University of Pennsylvania"}, "37021155400": {"Name": "Bzdok D.", "AuthorID": "37021155400", "AffiliationID": "60113142", "AffiliationName": "Mila - Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute"}}}
