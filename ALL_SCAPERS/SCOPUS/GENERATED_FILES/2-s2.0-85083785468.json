However, in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients, higher admission LDL-C and TG levels have been shown to be associated with better clinical outcomes - termed the \u2018lipid paradox\u2019. We studied the relationship between lipid profile obtained within 72 hours of presentation, and all-cause mortality (during hospitalization, at 30-days and 12-months), and rehospitalization for heart failure and non-fatal AMI at 12-months in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) patients treated by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We included 11543 STEMI and 8470 NSTEMI patients who underwent PCI in the Singapore Myocardial Infarction Registry between 2008\u20132015. NSTEMI patients were older (60.3 years vs 57.7 years, p < 0.001) and more likely to be female (22.4% vs 15.0%, p < 0.001). In NSTEMI, a lower LDL-C was paradoxically associated with worse outcomes for death during hospitalization, within 30-days and within 12-months (all p < 0.001), but adjustment eliminated this paradox. In contrast, the paradox for LDL-C persisted for all primary outcomes after adjustment in STEMI. For NSTEMI patients, a lower HDL-C was associated with a higher risk of death during hospitalization but in STEMI patients a lower HDL-C was paradoxically associated with a lower risk of death during hospitalization. For this endpoint, the interaction term for HDL-C and type of MI was significant even after adjustment. An elevated TG level was not protective after adjustment. These observations may be due to differing characteristics and underlying pathophysiological mechanisms in NSTEMI and STEMI.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Cholesterol, LDL", "Female", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Non-ST Elevated Myocardial Infarction", "Outcome Assessment, Health Care", "Percutaneous Coronary Intervention", "Registries", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Singapore", "ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction", "Time Factors", "Triglycerides"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083785468", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57189870044": {"Name": "Sia C.H.", "AuthorID": "57189870044", "AffiliationID": "60026680, 60017161", "AffiliationName": "Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"}, "7403011676": {"Name": "Tan H.C.", "AuthorID": "7403011676", "AffiliationID": "60026680, 60017161", "AffiliationName": "Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"}, "7102523113": {"Name": "Yeo T.C.", "AuthorID": "7102523113", "AffiliationID": "60026680, 60017161", "AffiliationName": "Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"}, "23388249600": {"Name": "Chan M.Y.Y.", "AuthorID": "23388249600", "AffiliationID": "60026680, 60017161", "AffiliationName": "Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"}, "6602976997": {"Name": "Hausenloy D.J.", "AuthorID": "6602976997", "AffiliationID": "60072429", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Research Center, College of Medical and Health Sciences, Asia University"}, "56844093200": {"Name": "Zheng H.", "AuthorID": "56844093200", "AffiliationID": "60095107", "AffiliationName": "Health Promotion Board, National Registry of Diseases Office"}, "57203726642": {"Name": "Foo L.L.", "AuthorID": "57203726642", "AffiliationID": "60095107", "AffiliationName": "Health Promotion Board, National Registry of Diseases Office"}, "55701539100": {"Name": "Ho A.F.W.", "AuthorID": "55701539100", "AffiliationID": "60004409", "AffiliationName": "National Heart Research Institute Singapore, National Heart Centre"}, "57211337944": {"Name": "Chong J.", "AuthorID": "57211337944", "AffiliationID": "60004409", "AffiliationName": "National Heart Research Institute Singapore, National Heart Centre"}, "53981151600": {"Name": "Bulluck H.", "AuthorID": "53981151600", "AffiliationID": "60017129", "AffiliationName": "Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"}, "55346238800": {"Name": "Foo D.", "AuthorID": "55346238800", "AffiliationID": "60002481", "AffiliationName": "Tan Tock Seng Hospital"}, "57216531901": {"Name": "Lim P.Z.Y.", "AuthorID": "57216531901", "AffiliationID": "108628205", "AffiliationName": "KhooTeck Puat Hospital"}, "57205155828": {"Name": "Liew B.W.", "AuthorID": "57205155828", "AffiliationID": "60013022", "AffiliationName": "Changi General Hospital"}, "57200000246": {"Name": "Chua T.S.J.", "AuthorID": "57200000246", "AffiliationID": "60004409", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, National Heart Centre"}}}
