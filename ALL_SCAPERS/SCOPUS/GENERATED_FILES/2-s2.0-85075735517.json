Tropical Medicine & International Health Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdObjective: Body dissatisfaction and eating disorders (ED) among young females may increase in limited-resource settings as exposure to media and higher-resource cultures increases. We examined ED prevalence and its predictors among adolescent girls in rural north-western Burkina Faso. Methods: Fieldworkers interviewed 696 female adolescents aged 12-20 years in the Nouna Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS). ED were evaluated using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5), self-perceived appearance and body ideal were measured using Thompson and Gray\u2019s Contour Drawing Rating Scale (CDRS) and eating disorder predictors by the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q). We assessed media exposure to magazines, radio, television, and the internet. Results: 16% of respondents had a BMI below WHO age-standardised 5th percentile, while 4% were above the 85th percentile; most respondents wanted to be larger. DSM-5 criteria for anorexia nervosa (AN) were fulfilled by four of 696 respondents (0.6%), those for bulimia nervosa by none, and those for binge eating disorder by two (0.3%). In multivariable regression, more AN symptoms were associated with greater EDE-Q body dissatisfaction, desiring a thinner body and a history of sexual harassment or assault, but not with media exposure. A thinner desired body was associated with greater media exposure, higher BMI z-score and greater EDE-Q disordered eating. Conclusion: ED were very rare in rural Burkinab\u00e9 female adolescents, but factors predictive of ED in higher-resource settings were also predictive of ED precursor symptoms here. Our findings suggest that increasing media exposure in resource-limited settings may lead to increased body dissatisfaction, and potentially to increased future ED prevalence.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anorexia nervosa", "binge eating disorder", "body dissatisfaction", "bulimia nervosa", "West Africa"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adolescent Health", "Age Factors", "Body Dysmorphic Disorders", "Body Image", "Body Mass Index", "Burkina Faso", "Child", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Feeding and Eating Disorders", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mass Media", "Risk Factors", "Sex Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Violence", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075735517", "SubjectAreas": [["Parasitology", "IMMU", "2405"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57192697441": {"Name": "Terhoeven V.", "AuthorID": "57192697441", "AffiliationID": "60003280", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Psychosocial Medicine, University Hospital Heidelberg"}, "23486763900": {"Name": "Nikendei C.", "AuthorID": "23486763900", "AffiliationID": "60003280", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Psychosocial Medicine, University Hospital Heidelberg"}, "8568789700": {"Name": "Friederich H.C.", "AuthorID": "8568789700", "AffiliationID": "60003280", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Psychosocial Medicine, University Hospital Heidelberg"}, "57215541738": {"Name": "B\u00e4rnighausen T.", "AuthorID": "57215541738", "AffiliationID": "60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute (AHRI)"}, "9941637000": {"Name": "Harling G.", "AuthorID": "9941637000", "AffiliationID": "60022098, 60032499", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology & Harvard Center for Population and Development Studies, Harvard T.H.
