Here, we test whether this facial action might be better conceptualized as a marker of emotional intensity, rather than genuineness per se, and examine its perceptual outcomes beyond smiling, in sad expressions. For smiles, we found ratings of emotional intensity (how happy a face is) were unable to fully account for the effect of Duchenne status (present vs. absent) on ratings of emotion genuineness. The Duchenne marker made a unique direct contribution to the perceived genuineness of smiles, supporting its reputation for signaling genuine emotion in smiling. In contrast, across 4 experiments, we found Duchenne sad expressions were not rated as any more genuine or sincere than non-Duchenne ones. The Duchenne marker did however make sad expressions look sadder and more negative, just like it made smiles look happier and more positive. Together, these findings argue the Duchenne marker has an important role in sad as well as smiling expressions, but is interpreted differently in sad expressions (contributions to intensity only) compared with smiles (emotion genuineness independently of intensity).", "AuthorKeywords": ["AU6", "Duchenne", "Facial expression", "Genuine", "Intensity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088833539", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"57218327134": {"Name": "Miller E.J.", "AuthorID": "57218327134", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "8280916700": {"Name": "Krumhuber E.G.", "AuthorID": "8280916700", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "35767721100": {"Name": "Dawel A.", "AuthorID": "35767721100", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
