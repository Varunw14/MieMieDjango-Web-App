All rights reserved.Purpose of reviewMRI-targeted prostate biopsy may be an attractive alternative to systematic biopsy for diagnosing clinically significant prostate cancer. In this narrative review, we discuss the new developments that have occurred in the advancement of MRI-targeted prostate biopsy, over the past 24 months.Recent findingsMRI-targeted biopsy offers enhanced diagnostic accuracy, when compared with the current standard of care of systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided (TRUS) biopsy, by decreasing the overall number of biopsies needed, maintaining or improving significant prostate cancer detection, and reducing the detection of clinically insignificant prostate cancer. The necessity of combining systematic prostate biopsy with MRI-targeted biopsy is still debated. The use of MRI-ultrasound fusion systems for lesion-targeting is promising for optimizing significant cancer detection, but recent evidence suggests that additional cognitive biopsy cores are still useful in detecting additional cancers.SummaryMRI-targeted biopsy in selected men with positive MRI offers a number of benefits over systematic biopsy in all men, and as such, may emerge as the new standard of care for the diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biparametric MRI", "focal saturation", "fusion biopsy", "multiparametric MRI", "prostate cancer", "targeted biopsy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biopsy", "Humans", "Image-Guided Biopsy", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Interventional", "Male", "Prostatic Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075960270", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"55192676400": {"Name": "Norris J.M.", "AuthorID": "55192676400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35336774700": {"Name": "Kasivisvanathan V.", "AuthorID": "35336774700", "AffiliationID": "60176242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust"}, "20433272000": {"Name": "Kinnaird A.", "AuthorID": "20433272000", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University of California, Los Angeles"}, "7102107953": {"Name": "Margolis D.J.", "AuthorID": "7102107953", "AffiliationID": "60007997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Weill-Cornell Medical College"}, "7003945883": {"Name": "Padhani A.R.", "AuthorID": "7003945883", "AffiliationID": "60006776", "AffiliationName": "Paul Strickland Scanner Centre, Mount Vernon Cancer Centre"}, "56261385500": {"Name": "Walz J.", "AuthorID": "56261385500", "AffiliationID": "60028690", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Institut Paoli-Calmettes Cancer Centre"}}}
