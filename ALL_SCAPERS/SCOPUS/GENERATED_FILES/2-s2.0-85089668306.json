The magnetic field introduced significant changes to both the microstructure and the dynamics of escaping high-concentration Ga plumes. Plume migration across the interface was quantified and correlated to simulations to demonstrate that thermoelectric magnetohydrodynamics (TEMHD) is the underlying mechanism. TEMHD introduced macrosegregation within the dendritic structure, leading to the formation of a stable \u201cchimney\u201d channel by increasing the solutal buoyancy in the flow direction. The resulting pressure difference across the solidification front introduced a secondary hydrodynamic phenomenon that subsequently caused solute plume migration.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Dendritic structures", "Experimental and numerical studies", "Macrosegregations", "Magnetic effects", "Plume migration", "Pressure differences", "Solidification fronts", "Transverse magnetic field"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089668306", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"35107313700": {"Name": "Kao A.", "AuthorID": "35107313700", "AffiliationID": "60021889", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Numerical Modelling and Process Analysis, Old Royal Naval College, University of Greenwich"}, "7005495330": {"Name": "Pericleous K.", "AuthorID": "7005495330", "AffiliationID": "60021889", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Numerical Modelling and Process Analysis, Old Royal Naval College, University of Greenwich"}, "7103199345": {"Name": "Shevchenko N.", "AuthorID": "7103199345", "AffiliationID": "60000086", "AffiliationName": "Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Institute of Fluid Dynamics"}, "57193317833": {"Name": "He S.", "AuthorID": "57193317833", "AffiliationID": "60023813, 60127868", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Advanced Special Steel & School of Materials Science and Engineering, Shanghai University"}, "7004291733": {"Name": "Eckert S.", "AuthorID": "7004291733", "AffiliationID": "60000086", "AffiliationName": "Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Institute of Fluid Dynamics"}, "8504683300": {"Name": "Lee P.D.", "AuthorID": "8504683300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
