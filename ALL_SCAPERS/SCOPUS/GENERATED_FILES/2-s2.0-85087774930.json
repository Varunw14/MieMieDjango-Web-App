We now know that in the majority of acute coronary syndromes, a thrombotic event is triggered either by the rupture or erosion of the so-called high-risk or \u2018vulnerable\u2019 plaque. However, accurately identifying the individual who is at significant risk of acute event remains the holy grail of preventive cardiology. To better stratify an individual's risk of developing and suffering a cardiovascular event, biomarkers are needed that can accurately predict coronary events and, if possible, monitor disease activity in response to medical or interventional therapies. In order to be able to understand the association of these biomarkers with the morphological substrate of high-risk plaques, intravascular imaging modalities can provide invaluable assistance. Novel imaging tools such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) have not only helped in identifying atherosclerotic plaque characteristics that are unstable but also in estimating global plaque burden. In this study, we provide an overview of our current knowledge of association of various inflammatory markers with atherosclerotic plaque characteristics seen on OCT.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomarkers", "Coronary artery disease", "Optical coherence tomography"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087774930", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"37018431500": {"Name": "Koganti S.", "AuthorID": "37018431500", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free Hospital"}, "6603035925": {"Name": "Rakhit R.D.", "AuthorID": "6603035925", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free Hospital"}, "26026341500": {"Name": "Karanasos A.", "AuthorID": "26026341500", "AffiliationID": "60003720, 60067083", "AffiliationName": "Hippokration Hospital, Athens Medical School"}, "57201853018": {"Name": "Regar E.", "AuthorID": "57201853018", "AffiliationID": "60019619", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital of Zurich"}}}
