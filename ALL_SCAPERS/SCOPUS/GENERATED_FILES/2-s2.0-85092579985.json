Their main point is to classify any future observations from the population which fall outside them as atypical and thus may warrant further investigation. As a reference range is constructed from a random sample from the population, the event \u2018a reference range contains (Formula presented.) of the population\u2019 is also random. Hence, all we can hope for is that such event has a large occurrence probability. In this paper we argue that some intervals, including the P prediction interval, are not suitable as reference ranges since there is a substantial probability that these intervals contain less than (Formula presented.) of the population, especially when the sample size is large. In contrast, a (Formula presented.) tolerance interval is designed to contain (Formula presented.) of the population with a pre-specified large confidence \u03b3 so it is eminently adequate as a reference range. An example based on real data illustrates the paper\u2019s key points.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Nonparametric prediction interval", "nonparametric tolerance interval", "prediction interval", "reference range", "tolerance interval"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092579985", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Health Information Management", "HEAL", "3605"]], "AuthorData": {"56980353000": {"Name": "Liu W.", "AuthorID": "56980353000", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Mathematical Sciences $and$ Southampton Statistical Sciences Research Institute, University of Southampton"}, "6701707614": {"Name": "Bretz F.", "AuthorID": "6701707614", "AffiliationID": "60009968", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Pharma AG"}, "26643625100": {"Name": "Cortina-Borja M.", "AuthorID": "26643625100", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Population, Policy and Practice Research and Teaching, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
