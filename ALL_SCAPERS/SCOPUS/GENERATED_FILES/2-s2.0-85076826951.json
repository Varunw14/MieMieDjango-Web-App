This has had little impact on the rate of drug resistance over time, or impact on comorbidities such as learning and behaviour particularly in the early onset epilepsies. The advent of advanced neuroimaging and genomics has revealed the cause of the epilepsy in a much higher percentage, and advanced our knowledge as to the underlying pathophysiology. This has given us the opportunity to turn to the possibility of interventional treatment, targeting the underlying cause, and consequently the possibility of changing the natural history of disease. Here we review the options open to us, and the evidence to date.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Disease modification", "Epilepsy", "Epileptic encephalopathy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Developmental Disabilities", "Disease Management", "Genetic Therapy", "Humans", "Molecular Targeted Therapy", "Seizures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076826951", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"9250118200": {"Name": "Cross J.H.", "AuthorID": "9250118200", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL NIHR BRC Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57200910377": {"Name": "Lagae L.", "AuthorID": "57200910377", "AffiliationID": "60031069", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Neurology, University Hospitals Leuven"}}}
