XLMTM fibres display a population of nuclei mispositioned in the centre. In the present study, we aimed to explore whether positioning and overall distribution of nuclei affects cellular organization and contractile function, thereby contributing to muscle weakness in this disease. We also assessed whether gene therapy alters nuclear arrangement and function. We used tissue from human patients and animal models, including XLMTM dogs that had received increasing doses of recombinant AAV8 vector restoring MTM1 expression (rAAV8-cMTM1). We then used single isolated muscle fibres to analyze nuclear organization and contractile function. In addition to the expected mislocalization of nuclei in the centre of muscle fibres, a novel form of nuclear mispositioning was observed: irregular spacing between those located at the fibre periphery, and an overall increased number of nuclei, leading to dramatically smaller and inconsistent myonuclear domains. Nuclear mislocalization was associated with decreases in global nuclear synthetic activity, contractile protein content and intrinsic myofilament force production. A contractile deficit originating at the myofilaments, rather than mechanical interference by centrally positioned nuclei, was supported by experiments in regenerated mouse muscle. Systemic administration of rAAV8-cMTM1 at doses higher than 2.5 \u00d7 1013vg kg\u22121 allowed a full rescue of all these cellular defects in XLMTM dogs. Altogether, these findings identify previously unrecognized pathological mechanisms in human and animal XLMTM, associated with myonuclear defects and contractile filament function. These defects can be reversed by gene therapy restoring MTM1 expression in dogs with XLMTM.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Congenital myopathy", "Force production", "Myofilament", "Myonuclear domain", "Myotubularin", "Skeletal muscle"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092799337", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"57192690938": {"Name": "Ross J.A.", "AuthorID": "57192690938", "AffiliationID": "60100024, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "British Heart Foundation Centre of Excellence, School of Cardiovascular Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, King\u2019s College London"}, "57188588463": {"Name": "Levy Y.", "AuthorID": "57188588463", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Human and Applied Physiological Sciences, School of Basic and Medical Biosciences, Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, King\u2019s College London"}, "6507058079": {"Name": "Ochala J.", "AuthorID": "6507058079", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"}, "57194505157": {"Name": "Tasfaout H.", "AuthorID": "57194505157", "AffiliationID": "60103368, 60017969, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Institut de G\u00e9n\u00e9tique Et de Biologie Mol\u00e9culaire Et Cellulaire (IGBMC), INSERM U1258, CNRS UMR7104, Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg"}, "13404248400": {"Name": "Cowling B.S.", "AuthorID": "13404248400", "AffiliationID": "60103368, 60017969, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Institut de G\u00e9n\u00e9tique Et de Biologie Mol\u00e9culaire Et Cellulaire (IGBMC), INSERM U1258, CNRS UMR7104, Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg"}, "57203029477": {"Name": "Laporte J.", "AuthorID": "57203029477", "AffiliationID": "60103368, 60017969, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Institut de G\u00e9n\u00e9tique Et de Biologie Mol\u00e9culaire Et Cellulaire (IGBMC), INSERM U1258, CNRS UMR7104, Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg"}, "35601353000": {"Name": "Morgan J.", "AuthorID": "35601353000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, University College London"}, "6604041277": {"Name": "Zanoteli E.", "AuthorID": "6604041277", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Faculdade de Medicina (FMUSP), Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "16937036100": {"Name": "Romero N.B.", "AuthorID": "16937036100", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60015622, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Neuromuscular Morphology Unit, Myology Institute, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Centre de R\u00e9f\u00e9rence de Pathologie Neuromusculaire Nord/Est/Ile-de-France (APHP), GH Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re"}, "7402516554": {"Name": "Lowe D.A.", "AuthorID": "7402516554", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "Division of Rehabilitation Science and Division of Physical Therapy, Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, University of Minnesota"}, "7006738404": {"Name": "Jungbluth H.", "AuthorID": "7006738404", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "35725759400": {"Name": "Lawlor M.W.", "AuthorID": "35725759400", "AffiliationID": "60012553", "AffiliationName": "Division of Paediatric Pathology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and Neuroscience Research Center, Medical College of Wisconsin"}, "16233987200": {"Name": "Mack D.L.", "AuthorID": "16233987200", "AffiliationID": "60028548, 60015481", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Washington"}}}
