In this paper, an alternative flowsheet for spent nuclear fuel reprocessing is proposed, based on small-scale extractors to overcome some of the issues related to the conventional technologies, such as solvent degradation, size and nuclear criticality control. The main goal of the process is to preclude the risk of nuclear proliferation, hence a mixed uranium/plutonium oxide is produced instead of pure plutonium. A superstructure optimisation based framework has been used to identify a process with several benefits over the conventional process. Novel flow configurations and organic solvent composition have been investigated. A large number of components and chemical reactions are included in the framework. The resulting model is a mixed integer nonlinear optimisation problem, implemented in the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS). The most promising flowsheet identified is more cost effective than the conventional one. Furthermore, advantages in terms of safety and separation efficiency have been achieved. It was found that increasing the inner diameter of the small channels up to 2.5 mm, as well as increasing the tributyl phosphate fraction in the organic solvent, are advantageous.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Liquid\u2013liquid extraction", "Optimisation", "Process design", "Small channels", "Spent nuclear fuel reprocessing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Liquid extraction", "Non-linear optimisation", "Nuclear criticality control", "Optimisations", "Process intensification", "Separation efficiency", "Small channels", "Spent nuclear fuel reprocessing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073699909", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"57115556200": {"Name": "Bascone D.", "AuthorID": "57115556200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Systems Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "7004488806": {"Name": "Angeli P.", "AuthorID": "7004488806", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Systems Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "7006429775": {"Name": "Fraga E.", "AuthorID": "7006429775", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Systems Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}}}
