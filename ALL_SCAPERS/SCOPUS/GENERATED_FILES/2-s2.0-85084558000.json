Dimitriou and Alison H.S. Cook 1998. All rights reserved.While it cannot be denied that Hong Kong has encountered serious land-use/transport problems as a result of its fast growing economy, its high population density levels and limited territorial space, of all the cities in the world facing difficulties, it is uniquely placed to provide a visionary response. There are several reasons for this. First, unlike most other cities, Hong Kong does not have a hinterland of any significance to finance and support. This leaves the public purse with higher levels of public revenue to spend on itself than comparable cities (with the possible exception of Singapore). Second, Hong Kong has benefited from a competent administration cadre during its colonial years of governance supported by a talented entrepreneurial class-a combination not often found elsewhere 1. Third, no other city in the capitalist world possesses the kind of control over its land use as the Government of Hong Kong. The city enjoys this advantage by virtue of almost all land in the territory being Crown Land (i.e. land in public ownership). This places the Hong Kong Administration in a position to confer leasing rights to the private sector from which it collects substantial rent and development premiums. Fourth, few cities in the world subsidise the housing of their inhabitants to the same degree as Hong Kong. About half of the territory's inhabitants reside in public housing, and because such housing, is often provided in new towns or estates that are equivalent to city populations in other parts of the world, theoretically this enables government planners to coordinate land-use and transport planning efforts more easily (Figure 1). Fifth, and last of all, the motorcar culture in Hong Kong has not yet established firm roots among the mass of its population despite the recent concern shown by government and academics about the rising levels of traffic congestion attributed to this mode of transport (Transport Department 1994). This situation is in part a result of the excellent public transport services but also attributable to the high cost of owning and operating a private car, and the limited road and parking space available 2.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084558000", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"6603844219": {"Name": "Dimitriou H.T.", "AuthorID": "6603844219", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7401880909": {"Name": "Cook A.H.S.", "AuthorID": "7401880909", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "University of Hong Kong"}}}
