All rights reserved.Orosh\u00e1za site no. 10 (Southeast Hungary) contains the partially excavated archaeological remains of an 11\u201313th century CE Muslim merchant village and its cemetery located in close proximity to Christian villages of the same era. The skeleton of a young woman (grave no. 16) from the last phase of the cemetery use was identified with rhinomaxillary lesions associated with lepromatous leprosy. The right parietal bone also exhibited signs of cranial trauma, possibly caused by symbolic trepanation, a well-known ritual practice in the 9\u201311th century CE Carpathian Basin. The retrospective diagnosis of the disease was supported by ancient DNA analysis, as the samples were positive for Mycobacterium leprae aDNA, shown to be of genotype 3. Contrary to the general practice of the era, the body of the young female with severe signs of leprosy was interred among the regular graves of the Muslim cemetery in Orosh\u00e1za, which may reflect the unique cultural background of the community.", "AuthorKeywords": ["11\u201313th century CE", "Hungary", "Leprosy", "Muslim cemetery", "Mycobacterium leprae aDNA"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072992918", "SubjectAreas": [["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"]], "AuthorData": {"56125703000": {"Name": "Bal\u00e1zs J.", "AuthorID": "56125703000", "AffiliationID": "60027332", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Anthropology, University of Szeged"}, "36943150700": {"Name": "Bereczki Z.", "AuthorID": "36943150700", "AffiliationID": "60027332", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Anthropology, University of Szeged"}, "55977790700": {"Name": "Marcsik A.", "AuthorID": "55977790700", "AffiliationID": "60027332", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Anthropology, University of Szeged"}, "57217884974": {"Name": "Tihanyi B.", "AuthorID": "57217884974", "AffiliationID": "60027332", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Anthropology, University of Szeged"}, "7103079286": {"Name": "Moln\u00e1r E.", "AuthorID": "7103079286", "AffiliationID": "60027332", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Anthropology, University of Szeged"}, "6601976533": {"Name": "P\u00e1lfi G.", "AuthorID": "6601976533", "AffiliationID": "60027332", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Anthropology, University of Szeged"}, "57196720694": {"Name": "R\u00f3zsa Z.", "AuthorID": "57196720694", "AffiliationID": "119760781", "AffiliationName": null}, "6602166128": {"Name": "Karlinger K.", "AuthorID": "6602166128", "AffiliationID": "60024812", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Semmelweis University"}, "56423749500": {"Name": "P\u00f6l\u00f6skei G.", "AuthorID": "56423749500", "AffiliationID": "60024812", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Semmelweis University"}, "6701847443": {"Name": "Donoghue H.D.", "AuthorID": "6701847443", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Microbiology, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}}}
