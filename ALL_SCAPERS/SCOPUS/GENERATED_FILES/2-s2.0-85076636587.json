We study a fragment of a large quiescent filament observed on May 29, 2017 by the Interferometric BIdimensional Spectropolarimeter (IBIS) mounted at the Dunn Solar Telescope. We focus on its quiescent stage prior to its eruption. Aims. We analyse the spectral observations obtained in the H\u03b1 line to derive the thermodynamic properties of the plasma of the observed fragment of the filament. Methods. We used a 2D filament model employing radiative transfer computations under conditions that depart from the local thermodynamic equilibrium. We employed a forward modelling technique in which we used the 2D model to produce synthetic H\u03b1 line profiles that we compared with the observations. We then found the set of model input parameters, which produces synthetic spectra with the best agreement with observations. Results. Our analysis shows that one part of the observed fragment of the filament is cooler, denser, and more dynamic than its other part that is hotter, less dense, and more quiescent. The derived temperatures in the first part range from 6000K to 10 000K and in the latter part from 11 000K to 14 000 K. The gas pressure is 0.2-0.4 dyn cm-2 in the first part and around 0.15 dyn cm-2 in the latter part. The more dynamic nature of the first part is characterised by the line-of-sight velocities with absolute values of 6-7 km s-1 and microturbulent velocities of 8-9 km s-1. On the other hand, the latter part exhibits line-of-sight velocities with absolute values 0-2.5 km s-1 and microturbulent velocities of 4-6 km s-1.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Line: Profiles", "Methods: Data analysis", "Methods: numerical", "Radiative transfer", "Sun: Filaments, prominences", "Techniques: Spectroscopic"], "IndexKeywords": ["Line: Profiles", "Methods: numericals", "Methods:data analysis", "Sun: filaments , prominences", "Techniques: spectroscopic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076636587", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"7402624693": {"Name": "Schwartz P.", "AuthorID": "7402624693", "AffiliationID": "60032496, 60010330", "AffiliationName": "Astronomical Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences"}, "8860730100": {"Name": "Gun\u00e1r S.", "AuthorID": "8860730100", "AffiliationID": "60001847, 60031135", "AffiliationName": "Astronomical Institute, Czech Academy of Sciences"}, "7003895510": {"Name": "Heinzel P.", "AuthorID": "7003895510", "AffiliationID": "60001847, 60031135", "AffiliationName": "Astronomical Institute, Czech Academy of Sciences"}, "57200215144": {"Name": "Jenkins J.M.", "AuthorID": "57200215144", "AffiliationID": "60084281", "AffiliationName": "UCL-Mullard Space Science Laboratory, Holmbury St. Mary"}, "57211231301": {"Name": "Long D.M.", "AuthorID": "57211231301", "AffiliationID": "60084281", "AffiliationName": "UCL-Mullard Space Science Laboratory, Holmbury St. Mary"}, "55662967800": {"Name": "Choudhary D.P.", "AuthorID": "55662967800", "AffiliationID": "60020975", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, California State University"}}}
