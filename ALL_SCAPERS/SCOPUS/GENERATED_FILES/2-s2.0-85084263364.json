Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdCardiovascular diseases are the worldwide leading cause of mortality. Cardiovascular diseases are noncommunicable conditions with a complex pathogenesis, and their clinical manifestations include major cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Epidemiologic evidence suggests a consistent association between periodontitis and increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. Some evidence supports a beneficial effect of the treatment of periodontitis on both surrogate and hard cardiovascular outcomes. This narrative review has been conducted as an update of the most recent evidence on the effects of periodontitis treatment on cardiovascular outcomes since the last commissioned review of the European Federation of Periodontology-American Academy of Periodontology World Workshop in 2012. Newer evidence originating from published randomized controlled trials confirms a positive effect of periodontal treatment on surrogate measures of cardiovascular diseases, whereas there have been no randomized controlled trials investigating the effect of periodontal treatment on the incidence of cardiovascular disease events such as myocardial infarction and stroke. In conclusion, there is sufficient evidence from observational and experimental studies on surrogate cardiovascular measures to justify the design and conduct of appropriately powered randomized controlled trials investigating the effect of effective periodontal interventions on cardiovascular disease outcomes (ie, myocardial infarction and stroke) with adequate control of traditional cardiovascular risk factors.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cardiovascular Diseases", "Humans", "Myocardial Infarction", "Periodontics", "Periodontitis", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084263364", "SubjectAreas": [["Periodontics", "DENT", "3506"]], "AuthorData": {"56375663600": {"Name": "Orlandi M.", "AuthorID": "56375663600", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Periodontology Unit, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "6507515725": {"Name": "D'Aiuto F.", "AuthorID": "6507515725", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Periodontology Unit, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "36879606000": {"Name": "Graziani F.", "AuthorID": "36879606000", "AffiliationID": "60082061", "AffiliationName": "Sub-Unit of Periodontology, Halitosis and Periodontal Medicine, University Hospital of Pisa"}}}
