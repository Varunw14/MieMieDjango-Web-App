In this study we aim to (a) assess the validity of the EasyOne Pro LAB (MBWndd) in an in vitro lung model, (b) assess the feasibility, repeatability, and reproducibility of MBWndd and (c) compare outcomes with the Exhalyzer D (MBWEM) and body plethysmography. Methods: In vitro, functional residual capacity (FRC) measurements were assessed using a lung model under quasi-physiological conditions and compared to measured FRC. In vivo plethysmography and MBW were performed in a prospective study of children at two visits (n = 45 healthy; n = 41 cystic fibrosis [CF]). Bland-Altman plots were used to compare agreement between FRC and lung clearance index (LCI) measurements. Results: In vitro FRCndd measurements were repeatable but lung volumes were underestimated (mean relative difference \u22125.4% (limits of agreement [LA] \u22129.6%; \u22121.1%), 95% confidence interval (CI) \u22126.27; \u22124.45). In vivo, compared to plethysmography, FRCndd was consistently lower (\u221219.3% [\u221240.5; 1.9], 95% CI [\u221223.9; \u221214.7]), and showed a volume dependency. LCIndd values were also higher in children with smaller lung volumes. The within-test coefficient of variation of the FRCndd and LCIndd were 4.9% in health, and 5.6% and 6.9% in CF respectively. LCIndd was reproducible between-visits (mean relative difference [LA] \u22123.7% [\u221214.8, \u22127.5; 95% CI \u22126.6; \u22120.73] in health [n = 17] and 0.34% [\u221213.2, 22.8; 95% CI \u22125.0; 5.69] in CF [n = 23]). When calculated using the same algorithm, LCIndd was similar to LCIEM in health. Conclusions: MBWndd measurements are feasible, repeatable, and reproducible, however, MBW-derived outcomes are not interchangeable with MBWEM.", "AuthorKeywords": ["function pulmonary testing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Breath Tests", "Child", "Cystic Fibrosis", "Female", "Humans", "Lung", "Male", "Nitrogen", "Plethysmography, Whole Body", "Reproducibility of Results", "Respiratory Function Tests"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085567324", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"57210820258": {"Name": "Isaac S.M.", "AuthorID": "57210820258", "AffiliationID": "60030319", "AffiliationName": "Translational Medicine, Research Institute, Hospital for Sick Children"}, "57210815792": {"Name": "Jensen R.", "AuthorID": "57210815792", "AffiliationID": "60030319", "AffiliationName": "Translational Medicine, Research Institute, Hospital for Sick Children"}, "22636433100": {"Name": "Stanojevic S.", "AuthorID": "22636433100", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "University of Toronto"}, "56214449500": {"Name": "Ratjen F.", "AuthorID": "56214449500", "AffiliationID": "60030319", "AffiliationName": "Division of Respiratory Medicine, Hospital for Sick Children"}, "36704456200": {"Name": "Anagnostopoulou P.", "AuthorID": "36704456200", "AffiliationID": "60099369, 60020486", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Anatomy, University of Bern"}, "16203004400": {"Name": "Latzin P.", "AuthorID": "16203004400", "AffiliationID": "60000908, 60020486", "AffiliationName": "Division of Respiratory Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, University Children's Hospital of Bern, University of Bern"}, "37098203500": {"Name": "Singer F.", "AuthorID": "37098203500", "AffiliationID": "60000908, 60020486", "AffiliationName": "Division of Respiratory Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, University Children's Hospital of Bern, University of Bern"}, "7404981189": {"Name": "Davies J.C.", "AuthorID": "7404981189", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60009009, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart & Lung Institute, Imperial College London and Royal Brompton Hospital"}, "35875318300": {"Name": "Saunders C.", "AuthorID": "35875318300", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60009009, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart & Lung Institute, Imperial College London and Royal Brompton Hospital"}, "57193790833": {"Name": "Short C.", "AuthorID": "57193790833", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60009009, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart & Lung Institute, Imperial College London and Royal Brompton Hospital"}, "7003916542": {"Name": "Gappa M.", "AuthorID": "7003916542", "AffiliationID": "60015895, 60009948", "AffiliationName": "Evangelisches Krankenhaus D\u00fcsseldorf, Formerly Marienhospital Wesel"}, "24482512400": {"Name": "Zwitserloot A.", "AuthorID": "24482512400", "AffiliationID": "60070240, 60006027", "AffiliationName": "University Medical Centre Groningen, Beatrix Children's Hospital"}}}
