Previously this conceptual model has been evidenced with children who can already read, however as orthographic knowledge can be used to complete phonological awareness tasks it cannot be said definitively that it is prosodic sensitivity influencing reading and spelling and not the reverse. Therefore, the present study sought to test the model in a longitudinal study conducted at the outset of reading development. A sample of 4- to 5-year-old English-speaking children (N = 101) were assessed for their prosodic sensitivity, vocabulary knowledge, phonological and morphological awareness, and 1 year later (N = 93) for their word reading and spelling. A path analysis revealed that the conceptual model provides an adequate fit to our sample data: prosodic sensitivity in pre-reading children predicts reading and spelling indirectly through other emergent literacy skills. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to models of literacy development and literacy instruction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Literacy", "Phonology", "Prosodic sensitivity", "Prosody", "Rhythm"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089014059", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"16027858000": {"Name": "Critten S.", "AuthorID": "16027858000", "AffiliationID": "60017326", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychological, Sociological and Behavioural Sciences, Coventry University"}, "57194580545": {"Name": "Cunnane H.", "AuthorID": "57194580545", "AffiliationID": "60017326", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychological, Sociological and Behavioural Sciences, Coventry University"}, "35345480800": {"Name": "Pillinger C.", "AuthorID": "35345480800", "AffiliationID": "60017326", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychological, Sociological and Behavioural Sciences, Coventry University"}, "26539964700": {"Name": "Holliman A.J.", "AuthorID": "26539964700", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}, "55727456700": {"Name": "Hughes D.J.", "AuthorID": "55727456700", "AffiliationID": "60026051, 60003771", "AffiliationName": "Alliance Manchester Business School, University of Manchester"}, "57220846626": {"Name": "Wood C.", "AuthorID": "57220846626", "AffiliationID": "60006029", "AffiliationName": "School of Social Sciences, Nottingham Trent University"}, "9233069700": {"Name": "Deacon S.H.", "AuthorID": "9233069700", "AffiliationID": "60015913", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Dalhousie University"}}}
