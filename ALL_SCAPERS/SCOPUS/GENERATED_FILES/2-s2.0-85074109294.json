Taking a social cognition approach, we examine entrepreneur stereotypes by identifying patterns in stereotype content dimensions for entrepreneurs and related job titles. The title of entrepreneur is complex incorporating both business and innovation components. Across three studies we compare warmth and competence dimensions of the title of entrepreneur with those of a business leader (CEO), inventor/innovator (scientist), and a role requiring both creativity and business skills (advertiser). We find that while entrepreneurs are consistently seen as less competent than either a CEO or scientist and more so than an advertiser, they tend to be seen as warmer than these professionals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Competence", "Entrepreneur", "Job titles", "Social cognition", "Stereotypes", "Warmth"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074109294", "SubjectAreas": [["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"57211762923": {"Name": "Berry J.W.", "AuthorID": "57211762923", "AffiliationID": "60176025", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Management"}, "57220819246": {"Name": "Sanchez J.", "AuthorID": "57220819246", "AffiliationID": "60176025", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Management"}}}
