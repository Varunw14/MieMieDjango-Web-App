Even less well understood are the ways in which those who were tainted by complicity reframed their personal life stories. Millions had been willing facilitators, witting beneficiaries, or passive (and perhaps unhappily helpless) witnesses of Nazi persecution; many had been actively involved in sustaining Nazi rule; perhaps a quarter of a million had personally killed Jewish civilians, and several million had direct knowledge of genocide. How did these people re-envision their own lives after Nazism? And how did they reinterpret their own former behaviors-their actions and inaction-in light of public confrontations with Nazi crimes and constructions of perpetrators in trials? Going beyond well-trodden debates about overcoming the past, this paper explores patterns of personal memory among East and West Germans after Nazism.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091634945", "SubjectAreas": [["History", "ARTS", "1202"]], "AuthorData": {"26657301000": {"Name": "Fulbrook M.", "AuthorID": "26657301000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of European Languages Culture and Society [SELCS], University College London"}}}
