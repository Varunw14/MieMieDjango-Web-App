However, increasing shortage of donor corneas as well as high risk of rejection in some corneal diseases remain two major problems, which limit the success of corneal transplantation. Corneal neovascularization is considered as one of the main risk factors of graft failure. Different cell-free biosynthetic scaffolds fabricated from collagens or collagen-like peptides are being tested as donor cornea substitutes (DCS). Here, we report for the first-time composite biosynthetic DCS with integrated sustained release system of anti-VEGF drug, bevacizumab and their preliminary in vitro validation. We have tethered gold nanoparticles with bevacizumab and integrated into a collagen-based cell-free hydrogel scaffold. Developed grafts preserved good optical properties and were confirmed not toxic to human corneal epithelial cells. Bevacizumab has been shown to constantly releasing from the DCS up to 3 weeks and preserved its anti-angiogenic properties. These results provide background for further use of infused composite biosynthetic DCS with integrated nanosystem of bevacizumab sustained release in corneal disease accompanied by neovascularisation where conventional corneal transplantation might fail.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bevacizumab sustained release", "Biotechnology", "Cornea scaffold", "Gold nanoparticles", "Materials science", "Nanotechnology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092003627", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"37001527600": {"Name": "Buznyk O.", "AuthorID": "37001527600", "AffiliationID": "60091832", "AffiliationName": "Filatov Institute of Eye Diseases and Tissue Therapy of the NAMS of Ukraine"}, "56023870200": {"Name": "Azharuddin M.", "AuthorID": "56023870200", "AffiliationID": "60009358", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Link\u00f6ping University"}, "55547121177": {"Name": "Islam M.M.", "AuthorID": "55547121177", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60028842, 60009982", "AffiliationName": "Schepens Eye Research Institute, Harvard Medical School, Harvard University"}, "7005259573": {"Name": "Fagerholm P.", "AuthorID": "7005259573", "AffiliationID": "60009358", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Link\u00f6ping University"}, "28567902700": {"Name": "Pasyechnikova N.", "AuthorID": "28567902700", "AffiliationID": "60091832", "AffiliationName": "Filatov Institute of Eye Diseases and Tissue Therapy of the NAMS of Ukraine"}, "14067825400": {"Name": "Patra H.K.", "AuthorID": "14067825400", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Cambridge University"}}}
