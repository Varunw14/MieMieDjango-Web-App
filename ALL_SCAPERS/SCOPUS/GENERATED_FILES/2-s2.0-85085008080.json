KGaA, WeinheimIn this study a bispidine ligand has been applied to the complexation of gallium(III) and radiolabelled with gallium-68 for the first time. Despite its 5-coordinate nature, the resulting complex is stable in serum for over two hours, demonstrating a ligand system well matched to the imaging window of gallium-68 positron emission tomography (PET). To show the versatility of the bispidine ligand and its potential use in PET, the bifunctional chelator was conjugated to a porphyrin, producing a PET/PDT-theranostic, which showed the same level of stability to serum as the non-conjugated gallium-68 complex. The PET/PDT complex killed >90 % of HT-29 cells upon light irradiation at 50 \u03bcm. This study shows bispidines have the versatility to be used as a ligand system for gallium-68 in PET.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bispidine", "gallium-68", "porphyrin", "radiochemistry", "theranostic"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bi-functional", "Ht-29 cells", "Ligand system", "Light irradiations", "Positron emission tomography (PET)", "Theranostic agents", "Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic", "Chelating Agents", "Gallium", "Gallium Radioisotopes", "Humans", "Ligands", "Porphyrins", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Theranostic Nanomedicine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085008080", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"57191545771": {"Name": "Price T.W.", "AuthorID": "57191545771", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Imaging Chemistry and Biology, School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "30767854300": {"Name": "Stasiuk G.J.", "AuthorID": "30767854300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Imaging Chemistry and Biology, School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "57202921659": {"Name": "Yap S.Y.", "AuthorID": "57202921659", "AffiliationID": "60030469", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry, School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, University of Hull"}, "9744197500": {"Name": "Savoie H.", "AuthorID": "9744197500", "AffiliationID": "60030469", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry, School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, University of Hull"}, "7202685730": {"Name": "Boyle R.W.", "AuthorID": "7202685730", "AffiliationID": "60030469", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry, School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, University of Hull"}, "57193220384": {"Name": "Gillet R.", "AuthorID": "57193220384", "AffiliationID": "60103368, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "Equipe de Synth\u00e8se pour l'Analyse (SynPA), CNRS, IPHC UMR 7178, Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg"}, "6603884087": {"Name": "Charbonni\u00e8re L.J.", "AuthorID": "6603884087", "AffiliationID": "60103368, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "Equipe de Synth\u00e8se pour l'Analyse (SynPA), CNRS, IPHC UMR 7178, Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg"}, "17434944500": {"Name": "Nonat A.M.", "AuthorID": "17434944500", "AffiliationID": "60103368, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "Equipe de Synth\u00e8se pour l'Analyse (SynPA), CNRS, IPHC UMR 7178, Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg"}}}
