Ecography published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Nordic Society OikosThe analysis of interaction networks across spatial environmental gradients is a powerful approach to investigate the responses of communities to global change. Using a combination of DNA metabarcoding and traditional molecular methods we built bipartite Drosophila \u2013 parasitoid food webs from six Australian rainforest sites across gradients spanning 850 m in elevation and 5\u00b0C in mean temperature. Our cost-effective hierarchical approach to network reconstruction separated the determination of host frequencies from the detection and quantification of interactions. The food webs comprised 5\u20139 host and 5\u201311 parasitoid species at each site, and showed a lower incidence of parasitism at high elevation. Despite considerable turnover in the relative abundance of host Drosophila species, and contrary to some previous results, we did not detect significant changes to fundamental metrics of network structure including nestedness and specialisation with elevation. Advances in community ecology depend on data from a combination of methodological approaches. It is therefore especially valuable to develop model study systems for sets of closely-interacting species that are diverse enough to be representative, yet still amenable to field and laboratory experiments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DNA metabarcoding", "Drosophila", "elevational gradients", "host\u2013parasitoid", "quantiative network"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096640284", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"]], "AuthorData": {"55660380400": {"Name": "Jeffs C.T.", "AuthorID": "55660380400", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Zoology, Univ. of Oxford"}, "57195716950": {"Name": "Terry J.C.D.", "AuthorID": "57195716950", "AffiliationID": "60105356, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, Queen Mary Univ. of London"}, "7007014517": {"Name": "Lewis O.T.", "AuthorID": "7007014517", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Zoology, Univ. of Oxford"}, "6506583370": {"Name": "Higgie M.", "AuthorID": "6506583370", "AffiliationID": "60019870", "AffiliationName": "College of Science and Engineering, James Cook Univ."}, "57220048938": {"Name": "Jandov\u00e1 A.", "AuthorID": "57220048938", "AffiliationID": "60013029, 60031135", "AffiliationName": "Biology Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Inst. of Entomology"}, "57199152160": {"Name": "Konvi\u010dkov\u00e1 H.", "AuthorID": "57199152160", "AffiliationID": "60013029, 60031135", "AffiliationName": "Biology Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Inst. of Entomology"}, "57209222418": {"Name": "Brown J.J.", "AuthorID": "57209222418", "AffiliationID": "60009424", "AffiliationName": "Univ. of South Bohemia, Faculty of Science"}, "57189629319": {"Name": "Lue C.H.", "AuthorID": "57189629319", "AffiliationID": "60013029, 60031135", "AffiliationName": "Biology Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Inst. of Entomology"}, "23469751300": {"Name": "Hr\u010dek J.", "AuthorID": "23469751300", "AffiliationID": "60013029, 60031135", "AffiliationName": "Biology Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Inst. of Entomology"}, "7006325720": {"Name": "Schiffer M.", "AuthorID": "7006325720", "AffiliationID": "60019870", "AffiliationName": "Daintree Rainforest Observatory, James Cook Univ."}, "16316583200": {"Name": "O'Brien E.K.", "AuthorID": "16316583200", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, Univ. of Bristol"}, "7004251123": {"Name": "Bridle J.", "AuthorID": "7004251123", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Genetics, Environment and Evolution, Univ.
