However, it is well known that approximately 90% of B-cell epitopes (BCEs) are discontinuous in nature making it difficult to mimic them for creating vaccines. In this study, the degree of discontinuity in B-cell epitopes and their conformational nature is examined. The discontinuity of B-cell epitopes is analyzed by defining \u2018regions\u2019 (consisting of at least three antibody-contacting residues each separated by \u22643 residues) and small fragments (antibody-contacting residues that do not satisfy the requirements for a region). Secondly, an algorithm has been developed that classifies each region's shape as straight, curved or folded on the basis that straight and folded regions are more likely to retain their native conformation as isolated peptides. We have investigated the structures of 488 B-cell epitopes from which 1282 regions and 1018 fragments have been identified. 90% of epitopes have five or fewer regions and five or fewer fragments with 14% containing only one region and 4% being truly linear (i.e. having one region and no fragments). Of the 1282 regions, 508 are straight in shape, 626 are curved and 148 are folded.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antibody\u2013antigen interactions", "Antigen", "Discontinuous epitopes", "Epitope conformation", "Protein conformation", "Protein structure"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antibodies", "Epitope Mapping", "Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte", "Protein Conformation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072279970", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"55806816100": {"Name": "Ferdous S.", "AuthorID": "55806816100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "55708401700": {"Name": "Martin A.C.R.", "AuthorID": "55708401700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "26433396900": {"Name": "Kelm S.", "AuthorID": "26433396900", "AffiliationID": "60068605", "AffiliationName": "UCB Pharma"}, "7402604853": {"Name": "Baker T.S.", "AuthorID": "7402604853", "AffiliationID": "60068605", "AffiliationName": "UCB Pharma"}, "15734441500": {"Name": "Shi J.", "AuthorID": "15734441500", "AffiliationID": "60108609, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}}}
