We reevaluate this argument in the light of a neglected alternative analysis, namely that matrix-clause intervention is the result of extraposition of the embedded predicate. We show that this analysis gives a better account of matrix-clause intervention than raising to object. Our arguments are based on the scopal properties of the embedded subject and on the order among multiple intervening elements. We also consider various mixed analyses that feature both raising to object and extraposition. These turn out to be conceptually awkward and empirically flawed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078458286", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"6603228228": {"Name": "Neeleman A.", "AuthorID": "6603228228", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Research Department of Linguistics"}, "57200110932": {"Name": "Payne A.", "AuthorID": "57200110932", "AffiliationID": "60029227", "AffiliationName": "Haverford College"}}}
