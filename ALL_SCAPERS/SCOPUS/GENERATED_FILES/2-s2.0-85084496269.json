We propose a mechanism for explaining variations in the prices of intermediates as a function of importer characteristics, wherein production is vulnerable to failure and the probability of failure declines in the quality of intermediates. Higher wages mean a greater opportunity cost of failure, leading to a stronger demand for high-quality intermediates where firms face higher wages. We find empirical support for this mechanism in the case of intermediate goods using IV regressions. In addition, our findings indicate that while the cost of labour explains about one fifth of variation in imported intermediate prices, it is a non-significant determinant of imported final goods prices.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084496269", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"36021820800": {"Name": "Bekkers E.", "AuthorID": "36021820800", "AffiliationID": "60015357", "AffiliationName": "World Trade Organization"}, "55963863000": {"Name": "Francois J.", "AuthorID": "55963863000", "AffiliationID": "60074276, 60020486", "AffiliationName": "University of Bern, World Trade Institute"}, "14031660000": {"Name": "Manchin M.", "AuthorID": "14031660000", "AffiliationID": "60023256", "AffiliationName": "Politecnico di Milano"}}}
