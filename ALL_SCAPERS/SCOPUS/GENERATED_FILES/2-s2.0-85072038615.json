Among the possible design limitations of CAR-T cells for cancer are unwanted tonic (antigen-independent) signaling and off-target activation. Efforts to overcome these hurdles have been blunted by a lack of mechanistic understanding. Here, we showed that single-cell analysis with time course mass cytometry provided a rapid means of assessing CAR-T cell activation. We compared signal transduction in expanded T cells to that in T cells transduced to express second-generation CARs and found that cell expansion enhanced the response to stimulation. However, expansion also induced tonic signaling and reduced network plasticity, which were associated with expression of the T cell exhaustion markers PD-1 and TIM-3. Because this was most evident in pathways downstream of CD3, we performed similar analyses on \u03b3\u221eT cells that expressed chimeric costimulatory receptors (CCRs) lacking CD3 but containing DAP10 stimulatory domains. These CCR-\u03b3\u221eT cells did not exhibit tonic signaling but were efficiently activated and mounted cytotoxic responses in the presence of CCR-specific stimuli or cognate leukemic cells. Single-cell signaling analysis enabled detailed characterization of CAR-T and CCR-T cell activation to better understand their functional activities. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CCR-\u03b3\u221eT cells may offer the potential to avoid on-target, off-tumor toxicity and allo-reactivity in the context of myeloid malignancies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["CD3 Complex", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cells, Cultured", "Cytotoxicity, Immunologic", "Genetic Engineering", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Immunotherapy, Adoptive", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Neoplasms", "Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta", "Receptors, Chimeric Antigen", "Signal Transduction", "T-Lymphocytes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072038615", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"56108105900": {"Name": "Fisher J.", "AuthorID": "56108105900", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Program for Computational and Systems Biology, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"}, "57210956709": {"Name": "Don D.W.", "AuthorID": "57210956709", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL/GOSH Institute of Child Health"}, "55883527700": {"Name": "Barisa M.", "AuthorID": "55883527700", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL/GOSH Institute of Child Health"}, "57210956825": {"Name": "Hurtado M.O.", "AuthorID": "57210956825", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL/GOSH Institute of Child Health"}, "56151198400": {"Name": "Abramowski P.", "AuthorID": "56151198400", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL/GOSH Institute of Child Health"}, "57210960666": {"Name": "Porter L.", "AuthorID": "57210960666", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL/GOSH Institute of Child Health"}, "57194058118": {"Name": "Borea R.", "AuthorID": "57194058118", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL/GOSH Institute of Child Health"}, "55731054400": {"Name": "Anderson J.", "AuthorID": "55731054400", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute"}, "57202604531": {"Name": "Sharma R.", "AuthorID": "57202604531", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics, Columbia University"}, "7801385757": {"Name": "Pe'er D.", "AuthorID": "7801385757", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"}, "57210960405": {"Name": "Day W.", "AuthorID": "57210960405", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute"}, "55641886800": {"Name": "Inglott S.", "AuthorID": "55641886800", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology and Oncology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}}}
