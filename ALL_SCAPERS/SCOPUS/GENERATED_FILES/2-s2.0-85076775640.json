Objectives: To investigate CSF neurogranin in parkinsonian disorders compared to controls and Alzheimer's disease and the possible correlations between neurogranin and cognitive and motor impairment. Methods: We included 157 patients with PD, 29 with PD with dementia, 11 with dementia with Lewy bodies, 26 with MSA, 21 with PSP, 6 with corticobasal syndrome, 47 controls, and 124 with Alzheimer's disease. CSF neurogranin was measured using two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays; from EUROIMMUN and the University of Gothenburg. Results: We found a strong correlation between CSF neurogranin-EI and CSF neurogranin\u2013University of Gothenburg (Rs = 0.890; P < 0.001). Neurogranin was decreased in PD, PD with dementia, MSA, and PSP compared to controls and Alzheimer's disease. Neurogranin did not correlate with motor or cognitive impairment, longitudinal decline, or progression to dementia in PD. Conclusions: CSF neurogranin is decreased in parkinsonian disorders compared to controls, emphasizing the importance of synaptic dysfunction in these disorders. \u00a9 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cerebrospinal fluid", "neurogranin", "parkinsonian disorders"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076775640", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56823785300": {"Name": "Hall S.", "AuthorID": "56823785300", "AffiliationID": "60014077", "AffiliationName": "Memory Clinic, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital"}, "57194936571": {"Name": "Janelidze S.", "AuthorID": "57194936571", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Sciences, Malm\u00f6, Lund University"}, "23005631700": {"Name": "Mattsson N.", "AuthorID": "23005631700", "AffiliationID": "60022932, 60029170", "AffiliationName": "Wallenberg Center for Molecular Medicine, Lund University"}, "55416685100": {"Name": "Surova Y.", "AuthorID": "55416685100", "AffiliationID": "60014077, 60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital, Lund University"}, "7006190615": {"Name": "Hansson O.", "AuthorID": "7006190615", "AffiliationID": "60014077", "AffiliationName": "Memory Clinic, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital"}, "57208899083": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "57208899083", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL"}, "7101909602": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "7101909602", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg"}, "37110582700": {"Name": "Brix B.", "AuthorID": "37110582700", "AffiliationID": "60112034", "AffiliationName": "EUROIMMUN AG"}}}
