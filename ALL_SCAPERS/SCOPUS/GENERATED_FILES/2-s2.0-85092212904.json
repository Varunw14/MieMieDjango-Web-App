Published by IOP Publishing Ltd on behalf of the Institute of Physics and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.Wavepacket tunneling, in the relativistic limit, is studied via solutions to the Dirac equation for a square barrier potential. Specifically, the arrival time distribution (the time-dependent flux) is computed for wavepackets initiated far away from the barrier, and whose momentum is well below the threshold for above-barrier transmission. The resulting distributions exhibit peaks at shorter times than those of photons with the same initial wavepacket transmitting through a vacuum. However, this apparent superluminality in time is accompanied by very low transmission probabilities. We discuss these observations, and related observations by other authors, in the context of published objections to the notion that tunneling can be superluminal in time. We find that many of these objections are not consistent with our observations, and conclude that post-selected (for transmission) distributions of arrival times can be superluminal. However, the low probability of tunneling means a photon will most likely be seen first and therefore the superluminality does not imply superluminal signaling.", "AuthorKeywords": ["momentumfiltering", "phase time", "superluminality", "time dependent Dirac equation", "tunneling time"], "IndexKeywords": ["Arrival-time distributions", "Barrier potential", "Barrier transmission", "Dirac equations", "Low probability", "Superluminal signaling", "Superluminality", "Transmission probabilities"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092212904", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"7004651541": {"Name": "Dumont R.S.", "AuthorID": "7004651541", "AffiliationID": "60031828", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, McMaster University"}, "56743096900": {"Name": "Rivlin T.", "AuthorID": "56743096900", "AffiliationID": "60017563", "AffiliationName": "Chemical and Biological Physics Department, Weizmann Institute of Science"}, "7103216041": {"Name": "Pollak E.", "AuthorID": "7103216041", "AffiliationID": "60017563", "AffiliationName": "Chemical and Biological Physics Department, Weizmann Institute of Science"}}}
