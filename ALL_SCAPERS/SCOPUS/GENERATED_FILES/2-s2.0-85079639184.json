Measurements carried out at room temperature, and a range of relative humidity values (RH) from 0 to 70%, reflected real-world conditions similar to those of indoor air. Dry removal performance appeared to be dependent on the surface area of adsorbents and, for polar compounds, the relative hydrophobicity of the material. Performance of sorbents with hydrophilic surface chemistry, such as silica gel and molecular sieve 13X, decreased drastically with small increases in pre-exposed humidity. Activated charcoal and high-silica faujasite Y retained their capacities for toluene in relative humidities up to 50% and 70% respectively, with their selectivity for non-polar species credited to hydrophobic pore structure and low water vapour uptake. These conclusions help to emphasise the importance of process humidity as a key parameter when designing or selecting adsorbents in realistic process conditions. Additionally, the methods used in this study provide a simple and reproducible way of testing porous materials for applications requiring or involving high levels of relative humidity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Competitive adsorption", "Hydrophobicity index", "Volatile organic compound", "Water vapour", "Zeolites"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079639184", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"]], "AuthorData": {"57214996057": {"Name": "Hunter-Sellars E.", "AuthorID": "57214996057", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "55574201884": {"Name": "Williams D.R.", "AuthorID": "55574201884", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "57215006411": {"Name": "Tee J.J.", "AuthorID": "57215006411", "AffiliationID": "60025856", "AffiliationName": "Procter & Gamble Co."}, "57213083930": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "57213083930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
