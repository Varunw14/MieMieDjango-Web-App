International Wound Journal published by Medicalhelplines.com Inc (3M) and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.This study evaluates the current clinical evidence of Negative Pressure Wound Therapy with Instillation and dwell time (NPWTi-d) to establish its clinical application and efficacy. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases were searched from 1946 to July 2019 for studies reporting clinical outcomes on wounds treated with NPWTi-d. The primary outcome was proportion of wounds with complete healing. The secondary outcomes were mean time for healing, NPWTi-d settings, cost, length of stay, and adverse events. Thirteen articles were included with a total of 624 wounds in 542 patients involving wounds of various aetiology. The pooled proportion of wound that achieved complete healing was 93.65% (95%CI: 84.02-99.04). Normal saline was the most commonly used instillation solution with the mean dwell time of 14.23 minutes (95%CI: 10.88-17.59) and instillation cycle every 4.17 \u00b1 2.32 hourly. The mean therapy duration was 10.69 days (95%CI: 10.46-10.91) with daily cost of $194.80. The mean hospital stay was 18.1 days (95%CI: 17.20-19.00). There were no severe adverse effects reported. NPWTi-d is an adjuntive therapy to aid complete healing of the vast majority of wounds. However, the current data are limited by the lack of level 1 evidence.", "AuthorKeywords": ["negative pressure wound therapy with instillation", "NPWTi-d", "Veraflo"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092091365", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"]], "AuthorData": {"56427994500": {"Name": "Kanapathy M.", "AuthorID": "56427994500", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust Hospital"}, "55985666400": {"Name": "Mosahebi A.", "AuthorID": "55985666400", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust Hospital"}, "19838662800": {"Name": "Younis I.", "AuthorID": "19838662800", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust Hospital"}, "57205184134": {"Name": "Mantelakis A.", "AuthorID": "57205184134", "AffiliationID": "60176725", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ear, Nose and Throat Surgery, Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust"}, "57219292950": {"Name": "Khan N.", "AuthorID": "57219292950", "AffiliationID": "60012558, 60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Charing Cross Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
