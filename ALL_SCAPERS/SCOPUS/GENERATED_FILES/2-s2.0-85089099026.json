It covers a spectrum of conditions resulting from excess lipid accumulation in the liver without alcohol abuse. Among all the risk factors, over-consumption of fructose has been repeatedly reported in both clinical and experimental studies to be highly associated with the development of NAFLD. However, studying in vivo systems is complicated, time consuming and expensive. A detailed kinetic model of fructose metabolism was constructed to investigate the metabolic mechanisms whereby fructose consumption can induce dyslipidaemia associated with NAFLD and to explore whether the pathological conditions can be reversed during the early stages of disease. The model contains biochemical components and reactions identified from the literature, including ~120 parameters, 25 variables, and 25 first order differential equations. Three scenarios were presented to demonstrate the behavior of the model. Scenario one predicts the acute effects of a change in carbohydrate input in lipid profiles. The results present progressive triglyceride accumulations in the liver and plasma for three diets. The rate of accumulation was greater in the fructose diet than that of the mixed or glucose only models. Scenario two explores the variability of metabolic reaction rate within the general population. Sensitivity analysis reveals that hepatic triglyceride concentration is most sensitive to the rate constant of pyruvate kinase and fructokinase. Scenario three tests the effect of one specific inhibitor that might be potentially administered. The simulations of fructokinase suppression provide a good model for potentially reversing simple steatosis induced by high fructose consumption, which can be corroborated by experimental studies. The predictions in these three scenarios suggest that the model is robust and it has sufficient detail to present the kinetic relationship between fructose and lipid in the liver.", "AuthorKeywords": ["computational modeling", "fructose metabolism", "NAFLD", "systems biology", "triglyceride"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biochemical components", "Detailed kinetic modeling", "Fatty liver disease", "First order differential equation", "Fructose metabolisms", "Metabolic mechanism", "Metabolic reactions", "Pathological conditions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089099026", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Histology", "MEDI", "2722"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"57218396518": {"Name": "Liao Y.", "AuthorID": "57218396518", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London"}, "7004224932": {"Name": "Bogle I.D.L.", "AuthorID": "7004224932", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Center for Process Systems Engineering, University College London"}, "57210528435": {"Name": "Davies N.A.", "AuthorID": "57210528435", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London"}}}
