However, fluorescent nanodiamonds also have attractive properties for in vitro biosensing, including brightness2, low cost3 and selective manipulation of their emission4. Nanoparticle-based biosensors are essential for the early detection of disease, but they often lack the required sensitivity. Here we investigate fluorescent nanodiamonds as an ultrasensitive label for in vitro diagnostics, using a microwave field to modulate emission intensity5 and frequency-domain analysis6 to separate the signal from background autofluorescence7, which typically limits sensitivity. Focusing on the widely used, low-cost lateral flow format as an exemplar, we achieve a detection limit of 8.2 \u00d7 10\u221219 molar for a biotin\u2013avidin model, 105 times more sensitive than that obtained using gold nanoparticles. Single-copy detection of HIV-1 RNA can be achieved with the addition of a 10-minute isothermal amplification step, and is further demonstrated using a clinical plasma sample with an extraction step. This ultrasensitive quantum diagnostics platform is applicable to numerous diagnostic test formats and diseases, and has the potential to transform early diagnosis of disease for the benefit of patients and populations.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096614562", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57195275473": {"Name": "Miller B.S.", "AuthorID": "57195275473", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "57202204369": {"Name": "Bezinge L.", "AuthorID": "57202204369", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "56311254000": {"Name": "Gliddon H.D.", "AuthorID": "56311254000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "57220036311": {"Name": "Huang D.", "AuthorID": "57220036311", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "57209181754": {"Name": "Dold G.", "AuthorID": "57209181754", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "36730986800": {"Name": "Gray E.R.", "AuthorID": "36730986800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "55613970800": {"Name": "Morton J.J.L.", "AuthorID": "55613970800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006090296": {"Name": "McKendry R.A.", "AuthorID": "7006090296", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "56727849500": {"Name": "Heaney J.", "AuthorID": "56727849500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Pathogens Diagnostic Unit, University College London Hospitals"}, "13310093900": {"Name": "Dobson P.J.", "AuthorID": "13310093900", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "The Queens College, University of Oxford"}, "16310245000": {"Name": "Nastouli E.", "AuthorID": "16310245000", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Virology, University College London Hospitals"}}}
