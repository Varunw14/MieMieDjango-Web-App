Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Language problems are a risk factor for externalizing problems, but the developmental path remains unclear. Emotional competence may mediate the relationship, especially when externalizing problems are reactive in nature, such as in Oppositional Deviant Disorder (ODD) and reactive aggression. We examined the development of reactive and proactive externalizing problems in children with (n = 98) and without (n = 156) Developmental Language Disorder (DLD; age: 8\u201316 years) over 18 months. Relationships with communicative risk factors (structural, pragmatic and emotion communication) and the mediating role of emotional competence (emotion recognition and anger dysregulation) were examined. Multi-level analyses showed that increasing emotion recognition and decreasing anger dysregulation were longitudinally related to decreasing ODD symptoms in both groups, whereas anger dysregulation was related to more reactive aggression in children with DLD alone. Pragmatic and emotion communication problems were related to more reactive externalizing problems, but these relationships were mediated by emotional competence, suggesting that problems in emotional competence explain the communication problems of children with DLD. Therefore, in addition to interventions for communication skills, there is a need to address the emotional competence of children with DLD, as this decreases the risk for reactive externalizing problems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adolescence", "Development", "DLD", "Emotion recognition", "Emotion regulation", "Proactive aggression", "Reactive aggression", "SLI"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Anger", "Child", "Child Behavior Disorders", "Emotions", "Female", "Humans", "Language Development Disorders", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089539703", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis", "ENVI", "2307"]], "AuthorData": {"57203396524": {"Name": "van den Bedem N.P.", "AuthorID": "57203396524", "AffiliationID": "60019816", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Psychology, Leiden University"}, "6603039339": {"Name": "Rieffe C.", "AuthorID": "6603039339", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Human Development, University College London"}, "7004429681": {"Name": "Dockrell J.E.", "AuthorID": "7004429681", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Human Development, University College London"}, "6701709677": {"Name": "van Alphen P.M.", "AuthorID": "6701709677", "AffiliationID": "60118611", "AffiliationName": "Royal Dutch Kentalis"}}}
