Mental health and social care staff have, until now, had no valid or reliable way of assessing their clients\u2019 social inclusion. The Social Inclusion Questionnaire User Experience (SInQUE) was developed to address this. It assesses five domains: social integration; productivity; consumption; access to services; and political engagement, in the year prior to first psychiatric admission (T1) and the year prior to interview (T2) from which a total score at each time point can be calculated. Aims: To establish the validity, reliability, and acceptability of the SInQUE in individuals with a broad range of psychiatric diagnoses receiving care from community mental health services and its utility for mental health staff. Method: Participants were 192 mental health service users with psychosis, personality disorder, or common mental disorder (e.g., depression, anxiety) who completed the SInQUE alongside other validated outcome measures. Test\u2013retest reliability was assessed in a sub-sample of 30 participants and inter-rater reliability was assessed in 11 participants. SInQUE ratings of 28 participants were compared with those of a sibling with no experience of mental illness to account for shared socio-cultural factors. Acceptability and utility of the tool were assessed using completion rates and focus groups with staff. Results: The SInQUE demonstrated acceptable convergent validity. The total score and the Social Integration domain score were strongly correlated with quality of life, both in the full sample and in the three diagnostic groups. Discriminant validity and test\u2013retest reliability were established across all domains, although the test\u2013retest reliability on scores for the Service Access and Political Engagement domains prior to first admission to hospital (T1) was lower than other domains. Inter-rater reliability was excellent for all domains at T1 and T2. Conclusions: The component of the SInQUE that assesses current social inclusion has good psychometric properties and can be recommended for use by mental health staff.", "AuthorKeywords": ["common mental disorder", "mental illness", "Personality disorder", "Psychometrics", "Psychosis", "Social inclusion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Community Mental Health Services", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Mental Health", "Mentally Ill Persons", "Middle Aged", "Psychometrics", "Quality of Life", "Reproducibility of Results", "Social Isolation", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079017304", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7006157989": {"Name": "Mezey G.", "AuthorID": "7006157989", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "SGUL"}, "35460110900": {"Name": "White S.", "AuthorID": "35460110900", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "SGUL"}, "23090615200": {"Name": "Harrison I.", "AuthorID": "23090615200", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "SGUL"}, "57195216941": {"Name": "Bousfield J.", "AuthorID": "57195216941", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "SGUL"}, "35311223300": {"Name": "Lloyd-Evans B.", "AuthorID": "35311223300", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "SGUL"}, "16444723900": {"Name": "Payne S.", "AuthorID": "16444723900", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "SGUL"}, "6602601081": {"Name": "Killaspy H.", "AuthorID": "6602601081", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "SGUL"}}}
