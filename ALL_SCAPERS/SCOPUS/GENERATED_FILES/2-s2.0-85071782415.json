The compounds showed activity in the range of 1.95\u2013125 \u00b5g/ml against M. tuberculosis but showed no activity against M. aurum, E. coli, and S. aureus, indicating selectivity towards slow-growing mycobacterial pathogens. The compounds exhibited very low to no cytotoxicity up to 500 \u00b5g/ml concentration against eukaryotic cell lines. The most potent molecule, 2l, showed a minimum inhibitory concentration of 1.95 \u00b5g/ml against M. tuberculosis H37Rv and a selectivity index of >250 against both the eukaryotic cell lines. Furthermore, 2l showed moderate inhibition of whole-cell mycobacterial drug-efflux pumps when compared to verapamil, a known potent inhibitor of efflux pumps. Thus, derivative 2l was identified as an antituberculosis hit molecule, which could be used to yield more potent lead molecules.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dihydropyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4(3H)-one", "efflux pump inhibition", "HT-SPOTi assay", "resazurin microtiter assay", "tuberculosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Antitubercular Agents", "Cell Survival", "Drug Design", "Escherichia coli", "Humans", "Mice", "Microbial Sensitivity Tests", "Molecular Structure", "Mycobacteriaceae", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Pyrimidines", "RAW 264.7 Cells", "Staphylococcus aureus", "Structure-Activity Relationship", "THP-1 Cells"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071782415", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"56672604300": {"Name": "Agre N.", "AuthorID": "56672604300", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, The Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "57204248455": {"Name": "Degani M.", "AuthorID": "57204248455", "AffiliationID": "60006361", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Technology, Institute of Chemical Technology"}, "35068102400": {"Name": "Gupta A.", "AuthorID": "35068102400", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, The Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "6701498589": {"Name": "Bhakta S.", "AuthorID": "6701498589", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, The Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "7202799851": {"Name": "Ray M.K.", "AuthorID": "7202799851", "AffiliationID": "60018517, 60033473", "AffiliationName": "Tuberculosis, Immunology, & Immunoassay Development Section, Radiation Medicine Centre (BARC), Tata Memorial Hospital"}}}
