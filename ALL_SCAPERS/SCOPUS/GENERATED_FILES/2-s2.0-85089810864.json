All rights reserved.Introduction:Inequalities in life expectancy and mortality by social deprivation in the general population of the United Kingdom are widening. For people with dementia, data on potential gradients in life expectancy and mortality by social deprivation are sparse. This study aimed to explore potential differentials in life expectancy and mortality in people with dementia according to social deprivation.Methods:Using The Health Improvement Network (THIN) primary care database, we included people with a diagnosis of dementia in the United Kingdom in 2000 to 2016 and obtained data on age at death and mortality. Comparisons were made according to social deprivation quintiles adjusting for age at diagnosis.Results:Among 166,268 people with dementia there were no differences in life expectancy and mortality in the most deprived compared with the least deprived. This pattern has been stable during the study period, as no increasing inequalities in life expectancy and mortality according to social deprivation were found.Discussion:Contrary to the general population, there were limited inequalities in life expectancy and mortality according to social deprivation for people with dementia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dementia", "family practice", "social deprivation", "social inequality", "United Kingdom"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089810864", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Gerontology", "NURS", "2909"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56763872500": {"Name": "Vestergaard A.H.S.", "AuthorID": "56763872500", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital"}, "57030759800": {"Name": "Johnsen S.P.", "AuthorID": "57030759800", "AffiliationID": "60022134", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Medicine, Danish Center for Clinical Health Services Research, Aalborg University"}, "23009891600": {"Name": "Petersen I.", "AuthorID": "23009891600", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, Ucl Medical School"}, "7005604974": {"Name": "Sampson E.L.", "AuthorID": "7005604974", "AffiliationID": "60031025", "AffiliationName": "Barnet Enfield and Haringey Mental Health Trust Liaison Team, North Middlesex University Hospital"}}}
