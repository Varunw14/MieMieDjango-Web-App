After summarizing the comparative credentials of the policy learning literature, the article outlines a framework of four learning modes, relating it to three approaches of causality: deterministic, probabilistic, and set-theoretic. It then builds on this to explore different approaches to causation and learning in relation to: policy change, political contexts, and, finally, the temporal and spatial dimensions of comparative policy analysis. The article concludes by showing how these challenges are addressed and suggesting implications for further research.", "AuthorKeywords": ["causal mechanisms", "causation", "comparative policy analysis", "policy change", "policy learning"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086870888", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Public Administration", "SOCI", "3321"]], "AuthorData": {"15925222700": {"Name": "Dunlop C.A.", "AuthorID": "15925222700", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Department of Politics, University of Exeter"}, "6701387604": {"Name": "Radaelli C.M.", "AuthorID": "6701387604", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Policy, Department of Political Science, University College London"}}}
