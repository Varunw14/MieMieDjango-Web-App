In the literature, rdts are commonly specified in terms of two relations: visibility, which accounts for the different views that a store may have, and arbitration, which states the logical order imposed on the operations executed over the store. Different flavours, e.g., operational, axiomatic and functional, have recently been proposed for the specification of rdts. In this work, we propose an algebraic characterisation of rdt specifications. We define categories of visibility relations and arbitrations, show the existence of relevant limits and colimits, and characterize rdt specifications as functors between such categories that preserve these additional structures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Functorial characterisation", "Replicated data type", "Specification"], "IndexKeywords": ["Additional structures", "Data store", "Functorial characterisation", "Functors", "Replicated data"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077447296", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"22733984100": {"Name": "Gadducci F.", "AuthorID": "22733984100", "AffiliationID": "60028868", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Informatica, Universit\u00e0 di Pisa"}, "10042207200": {"Name": "Melgratti H.", "AuthorID": "10042207200", "AffiliationID": "60004518, 60001563", "AffiliationName": "ICC-CONICET-UBA"}, "55317128400": {"Name": "Rold\u00e1n C.", "AuthorID": "55317128400", "AffiliationID": "60001563", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Computaci\u00f3n, Universidad de Buenos Aires"}, "55770025200": {"Name": "Sammartino M.", "AuthorID": "55770025200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
