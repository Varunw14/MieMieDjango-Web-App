The effect of dapagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease, with or without type 2 diabetes, is not known. METHODS We randomly assigned 4304 participants with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 25 to 75 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area and a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (with albumin measured in milligrams and creatinine measured in grams) of 200 to 5000 to receive dapagliflozin (10 mg once daily) or placebo. The primary outcome was a composite of a sustained decline in the estimated GFR of at least 50%, end-stage kidney disease, or death from renal or cardiovascular causes. RESULTS The independent data monitoring committee recommended stopping the trial because of efficacy. Over a median of 2.4 years, a primary outcome event occurred in 197 of 2152 participants (9.2%) in the dapagliflozin group and 312 of 2152 participants (14.5%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51 to 0.72; P<0.001; number needed to treat to prevent one primary outcome event, 19 [95% CI, 15 to 27]). The hazard ratio for the composite of a sustained decline in the estimated GFR of at least 50%, end-stage kidney disease, or death from renal causes was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.45 to 0.68; P<0.001), and the hazard ratio for the composite of death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for heart failure was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.55 to 0.92; P=0.009). Death occurred in 101 participants (4.7%) in the dapagliflozin group and 146 participants (6.8%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.88; P=0.004). The effects of dapagliflozin were similar in participants with type 2 diabetes and in those without type 2 diabetes. The known safety profile of dapagliflozin was confirmed. CONCLUSIONS Among patients with chronic kidney disease, regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes, the risk of a composite of a sustained decline in the estimated GFR of at least 50%, end-stage kidney disease, or death from renal or cardiovascular causes was significantly lower with dapagliflozin than with placebo.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Benzhydryl Compounds", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Diabetic Nephropathies", "Female", "Glomerular Filtration Rate", "Glucosides", "Humans", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Kidney Failure, Chronic", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Regression Analysis", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic", "Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092598310", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"26324845700": {"Name": "Heerspink H.J.L.", "AuthorID": "26324845700", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Groningen"}, "8730003700": {"Name": "Stef\u00e1nsson B.V.", "AuthorID": "8730003700", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Groningen"}, "20533642000": {"Name": "Correa-Rotter R.", "AuthorID": "20533642000", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Groningen"}, "7006693864": {"Name": "Chertow G.M.", "AuthorID": "7006693864", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Groningen"}, "7102116338": {"Name": "Greene T.", "AuthorID": "7102116338", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Groningen"}, "57208598546": {"Name": "Hou F.F.", "AuthorID": "57208598546", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Groningen"}, "57203734343": {"Name": "Mann J.F.E.", "AuthorID": "57203734343", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Groningen"}, "57212075816": {"Name": "McMurray J.J.V.", "AuthorID": "57212075816", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Groningen"}, "18437624600": {"Name": "Lindberg M.", "AuthorID": "18437624600", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Groningen"}, "7005170096": {"Name": "Rossing P.", "AuthorID": "7005170096", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Groningen"}, "57194704997": {"Name": "David Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m C.", "AuthorID": "57194704997", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Groningen"}, "35418717400": {"Name": "Toto R.D.", "AuthorID": "35418717400", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Groningen"}, "56578074300": {"Name": "Langkilde A.M.", "AuthorID": "56578074300", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Groningen"}, "57198363448": {"Name": "Wheeler D.C.", "AuthorID": "57198363448", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Groningen"}}}
