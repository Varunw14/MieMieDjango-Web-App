Ectopic lymphoid organs (ELOs), untypical lymphoid annexes, emerge during chronic inflammation and contribute to the physiopathology of chronic inflammatory disorders. This review discusses the pathophysiological role of ELOs in the progression of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs), including multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), atherosclerosis, and Sj\u00f6gren syndrome (SSj). The molecular pathways underlying the emergence of ELOs are of interest for the development of novel pharmacological approaches for the management of chronic inflammatory diseases.", "AuthorKeywords": ["chemokines", "chronic inflammation", "dendritic cells", "immune system", "lymphocytes", "tertiary lymphoid organs"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086920345", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"8243395900": {"Name": "Antonioli L.", "AuthorID": "8243395900", "AffiliationID": "60028868", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa"}, "8243395300": {"Name": "Fornai M.", "AuthorID": "8243395300", "AffiliationID": "60028868", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa"}, "57210724180": {"Name": "Masi S.", "AuthorID": "57210724180", "AffiliationID": "60028868", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa"}, "6602551320": {"Name": "Puxeddu I.", "AuthorID": "6602551320", "AffiliationID": "60028868", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa"}, "7004046998": {"Name": "Blandizzi C.", "AuthorID": "7004046998", "AffiliationID": "60028868", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa"}, "55675364500": {"Name": "Pellegrini C.", "AuthorID": "55675364500", "AffiliationID": "60028868", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Pisa"}}}
