Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) targeting the cerebellum is a noninvasive technique requiring minimal physical or cognitive input from the patient, and has been shown to induce positive swallow-related brain changes in physiological studies as measured by increased cortical excitability. Aim: To explore in patients with acute/sub-acute poststroke dysphagia: (1) the feasibility and immediate effect; and (2) the optimal dose for long-term benefit, of cerebellar rTMS in patients with dysphagia in acute/sub-acute stroke. Methods: Two double-blind sham-controlled randomized phase II trials. Participants will be recruited from stroke units in Nottingham and Greater Manchester. Dysphagia will be confirmed via baseline videofluoroscopy (VFS). Participants will be blinded to treatment and receive cerebellar rTMS or sham stimulation: (1) single treatment of (10Hz, 250 pulse) in 24 participants; (2) daily for 3 days, twice-daily for 5 days, or twice-daily sham treatment for 5 days, in 48 participants. Results: The severity of dysphagia will be assessed with VFS, using the penetration aspiration scale (PAS) at: (1) 1-hour, (2) 2-weeks, post-treatment. Additional comparative measures will be taken from: (1) pharyngeal motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes, (2) the functional oral intake score and dysphagia severity rating scale. Conclusions: If these studies demonstrate feasibility and identify optimal dosing, further trials to assess the safety and efficacy of cerebellar rTMS as a treatment for poststroke dysphagia will be warranted.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cerebellum", "dysphagia", "repetitive transcranial magnetic resonance stimulation", "Stroke"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cerebellum", "Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic", "Deglutition", "Deglutition Disorders", "Disability Evaluation", "Double-Blind Method", "England", "Humans", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Recovery of Function", "Stroke", "Stroke Rehabilitation", "Time Factors", "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077680269", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Rehabilitation", "MEDI", "2742"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57213192012": {"Name": "Wilkinson G.", "AuthorID": "57213192012", "AffiliationID": "60025016", "AffiliationName": "Stroke, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "24723490800": {"Name": "Bath P.M.", "AuthorID": "24723490800", "AffiliationID": "60025016", "AffiliationName": "Stroke, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "50362050800": {"Name": "Sasegbon A.", "AuthorID": "50362050800", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60008873", "AffiliationName": "Gastrointestinal (GI) Sciences, Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Gastroenterology, School of Medical Sciences, University of Manchester, Salford Royal Hospital (part of the Manchester Academic Health Sciences Centre (MAHSC))"}, "7004104000": {"Name": "Hamdy S.", "AuthorID": "7004104000", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60008873", "AffiliationName": "Gastrointestinal (GI) Sciences, Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Gastroenterology, School of Medical Sciences, University of Manchester, Salford Royal Hospital (part of the Manchester Academic Health Sciences Centre (MAHSC))"}, "7501653486": {"Name": "Smith C.J.", "AuthorID": "7501653486", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60008873, 60111801", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Centre for Clinical Neurosciences, Division of Cardiovascular Sciences, University of Manchester, Salford Royal Hospital, Manchester Academic Health Sciences Centre (MAHSC)"}, "57216069345": {"Name": "Rothwell J.", "AuthorID": "57216069345", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, University College London"}}}
