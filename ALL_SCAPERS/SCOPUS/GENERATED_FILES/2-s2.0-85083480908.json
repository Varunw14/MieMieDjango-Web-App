Self-management in the context of multimorbidity is particularly challenging, placing patients at risk of poor clinical outcomes. This study aimed to explore the prognostic associations between health literacy domains, depression, and 12-month health care utilization and mortality in patients with diabetes and end-stage renal disease (DM-ESRD). Design Observational study. Methods Patients with DM-ESRD undergoing haemodialysis were recruited. Information on all-cause hospitalization/admission and mortality of participants was recorded. Negative binomial and Cox regressions were used to model risk factors for hospitalization and mortality. Results A total 221 participants [median age: 59 years, 61.6% men, 54.8% Chinese] were recruited. Differences in health literacy were found as a function of age, ethnicity, relationship status, and education. After adjusting for demographic and clinical factors, the HLQ domain Actively Managing My Health remained independently associated with lower rates of hospitalization (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 0.674, 95% CI [0.490, 0.925], p =.02) and mortality (hazard ratio = 0.382, 95% CI [0.160, 0.848], p =.02). Cumulative hospitalization days were associated with employment status (IRR = 2.242, 95% CI [1.223, 4.113], p =.009), albumin (IRR = 0.918, 95% CI [0.854, 0.988], p =.02), HbA1c (IRR = 1.183, 95% CI [1.028, 1.360], p =.02), comorbidity burden (IRR = 1.137, 95% CI [1.003, 1.289], p =.04), and depression (IRR = 1.059, 95% CI [1.003, 1.118], p =.04) but no health literacy domains. Conclusions Health literacy skills related to Actively Managing My Health predict hospitalization and mortality independently of other risk factors. The HLQ provides an assessement of novel health literacy parameters which offer new insights into patients\u2019 status and behaviours and may strengthen interventions to improve clinical services, and patient outcomes in DM-ESRD. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Patients with diabetes (DM) comprise the fastest growing segment of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Health literacy (HL) is pivotal for managing the complex treatment guidelines for DM-ESRD. Most prior work on HL focused on functional HL and shown significant associations with mortality and hospitalization. Limited research has investigated wider HL skills in relation to clinical outcomes. What does this study add? Supporting patients in Actively Managing my health liteacy skills is critical in decreasing probability of hospitalization and morbidity. The presence of symptoms of depression is associated with longer hospitalization period.", "AuthorKeywords": ["diabetes", "end-stage renal disease", "health literacy", "Health Literacy Questionnaire", "hospitalization", "mortality"], "IndexKeywords": ["Diabetes Complications", "Diabetes Mellitus", "Female", "Health Literacy", "Humans", "Kidney Failure, Chronic", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Patients", "Prospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083480908", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"]], "AuthorData": {"6602428057": {"Name": "Griva K.", "AuthorID": "6602428057", "AffiliationID": "60005510, 60118633", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Population Health Sciences, Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Imperial College and Nanyang Technological University"}, "56671310100": {"Name": "Yoong R.K.L.", "AuthorID": "56671310100", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, National University of Singapore"}, "56530070700": {"Name": "Lee V.Y.W.", "AuthorID": "56530070700", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, National University of Singapore"}, "56023243200": {"Name": "Kang A.W.C.", "AuthorID": "56023243200", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, National University of Singapore"}, "7004146696": {"Name": "Nandakumar M.", "AuthorID": "7004146696", "AffiliationID": "100798756", "AffiliationName": "National Kidney Foundation Singapore"}, "57205310567": {"Name": "Rajeswari M.", "AuthorID": "57205310567", "AffiliationID": "100798756", "AffiliationName": "National Kidney Foundation Singapore"}, "26654817200": {"Name": "Khoo E.Y.H.", "AuthorID": "26654817200", "AffiliationID": "60106366", "AffiliationName": "Division of Endocrinology, University Medicine Cluster, National University Health System"}, "7101890122": {"Name": "Osborne R.H.", "AuthorID": "7101890122", "AffiliationID": "60030804", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Global Health and Equity Faculty of Health, Arts and Design, Swinburne University of Technology"}, "57189223748": {"Name": "Brini S.", "AuthorID": "57189223748", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "City University, University of London"}, "55808072084": {"Name": "Newman S.P.", "AuthorID": "55808072084", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "City University, University of London"}}}
