Niobium pentoxide was the first material described as exhibiting intercalation pseudocapacitance. The electrochemical kinetics for charging/discharging this material are surface-limited for a wide range of conditions despite intercalation via diffusion. Investigations of niobium pentoxide nanostructures are diverse and numerous; however, none have yet compared performance while adjusting a single architectural parameter at a time. Such a comparative approach reduces the reliance on models and the associated assumptions when seeking nanostructure\u2013property relationships. Here, a tailored isomorphic series of niobium pentoxide nanostructures with constant pore size and precision tailored wall thickness is examined. The sweep rate at which niobium pentoxide transitions from being surface-limited to being diffusion-limited is shown to depend sensitively upon the nanoscale dimensions of the niobium pentoxide architecture. Subsequent experiments probing the independent effects of electrolyte concentration and film thickness unambiguously identify solid-state lithium diffusion as the dominant diffusion constraint even in samples with just 48.5\u201367.0 nm thick walls. The resulting architectural dependencies from this type of investigation are critical to enable energy-dense nanostructures that are tailored to deliver a specific power density.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cyclic voltammetry", "kinetic control", "Li + intercalation", "pseudocapacitance", "soft templating"], "IndexKeywords": ["Architectural parameters", "Charging/discharging", "Comparative approach", "Diffusion constraints", "Electrochemical kinetics", "Electrolyte concentration", "Intercalation materials", "Nanoscale dimensions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094662982", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57208017936": {"Name": "van den Bergh W.", "AuthorID": "57208017936", "AffiliationID": "60018179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of South Carolina"}, "57188651013": {"Name": "Lokupitiya H.N.", "AuthorID": "57188651013", "AffiliationID": "60013340", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, College of Charleston"}, "57219664649": {"Name": "Vest N.A.", "AuthorID": "57219664649", "AffiliationID": "60018179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of South Carolina"}, "26533431100": {"Name": "Stefik M.", "AuthorID": "26533431100", "AffiliationID": "60018179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of South Carolina"}, "56742795500": {"Name": "Reid B.", "AuthorID": "56742795500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "25927105300": {"Name": "Guldin S.", "AuthorID": "25927105300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
