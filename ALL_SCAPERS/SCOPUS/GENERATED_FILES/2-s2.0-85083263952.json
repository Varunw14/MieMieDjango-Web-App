In England, these services are called sexual assault referral centres (SARCs). Mental health and substance misuse problems are common among SARC attendees, but little is known about how SARCs should address these needs. This review aims to seek and synthesise evidence regarding approaches to identification and support for mental health and substance misuse problems in SARCs and corresponding services internationally; empirical evidence regarding effective service models; and stakeholders' views and policy recommendations about optimal SARC practice. Methods A systematic review was undertaken. PsycINFO, MEDLINE, IBSS and CINAHL were searched from 1975 to August 2018. A web-based search up to December 2018 was also conducted to identify government and expert guidelines on SARCs. Quality assessment and narrative synthesis were conducted. Results We included 107 papers. We found that identification based on clinical judgement, supportive counselling and referral to other services without active follow-up were the most common approaches. Evaluations of interventions for post-rape psychopathology in attendees of sexual assault services provided mixed evidence of moderate quality. Very little evidence was found regarding interventions or support for substance misuse. Stakeholders emphasised the importance of accessibility, flexibility, continuity of care, in-house psychological support, staff trained in mental health as well as specialist support for LGBT groups and people with learning difficulties. Guidelines suggested that SARCs should assess for mental health and substance misuse and provide in-house emotional support, but the extent and nature of support were not clarified. Both stakeholders and guidelines recommended close partnership between sexual assault services and local counselling services. Conclusions This review suggests that there is big variation in the mental health and substance misuse provision both across and within different sexual assault service models. We found no robust evidence about how sexual assault services can achieve good mental health and substance misuse outcomes for service users. Clearer guidance for service planners and commissioners, informed by robust evidence about optimal service organisations and pathways, is required.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Female", "Government", "Guidelines as Topic", "Health Planning Guidelines", "Health Resources", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Health", "Sex Offenses", "Substance-Related Disorders", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083263952", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57210637025": {"Name": "Stefanidou T.", "AuthorID": "57210637025", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "57216341536": {"Name": "Kester K.", "AuthorID": "57216341536", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "35311223300": {"Name": "Lloyd-Evans B.", "AuthorID": "35311223300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "57208306621": {"Name": "Hughes E.", "AuthorID": "57208306621", "AffiliationID": "60012070, 60163612", "AffiliationName": "School of Healthcare, Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of Leeds"}, "55745402700": {"Name": "Majeed-Ariss R.", "AuthorID": "55745402700", "AffiliationID": "60012070, 60163612", "AffiliationName": "School of Healthcare, Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of Leeds"}, "37120521300": {"Name": "Kendal S.", "AuthorID": "37120521300", "AffiliationID": "60012070, 60163612", "AffiliationName": "School of Healthcare, Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of Leeds"}, "37052739000": {"Name": "Shallcross R.", "AuthorID": "37052739000", "AffiliationID": "60012070, 60163612", "AffiliationName": "School of Healthcare, Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of Leeds"}, "56020736300": {"Name": "Edmondson A.", "AuthorID": "56020736300", "AffiliationID": "60032343", "AffiliationName": "School of Human and Health Sciences, University of Huddersfield"}, "57212283219": {"Name": "Smith C.", "AuthorID": "57212283219", "AffiliationID": "60032343", "AffiliationName": "School of Human and Health Sciences, University of Huddersfield"}, "9278896300": {"Name": "Lucock M.", "AuthorID": "9278896300", "AffiliationID": "60032343", "AffiliationName": "School of Human and Health Sciences, University of Huddersfield"}, "24553753900": {"Name": "Ariss S.", "AuthorID": "24553753900", "AffiliationID": "60008750, 60001881, 60176589", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Assistive Technology and Connected Healthcare (CATCH), School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR), University of Sheffield"}, "57204025331": {"Name": "Brooker C.", "AuthorID": "57204025331", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Criminology and Sociology, Royal Holloway University of London"}, "56249879600": {"Name": "Gilchrist G.", "AuthorID": "56249879600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Section of Women's Mental Health, Health Service, Population Research Department, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "57217839920": {"Name": "Perot C.", "AuthorID": "57217839920", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Medical School: Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "36093631800": {"Name": "Trevillion K.", "AuthorID": "36093631800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Section of Women's Mental Health, Health Service, Population Research Department, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "57212621371": {"Name": "Maxted F.", "AuthorID": "57212621371", "AffiliationID": "114543102", "AffiliationName": "Survivors Trust, Rugby"}}}
