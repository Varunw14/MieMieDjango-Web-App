Recently, numerous governments have been caught up in a major bribery scandal operated by a major Brazilian building company. Bogot\u00e1, the capital of Colombia, is interesting because, in the 1990s and early 2000s, it introduced new processes aimed at preventing corruption in the allocation of public contracts. These processes clearly failed because, between 2008 and 2010, the city\u2019s mayor offered major contracts to some extremely dubious companies. Unusually for Latin America, the guilty mayor has been jailed, along with numerous local Councillors and the contractors. This paper explains how attempts to prevent corruption failed and what steps have been taken since to prevent it happening again. Bogot\u00e1\u2019s experience is important because it is one of the best-run cities in Latin America and, if it cannot control corruption, few cities in the region will manage to either.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Colombia", "Corruption", "Infrastructure", "Latin America", "Odebrecht", "politics", "public contracts", "Transmilenio"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074730050", "SubjectAreas": [["History", "ARTS", "1202"]], "AuthorData": {"7201514890": {"Name": "Gilbert A.", "AuthorID": "7201514890", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Emeritus Professor of Geography, University College London"}}}
