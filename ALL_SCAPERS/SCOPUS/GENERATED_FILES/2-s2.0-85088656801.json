Anticoagulant-refractory thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome can be broadly defined as breakthrough thrombosis while on standard oral anticoagulation treatment and its management is a major challenge given the serious nature of the thrombotic disease observed, which has become refractory to oral anticoagulation. The factors (genetic and cellular) that cause anticoagulant-refractory thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome are now better understood. However, efforts to use this greater understanding have not yet transformed the capacity to treat it successfully in many patients. In this Viewpoint, we review the factors that are likely to be contributing to the cause of this syndrome and consider how they might be modified or inhibited. We also discuss management, including general strategies to minimise thrombotic risk, intensification of anticoagulation, addition of an antiplatelet agent, adjunctive treatment for thrombosis, immunomodulatory therapy, complement inhibition, vascular options, and future potential therapeutic targets.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anticoagulants", "Antiphospholipid Syndrome", "Drug Resistance", "Fibrinolytic Agents", "Humans", "Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors", "Thrombolytic Therapy", "Thrombosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088656801", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"7402809618": {"Name": "Cohen H.", "AuthorID": "7402809618", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Haemostasis Research Unit, Department of Haematology, University College London"}, "57203210345": {"Name": "Sayar Z.", "AuthorID": "57203210345", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57201108555": {"Name": "Isenberg D.", "AuthorID": "57201108555", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "24279560200": {"Name": "Efthymiou M.", "AuthorID": "24279560200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Haemostasis Research Unit, Department of Haematology, University College London"}, "57217330003": {"Name": "Gaspar P.", "AuthorID": "57217330003", "AffiliationID": "60021007", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital of Santa Maria"}, "57217792667": {"Name": "Richards T.", "AuthorID": "57217792667", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "Department of Vascular Surgery, University of Western Australia"}}}
