In order to promote its electrochemical performances, Li6.4La3Al0.2Zr2O12 (LLAZO) with the intrinsic property of fast ion conductivity has been employed as a protective layer to modify surface of LNMO. By regulating the LLAZO contents, 1 wt % LLAZO coated LNMO (LLAZO-1) cathode shows a high capacity of 92.1 mAh g\u22121 over 600 cycles with a capacity retention of 72.6% at 1 C and a reversible capacity of 57.9 mAh g\u22121 at 20 C, much higher than those of pristine LNMO. Further investigation indicates that the greatly improved electrochemical performances of LLAZO-1 can be attributed to the LLAZO modification, which including the LLAZO surface coating and La3+ and Zr4+ gradient co-doping. In addition, the LLAZO precursor significantly restricts the growth of LNMO precursor particles during calcination process, shorting Li+ migration pathway. Thus, modification strategy effectively improves the structure stability of LNMO, accompanied with the enhancement in lithium-ion diffusion kinetics performances and confinement in particle growth. This optimization approach with tri-functions sheds light on novel electrode design and construction in rechargeable batteries.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Li6.4La3Al0.2Zr2O12", "LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4", "Lithium-ion batteries", "Tri-functional modification"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electrochemical performance", "Functional modification", "Li6.4La3Al0.2Zr2O12", "LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4", "Lithium ion diffusion", "Optimization approach", "Precursor particles", "Reversible capacity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078787027", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57208679652": {"Name": "Li L.", "AuthorID": "57208679652", "AffiliationID": "60003146", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics & Electronics, Henan University"}, "57208856573": {"Name": "Zhao R.", "AuthorID": "57208856573", "AffiliationID": "60003146", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics & Electronics, Henan University"}, "56520878800": {"Name": "Pan D.", "AuthorID": "56520878800", "AffiliationID": "60003146", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics & Electronics, Henan University"}, "57204054724": {"Name": "Yi S.", "AuthorID": "57204054724", "AffiliationID": "60003146", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics & Electronics, Henan University"}, "57196223386": {"Name": "Gao L.", "AuthorID": "57196223386", "AffiliationID": "60003146", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics & Electronics, Henan University"}, "7404778018": {"Name": "Zhao H.", "AuthorID": "7404778018", "AffiliationID": "60003146", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics & Electronics, Henan University"}, "56050510800": {"Name": "Yu C.", "AuthorID": "56050510800", "AffiliationID": "60003146", "AffiliationName": "National Demonstration Center for Experimental Physics and Electronics Education, School of Physics and Electronics, Henan University"}, "56640359500": {"Name": "Bai Y.", "AuthorID": "56640359500", "AffiliationID": "60003146", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics & Electronics, Henan University"}, "55626024600": {"Name": "He G.", "AuthorID": "55626024600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Research Centre, UCL Department of Chemistry"}}}
