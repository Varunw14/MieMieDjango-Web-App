Deviations from a straight profile for pipelines may be introduced by the pipe-laying vessel\u2019s sway motion during the installation process. In this study, analytical solutions of lateral buckling are deduced for imperfect unburied subsea pipelines with a distributed buoyancy section. The effect of initial imperfections on buckled configurations and typical post-buckling behaviours is illustrated and analysed. The results show that, compared to the case without initial imperfection, lateral displacement amplitude becomes larger when initial imperfection exists. Maximum compressive stress increases when wavelength of initial imperfection is smaller than buckled length of pipeline. However, maximum compressive stress decreases when wavelength of initial imperfection is larger than buckled length of pipeline. So it\u2019s better to introduce longer wavelength of initial imperfection.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Analytical studies", "High temperature and high pressure", "Initial imperfection", "Lateral buckling", "Lateral displacements", "Pipe-laying vessel", "Postbuckling", "Sub-sea pipelines"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075824029", "SubjectAreas": [["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"56159250900": {"Name": "Wang Z.", "AuthorID": "56159250900", "AffiliationID": "60019533", "AffiliationName": "Tianjin University"}, "7404592156": {"Name": "Tang Y.", "AuthorID": "7404592156", "AffiliationID": "60019533", "AffiliationName": "Tianjin University"}, "7005973659": {"Name": "Van der Heijden G.", "AuthorID": "7005973659", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
