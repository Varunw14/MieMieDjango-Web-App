The SI at FD relay is not necessarily canceled as much as possible like the conventional approaches, but is canceled or utilized based on a signal-to-residual-SI ratio (SRSIR) threshold at relay. According to the selected SI processing mode at relay, an ICA-based adaptive semi-blind scheme is proposed for signal separation and detection at destination. The proposed FD relay system not only features reduced signal processing cost of SI cancelation but also achieves a much higher degree of freedom in signal detection. The resulting bit error rate (BER) performance is robust against a wide range of SRSIR, much better than that of conventional FD systems, and close to the ideal case with perfect channel state information (CSI) and perfect SI cancelation. The proposed system also requires negligible spectral overhead as only a nonredundant precoding is needed for ambiguity elimination in ICA. In addition, the proposed system enables full resource utilization with consecutive data transmission at all time and same frequency, leading to much higher throughput and energy efficiency than the time-splitting and power-splitting-based self-energy recycling approaches that utilize only partial resources. Furthermore, an intensive analysis is provided, where the SRSIR thresholds for the adaptive SI processing mode selection and the BER expressions with ICA incurred ambiguities are derived.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Full-duplex (FD) relay", "independent component analysis (ICA)", "low-latency and high-reliability (LLHR) Internet of Things (IoT)", "self-interference (SI)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amplifyand-forward relay", "Bit error rate (BER) performance", "Full-duplex", "High reliability", "Independent component analysis(ICA)", "Internet of Things (IOT)", "Perfect channel state information", "Self-interferences"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082124825", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"57211668438": {"Name": "Duan H.", "AuthorID": "57211668438", "AffiliationID": "60019616", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology"}, "55574545800": {"Name": "Jiang Y.", "AuthorID": "55574545800", "AffiliationID": "60019616", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology"}, "57208802684": {"Name": "Zhu X.", "AuthorID": "57208802684", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, University of Liverpool"}, "57158079100": {"Name": "Wei Z.", "AuthorID": "57158079100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College London"}, "57201965254": {"Name": "Sun S.", "AuthorID": "57201965254", "AffiliationID": "60002668, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Department of Communications and Networks, Agency for Science Technology and Research, Institute for Infocomm Research"}}}
