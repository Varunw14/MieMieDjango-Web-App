Physiological Reports published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of The Physiological Society and the American Physiological Society.Background: Anemia is common in liver cirrhosis. This generally infers a fall in total hemoglobin mass (tHb-mass). However, hemoglobin concentration ([Hb]) may fall due to an expansion in plasma volume (PV). The \u201coptimized carbon monoxide rebreathing method\u201d (oCOR) measures tHb-mass directly and PV (indirectly using hematocrit). It relies upon carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) distribution throughout the entire circulation. In healthy subjects, such distribution is complete within 6\u20138 min. Given the altered circulatory dynamics in cirrhosis, we sought in this pilot study, to assess whether this was true in cirrhosis. The primary aim was to ascertain if the standard timings for the oCOR were applicable to patients with chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. The secondary aim was to explore the applicability of standard CO dosing methodologies to this patient population. Methods: Sixteen patients with chronic liver parenchymal disease were studied. However, tHb-mass was determined using the standard oCOR technique before elective paracentesis. Three subjects had an inadequate COHb% rise. In the remaining 13 (11 male), mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) age was 52 \u00b1 13.8 years, body mass 79.1 \u00b1 11.4 kg, height 175 \u00b1 6.8 cm. To these, mean \u00b1 SD dose of carbon monoxide (CO) gas administered was 0.73 \u00b1 0.13 ml/kg COHb values at baseline, 6 and 8 min (and \u201c7-min value\u201d) were compared to those at 10, 12, 15 and 20 min after CO rebreathing. Results: The \u201c7-min value\u201d for median COHb% (IQR) of 6.30% (6.21%\u20137.47%) did not differ significantly from those at subsequent time points (8 min: 6.30% (6.21%\u20137.47%), 10 min: 6.33% (6.00%\u20137.50%), 12 min: 6.33% (5.90%\u20137.40%), 15 min: 6.37% (5.80%\u20137.33%), 20 min: 6.27% (5.70%\u20137.20%)). Mean difference in calculated tHb-mass between minute 7 and minute 20 was only 4.1 g, or 0.6%, p =.68. No subjects reported any adverse effects. Conclusions: The oCOR method can be safely used to measure tHb-mass in patients with chronic liver disease and ascites, without adjustment of blood sample timings. Further work might refine and validate appropriate dosing regimens.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anemia", "chronic liver disease", "optimized carbon monoxide rebreathing method (oCOR)", "total hemoglobin mass (tHb-mass)"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082380690", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"57197297840": {"Name": "Plumb J.O.M.", "AuthorID": "57197297840", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Shackleton Department of Anaesthesia, University Hospital Southampton NHSFT"}, "56427610200": {"Name": "Otto J.M.", "AuthorID": "56427610200", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "University of Southampton Medical School"}, "55348894800": {"Name": "Grocott M.P.W.", "AuthorID": "55348894800", "AffiliationID": "60005200", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesiology, Duke University School of Medicine"}, "57195721182": {"Name": "Kumar S.B.", "AuthorID": "57195721182", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "University of Southampton Medical School"}, "9532830200": {"Name": "Wright M.", "AuthorID": "9532830200", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatology, University Hospital Southampton"}, "57210548821": {"Name": "Schmidt W.", "AuthorID": "57210548821", "AffiliationID": "60023208", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sports Medicine/Sports Physiology, University of Bayreuth"}, "35482685300": {"Name": "Montgomery H.E.", "AuthorID": "35482685300", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Human Health and Performance/ Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health, University College London, and NIHR University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre"}}}
