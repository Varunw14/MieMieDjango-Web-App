All rights reserved.Background: Several studies have investigated a possible association between respiratory infection and acute myocardial infarction (MI). As both influenza and pneumococcal infections are vaccine preventable, understanding the populations affected by virus-induced cardiovascular complications is important to guide public health and clinical practice. Aim: This observational study aimed to quantify the association between laboratory-confirmed respiratory bacteria or virus infections and risk of first MI or stroke, by using self-controlled case series (SCCS) analysis of anonymised linked electronic Danish health records. Methods: The SCCS method was used to determine the relative incidence of the first event of MI and stroke occurring within 28days after laboratory-confirmed respiratory infections compared with the baseline time period. Results: In the age and season adjusted analyses for first acute MI, the incidence ratios (IR) of a MI event occurring during the risk period were significantly elevated following a Streptococcus pneumoniae infection with values of 20.1, 11.0 and 4.9 during 1-3, 4-7 and 8-14days, respectively and following respiratory virus infection with values of 15.2, 4.5 and 4.4 during 1-3, 8-14 and 15-28days, respectively. The significantly elevated IRs for stroke following an S. pneumoniae infection were 25.5 and 6.3 during 1-3 and 8-14days, respectively and following respiratory virus infection 8.3, 7.8 and 6.2 during 1-3, 4-7 and 8-14days, respectively. Conclusion: This study suggested a significant cardiovascular event triggering effect following infection with S. pneumoniae and respiratory viruses (mainly influenza), indicating the importance of protection against vaccine-preventable respiratory infections.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Denmark", "Female", "Humans", "Incidence", "Influenza, Human", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Myocardial Infarction", "Pneumococcal Infections", "Respiratory Tract Infections", "Stroke"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084328376", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"57216701866": {"Name": "Ohland J.", "AuthorID": "57216701866", "AffiliationID": "60025543", "AffiliationName": "Statens Serum Institut"}, "55232729700": {"Name": "M\u00f8lbak K.", "AuthorID": "55232729700", "AffiliationID": "60013332, 60030840", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"}, "57200959179": {"Name": "Valentiner-Branth P.", "AuthorID": "57200959179", "AffiliationID": "60025543", "AffiliationName": "Statens Serum Institut"}, "36017244600": {"Name": "Nielsen J.", "AuthorID": "36017244600", "AffiliationID": "60025543", "AffiliationName": "Statens Serum Institut"}, "6602420961": {"Name": "Emborg H.D.", "AuthorID": "6602420961", "AffiliationID": "60025543", "AffiliationName": "Statens Serum Institut"}, "23471079400": {"Name": "Warren-Gash C.", "AuthorID": "23471079400", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "35067740700": {"Name": "Blackburn R.", "AuthorID": "35067740700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}}}
