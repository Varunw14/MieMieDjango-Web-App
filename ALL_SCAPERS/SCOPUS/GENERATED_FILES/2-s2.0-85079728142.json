Herein, we design a freestanding graphene laminate film electrode with highly efficient pore utilization for compact capacitive energy storage. The interlayer spacing of this film can be precisely adjusted, which enables a tunable porosity. By systematically tailoring the pore size for the electrolyte ions, pores are utilized optimally and thereby the volumetric capacitance is maximized. Consequently, the fabricated supercapacitor delivers a stack volumetric energy density of 88.1 Wh l\u22121 in an ionic liquid electrolyte, representing a critical breakthrough for optimizing the porosity towards compact energy storage. Moreover, the optimized film electrode is assembled into an ionogel-based, all-solid-state, flexible smart device with multiple optional outputs and superior stability, demonstrating enormous potential as a portable power supply in practical applications.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Capacitive energy storage", "Film electrodes", "Interlayer spacings", "Ionic liquid electrolytes", "Miniaturized electronics", "Portable power supplies", "Volumetric capacitance", "Volumetric energy densities"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079728142", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"]], "AuthorData": {"57196047611": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "57196047611", "AffiliationID": "60020745, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Shenyang National Laboratory for Materials Science, Institute of Metal Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "57198560184": {"Name": "Guo Z.", "AuthorID": "57198560184", "AffiliationID": "60114494, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "HKU Zhejiang Institute of Research and Innovation, The University of Hong Kong"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57200292014": {"Name": "Li H.", "AuthorID": "57200292014", "AffiliationID": "123505400", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China"}, "57198721416": {"Name": "Li F.", "AuthorID": "57198721416", "AffiliationID": "123505400", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China"}, "36664352000": {"Name": "Gadipelli S.", "AuthorID": "36664352000", "AffiliationID": "60016521", "AffiliationName": "College of Physics, Sichuan University"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.J.L.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.R.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7202774632": {"Name": "Howard C.A.", "AuthorID": "7202774632", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics & Astronomy, University College London"}}}
