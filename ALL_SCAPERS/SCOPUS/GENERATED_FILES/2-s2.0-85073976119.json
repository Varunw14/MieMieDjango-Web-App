This work aims to describe a minimally invasive approach with intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to remove a large sellar/parasellar synchronous tumor, and presents a systematic literature review. Methods: The preoperative MRI of a 54-year-old woman revealed a sellar lesion (28 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 16 mm), presumably a pituitary macroadenoma, and a second extra-axial lesion (22 \u00d7 36 \u00d7 20 mm) expanding from the tuberculum sellae to the planum sphenoidale with encasement of the anterior communicating complex, presumably a meningioma. We used intraoperative MRI to assess the extent of the resection before reconstructing the large skull base defect. Furthermore, we systematically reviewed pertinent articles retrieved by a PubMed/Embase database search between 1961 and December 2018. Results: Out of 63 patients with synchronous tumors reported in 43 publications, we found 3 patients in which the tumor was removed by EEA. In these 3 patients and the presented case, the resection of both lesions was successful, without major approach-related morbidity or mortality. More extensive removal of endonasal structures to gain an adequate tumor exposure was not necessary. We did not find any previous reports describing the benefits of intraoperative MRI in the presented setting. Conclusions: In the rare case of a synchronous meningioma and pituitary adenoma of the sellar region, intraoperative MRI might be beneficial in confirming residual disease before skull base reconstruction, and therefore radiologic follow-up.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery", "Intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging", "Pituitary adenoma", "Sella", "Synchronous tumor", "Tuberculum sellae meningioma"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adenoma", "Female", "Humans", "Meningeal Neoplasms", "Meningioma", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasms, Multiple Primary", "Neuroendoscopy", "Pituitary Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073976119", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57192655924": {"Name": "Roethlisberger M.", "AuthorID": "57192655924", "AffiliationID": "60029157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, University Malaya Specialist Centre, University of Malaya"}, "26640217100": {"Name": "Brand Y.", "AuthorID": "26640217100", "AffiliationID": "60023561", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oto-Rhino-Lanryngology, Cantonal Hospital Graubuenden"}, "57202592835": {"Name": "Mariani L.", "AuthorID": "57202592835", "AffiliationID": "60028287, 60023588", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital Basel, University of Basel"}, "57205643085": {"Name": "Jayapalan R.R.", "AuthorID": "57205643085", "AffiliationID": "60029157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, University Malaya Specialist Centre, University of Malaya"}, "6508126723": {"Name": "Waran V.", "AuthorID": "6508126723", "AffiliationID": "60029157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, University Malaya Specialist Centre, University of Malaya"}, "57211441499": {"Name": "Bin Abd Kadir K.A.", "AuthorID": "57211441499", "AffiliationID": "60029157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Imaging, University Malaya Specialist Centre, University of Malaya"}, "23498480900": {"Name": "Mun K.S.", "AuthorID": "23498480900", "AffiliationID": "60029157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University Malaya Specialist Centre, University of Malaya"}, "56212859600": {"Name": "Prepageran N.", "AuthorID": "56212859600", "AffiliationID": "60029157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, University Malaya Specialist Centre, University of Malaya"}, "57105716400": {"Name": "Hostettler I.C.", "AuthorID": "57105716400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Research Centre, University College London, Institute of Neurology"}}}
