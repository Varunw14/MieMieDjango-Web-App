Here we reassess 16 TS patients (age 19 \u00b1 2.3 years) who participated in a mental chronometry study of volition 5.5 years previously (Ganos C et al. Cortex. 2015 Mar.; 64:47\u201354), and 16 age-matched controls. Participants estimated the time of their own voluntary movements (Libet's M judgement), or of conscious intention to make voluntary movements (Libet's W judgement), in separate blocks. We considered M judgement as a control condition. Therefore, the experience of an intention to move occurring prior to actual movement onset, as measured by the W-M gap, was taken as the cardinal feature of volition. Time estimates of the TS group did not differ significantly from controls, for either M or W judgement. Further, M and W time estimates in the TS group had not changed significantly between the two assessments. However, exploratory analyses revealed a strong relation between disease duration and the development of M- and W-judgements: the longer was the disease duration, the less was the developmental increase in the W-M gap (linear regression, p = .003). In conclusion, our results suggest compromised development of experience of volition in developing TS patients. The developmental difficulty in processing internal premotor signals for voluntary actions could reflect the chronic persistence of tics from adolescence to adulthood.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Free will", "Intention awareness", "Libet experiment", "Tic disorder", "Tourette syndrome"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084519409", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"55780623700": {"Name": "Mainka T.", "AuthorID": "55780623700", "AffiliationID": "60126120", "AffiliationName": "Berlin Institute of Health"}, "56199451200": {"Name": "Borngr\u00e4ber F.", "AuthorID": "56199451200", "AffiliationID": "60126120", "AffiliationName": "Berlin Institute of Health"}, "37101265800": {"Name": "Ganos C.", "AuthorID": "37101265800", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Charit\u00e9 University Medicine Berlin"}, "56458997900": {"Name": "Di Costa S.", "AuthorID": "56458997900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60109771", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "7005933195": {"Name": "Haggard P.", "AuthorID": "7005933195", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60109771", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "56868536200": {"Name": "Barow E.", "AuthorID": "56868536200", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"}, "55230575800": {"Name": "M\u00fcnchau A.", "AuthorID": "55230575800", "AffiliationID": "60012408", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurogenetics, University of L\u00fcbeck"}}}
