TransRepair combines mutation with metamorphic testing to detect inconsistency bugs (without access to human oracles). It then adopts probability-reference or cross-reference to post-process the translations, in a grey-box or black-box manner, to repair the inconsistencies. Our evaluation on two state-of-the-art translators, Google Translate and Transformer, indicates that TransRepair has a high precision (99%) on generating input pairs with consistent translations. With these tests, using automatic consistency metrics and manual assessment, we find that Google Translate and Transformer have approximately 36% and 40% inconsistency bugs. Black-box repair fixes 28% and 19% bugs on average for Google Translate and Transformer. Grey-box repair fixes 30% bugs on average for Transformer. Manual inspection indicates that the translations repaired by our approach improve consistency in 87% of cases (degrading it in 2%), and that our repairs have better translation acceptability in 27% of the cases (worse in 8%).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Machine translation", "Testing and repair", "Translation consistency"], "IndexKeywords": ["Automatic approaches", "Google translate", "High-precision", "Machine translation systems", "Machine translations", "Manual inspection", "Metamorphic testing", "Post process"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85093111688", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"57211525326": {"Name": "Sun Z.", "AuthorID": "57211525326", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Hcst Peking University, MoE"}, "57209508429": {"Name": "Zhang J.M.", "AuthorID": "57209508429", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College"}, "7006379048": {"Name": "Harman M.", "AuthorID": "7006379048", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Facebook London University College"}, "57197295611": {"Name": "Papadakis M.", "AuthorID": "57197295611", "AffiliationID": "60072562", "AffiliationName": "University of Luxembourg"}, "56275778800": {"Name": "Zhang L.", "AuthorID": "56275778800", "AffiliationID": "60072562", "AffiliationName": "University of Luxembourg"}}}
