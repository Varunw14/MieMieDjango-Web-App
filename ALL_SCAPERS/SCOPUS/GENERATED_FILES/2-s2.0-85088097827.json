The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) with the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) have updated their national guidelines, whereas the Federation International of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada (SOGC) have developed new guidelines on the diagnosis and management of PAS. A comparison of these guidelines highlights common strong recommendations on the need to carefully evaluate women at high risk for PAS (e.g. prior uterine surgery presenting with anterior low-lying placenta or placenta previa), using multi-modal ultrasound imaging. For women diagnosed with PAS, multidisciplinary team-based care, with full logistic support structures (immediate access to comprehensive blood products, adult and neonatal intensive care) and established expertise in complex pelvic surgery, is critical to maximise safe outcomes for mothers and newborns.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Guidelines", "Increta", "Management", "Percreta", "Placenta accreta", "Prenatal diagnosis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088097827", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"57203176734": {"Name": "Jauniaux E.", "AuthorID": "57203176734", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EGA Institute for Women's Health, Faculty of Population Health Sciences, University College London (UCL)"}, "7004475800": {"Name": "Kingdom J.C.", "AuthorID": "7004475800", "AffiliationID": "60016849, 60006894", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Mount Sinai Hospital, University of Toronto"}, "57211674616": {"Name": "Silver R.M.", "AuthorID": "57211674616", "AffiliationID": "60016849, 60006894", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Mount Sinai Hospital, University of Toronto"}}}
