If over the years the potential of many GI approaches have been demonstrated, the intrinsic cost of evaluating real-world software makes comparing these approaches in large-scale meta-analyses very expensive. We propose and describe a method to construct synthetic GI benchmarks, to circumvent this bottleneck and enable much faster quality assessment of GI approaches.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Genetic improvement", "Search-based software engineering"], "IndexKeywords": ["Automated searches", "Genetic improvements", "Meta analysis", "Quality assessment", "Real-world", "Synthetic benchmark"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85093083513", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"55974628000": {"Name": "Blot A.", "AuthorID": "55974628000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "36615643200": {"Name": "Petke J.", "AuthorID": "36615643200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
