In a first assessment of spikelet-base assemblages within pottery sherds using quantitative microCT analysis, the authors found no additional rice remains within this sherd to support the early date of rice farming; analysis of a more recent Gua Sireh sherd (1990-830 cal BP), however, indicates that 70 per cent of spikelet bases are from domesticated rice. This technique offers a high degree of contextual and temporal resolution for approaching organic-tempered ceramics as well-preserved archaeobotanical assemblages.", "AuthorKeywords": ["archaeobotany", "Borneo", "Island Southeast Asia", "microCT", "rice domestication"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85093961933", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"], ["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"]], "AuthorData": {"57194283308": {"Name": "Barron A.", "AuthorID": "57194283308", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "School of Archaeology and Anthropology, Australian National University"}, "6602236565": {"Name": "Bellwood P.", "AuthorID": "6602236565", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "School of Archaeology and Anthropology, Australian National University"}, "57221026783": {"Name": "Wood R.", "AuthorID": "57221026783", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "Research School of Earth Sciences, Australian National University"}, "57216600604": {"Name": "Denham T.", "AuthorID": "57216600604", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "School of Archaeology and Anthropology, Australian National University"}, "15847899500": {"Name": "Datan I.", "AuthorID": "15847899500", "AffiliationID": "100607950", "AffiliationName": "Retired Director of Sarawak Museum"}, "57208724215": {"Name": "Fuller D.Q.", "AuthorID": "57208724215", "AffiliationID": "60001298", "AffiliationName": "Northwest University, School of Cultural Heritage"}}}
