Inconsistent test battery content and methodological heterogeneity might contribute to variable associations between hop test performance and subsequent injury. Our aim was to investigate whether commonly used hop tests are administered in a consistent manner and in accordance with reported guidelines. Methods We conducted a narrative review of studies that examined whether hop testing could differentiate RTS pass rates, reinjury and rerupture in athletes after ACL reconstruction. Our specific focus was on the methodological procedures of hop testing as this component is widely used to evaluate patients' function and readiness to RTS. Main findings Substantial variation exists in RTS hop test administration, scoring and interpretation. Authors often failed to report important details of methods such as warm up activities, randomisation, number of trials, rest periods and landing requirements. Conclusion We recommend researchers provide clearer descriptions of how hop tests are performed to increase standardisation and promote accurate data collection. Absence of reporting to describe test methods and using different test procedures makes it difficult to compare study findings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ACL", "exercise rehabilitation", "exercise testing"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086780692", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"], ["Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation", "HEAL", "3612"]], "AuthorData": {"55764420600": {"Name": "Read P.", "AuthorID": "55764420600", "AffiliationID": "60016721", "AffiliationName": "School of Sport and Exercise, University of Gloucestershire"}, "57207381672": {"Name": "Wilson M.G.", "AuthorID": "57207381672", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Sport Exercise and Health (ISEH), University College London"}, "57193153452": {"Name": "Mc Auliffe S.", "AuthorID": "57193153452", "AffiliationID": "60072749", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Sciences, Qatar University"}, "6701852696": {"Name": "Myer G.D.", "AuthorID": "6701852696", "AffiliationID": "113107857", "AffiliationName": "The Micheli Center for Sports Injury Prevention"}}}
