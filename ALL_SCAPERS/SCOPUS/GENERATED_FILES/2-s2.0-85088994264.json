The standard analysis algorithm, value iteration, only provides lower bounds on infinite-horizon probabilities and rewards. Two \u201csound\u201d variations, which also deliver an upper bound, have recently appeared. In this paper, we present a new sound approach that leverages value iteration\u2019s ability to usually deliver good lower bounds: we obtain a lower bound via standard value iteration, use the result to \u201cguess\u201d an upper bound, and prove the latter\u2019s correctness. We present this optimistic value iteration approach for computing reachability probabilities as well as expected rewards. It is easy to implement and performs well, as we show via an extensive experimental evaluation using our implementation within the mcsta model checker of the Modest Toolset.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Experimental evaluation", "Infinite horizons", "Leverages value", "Markov Decision Processes", "Optimistic value", "Standard analysis", "Standard values", "Value iteration"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088994264", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"35302479600": {"Name": "Hartmanns A.", "AuthorID": "35302479600", "AffiliationID": "60020599", "AffiliationName": "University of Twente"}, "47962346900": {"Name": "Kaminski B.L.", "AuthorID": "47962346900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
