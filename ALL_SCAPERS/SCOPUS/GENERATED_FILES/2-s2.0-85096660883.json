Capitalizing on the increasing interest on multisensory aspects of human-food interaction and the unique contribution that our community offers, we developed a space to discuss ideas ranging from mechanisms of multisensory food perception, through multisensory technologies, to new applications of systems in the context of MHFI. All in all, the workshop involved 11 contributions, which will hopefully further help shape the basis of a field of inquiry that grows as we see progress in our understanding of the senses and the development of new technologies in the context of food.", "AuthorKeywords": ["human-food interaction", "multisensory", "senses", "technology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Human food interactions", "Multisensory", "Netherlands", "New applications"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096660883", "SubjectAreas": [["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"]], "AuthorData": {"57202808530": {"Name": "Velasco C.", "AuthorID": "57202808530", "AffiliationID": "60007996", "AffiliationName": "Department of Marketing, Bi Norwegian Business School"}, "6701596614": {"Name": "Nijholt A.", "AuthorID": "6701596614", "AffiliationID": "60020599", "AffiliationName": "University of Twente, Human Media Interaction"}, "7102013693": {"Name": "Spence C.", "AuthorID": "7102013693", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford"}, "18936320200": {"Name": "Narumi T.", "AuthorID": "18936320200", "AffiliationID": "60025272, 60015682", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, University of Tokyo"}, "57189691781": {"Name": "Motoki K.", "AuthorID": "57189691781", "AffiliationID": "60026304", "AffiliationName": "Department of Food Science and Business, Miyagi University"}, "55504773000": {"Name": "Huisman G.", "AuthorID": "55504773000", "AffiliationID": "60103347", "AffiliationName": "Digital Society School, Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences"}, "22835490000": {"Name": "Obrist M.", "AuthorID": "22835490000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
