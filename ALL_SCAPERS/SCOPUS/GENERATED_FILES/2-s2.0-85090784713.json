We aimed to assess which intervention components and contextual factors may contribute to the successful delivery and implementation of primary care-led post-diagnostic dementia care. Methods: Mixed-methods systematic review. We searched five databases (inception-March 2019) with reference list screening and citation tracking. We included studies evaluating post-diagnostic dementia care interventions where primary care had a significant role in dementia care, which assessed one or more implementation elements (acceptability, feasibility, adoption, sustainability, reach, costs, appropriateness or fidelity). Two authors independently critically appraised studies. Results: Out of 4528 unique references, we screened 380 full texts and included 49 evaluations of services collecting implementation process data. Most services had high acceptability ratings. The most acceptable components were information provision, social and emotional support and links to community organisations. Feasibility was chiefly influenced by provider engagement and leadership, building dementia care capacity, sufficient resources/funding and collaboration. Care quality was maximised through adding capacity from a dementia-specific health professional. On the basis of limited data, costs for various primary care-led models did not substantially differ from each other. Conclusion: A range of primary care-led dementia care models appear feasible and acceptable. Future services should: add dementia-focussed health professionals into primary care, develop primary care leadership and provide sufficient funding and collaboration opportunities. Information, community service links and social and ongoing support should be part of services. Further exploration of service reach and formalised fidelity assessment are needed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["costs", "Dementia and cognitive disorders", "evaluation/effectiveness", "primary care", "systematic review", "types of services"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090784713", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatric Mental Health", "NURS", "2921"], ["Gerontology", "NURS", "2909"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57191471812": {"Name": "Frost R.", "AuthorID": "57191471812", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "6602151058": {"Name": "Rait G.", "AuthorID": "6602151058", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "35239306300": {"Name": "Wilcock J.", "AuthorID": "35239306300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "57203175207": {"Name": "Walters K.", "AuthorID": "57203175207", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "57195306490": {"Name": "Aw S.", "AuthorID": "57195306490", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore"}, "57216994952": {"Name": "Brunskill G.", "AuthorID": "57216994952", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Sciences Institute, Newcastle University"}, "16835708800": {"Name": "Robinson L.", "AuthorID": "16835708800", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Sciences Institute, Newcastle University"}, "57220660009": {"Name": "Knapp M.", "AuthorID": "57220660009", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "4Care Policy and Evaluation Centre (CPEC), Department of Health Policy, London School of Economics and Political Science"}, "57218916828": {"Name": "Hogan N.", "AuthorID": "57218916828", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "4Care Policy and Evaluation Centre (CPEC), Department of Health Policy, London School of Economics and Political Science"}, "36893703900": {"Name": "Harrison Dening K.", "AuthorID": "36893703900", "AffiliationID": "60112890", "AffiliationName": "Dementia UK"}, "57219322239": {"Name": "Allan L.", "AuthorID": "57219322239", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health Research, University of Exeter Medical School"}, "57202296197": {"Name": "Manthorpe J.", "AuthorID": "57202296197", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Policy Research Unit on Health and Social Care Workforce, Kings College London"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
