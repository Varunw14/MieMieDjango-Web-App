Their progress to use in the clinic could be accelerated by the development of new formulations employing suitable and complementary drug delivery vehicles. Methods: A robust method for apoferritin (AFt)-encapsulation of antitumour benzothiazoles has been developed for enhanced activity against and drug delivery to benzothiazole-sensitive cancers. Results: More than 70 molecules of benzothiazole 5F 203 were encapsulated per AFt cage. Post-encapsulation, the size and integrity of the protein cages were retained as evidenced by dynamic light scattering. ToF-SIMS depth profiling using an argon cluster beam confirmed 5F 203 exclusively within the AFt cavity. Improved encapsulation of benzothiazole lysyl-amide prodrugs was achieved (~130 molecules of Phortress per AFt cage). Transferrin receptor 1, TfR1, was detected in lysates prepared from most cancer cell lines studied, contributing to enhanced anticancer potency of the AFt-encapsulated benzothiazoles (5F 203, Phortress, GW 610, GW 608-Lys). Nanomolar activity was demonstrated by AFt-formulations in breast, ovarian, renal and gastric carcinoma cell lines, whereas GI50 >50 \u00b5M was observed in non-tumourigenic MRC-5 fibroblasts. Intracellular 5F 203, a potent aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligand, and inducible expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1 were detected following exposure of sensitive cells to AFt-5F 203, confirming that the activity of benzothiazoles was not compromised following encapsulation. Conclusion: Our results show enhanced potency and selectivity of AFt-encapsulated 5F 203 against carcinomas derived from breast, ovarian, renal, colorectal as well as gastric cancer models, and offer realistic prospects for potential refinement of tumour-targeting and treatment, and merit further in vivo investigations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anticancer activity", "Apoferritin", "Benzothiazole", "Drug delivery", "Transferrin receptor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antineoplastic Agents", "Apoferritins", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Female", "Humans", "Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon", "Thiazoles"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076354292", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"57212271926": {"Name": "Breen A.F.", "AuthorID": "57212271926", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomolecular Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Nottingham"}, "8426889000": {"Name": "Scurr D.", "AuthorID": "8426889000", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomolecular Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Nottingham"}, "57198862281": {"Name": "Cassioli M.L.", "AuthorID": "57198862281", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomolecular Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Nottingham"}, "7005959390": {"Name": "Bradshaw T.D.", "AuthorID": "7005959390", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomolecular Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Nottingham"}, "7202079131": {"Name": "Wells G.", "AuthorID": "7202079131", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7401829381": {"Name": "Thomas N.R.", "AuthorID": "7401829381", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomolecular Sciences, School of Chemistry, University of Nottingham"}, "56003828200": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "56003828200", "AffiliationID": "60020675", "AffiliationName": "Medical School, Kunming University of Science and Technology"}, "8335024600": {"Name": "Turyanska L.", "AuthorID": "8335024600", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering, University of Nottingham"}}}
