For this reason, the topic has gained increased attention over the last decade from multiple stakeholder parties e.g. academia, hospital pharmacy, the medical device and pharmaceutical industry, and regulatory agencies. It is now well acknowledged that spoons and cups are not suitable for the measurement of small volumes of oral liquid medicines and that syringes are a better alternative, but syringes for parenteral use should not be used for oral dosing in order to avoid accidental parenteral delivery of oral products. However, dosing accuracy of very small volumes of liquid medicines to young children, and especially pre-term neonates, is still not sufficiently ensured. A workshop was organised in 2018 by the European Paediatric Formulation Initiative to reflect on current status and challenges (first part) and possible strategies to improve the present situation (second part). A voting system (n = 24) was used to consider the most favourable solutions. The harmonisation and/or standardisation of the technical design of oral syringes (including e.g. female/male connection) was considered a key priority.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Administration oral", "Dosing accuracy", "Drug development", "EMA", "Infant", "Medical device", "Medication error", "Medication safety", "Newborn", "Paediatric"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083338248", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"7404416719": {"Name": "Walsh J.", "AuthorID": "7404416719", "AffiliationID": "112876997", "AffiliationName": "Jenny Walsh Consulting Ltd"}, "8707367200": {"Name": "van Riet-Nales D.", "AuthorID": "8707367200", "AffiliationID": "60113759", "AffiliationName": "Medicines Evaluation Board"}, "56545163000": {"Name": "de Vries R.", "AuthorID": "56545163000", "AffiliationID": "60113759", "AffiliationName": "Medicines Evaluation Board"}, "57216373790": {"Name": "Hermans E.", "AuthorID": "57216373790", "AffiliationID": "60068574", "AffiliationName": "Janssen Pharmaceutica NV (Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson)"}, "57216365310": {"Name": "Hilton G.", "AuthorID": "57216365310", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "AstraZeneca"}, "57216361963": {"Name": "Blowers P.", "AuthorID": "57216361963", "AffiliationID": "60105169", "AffiliationName": "AbbVie Inc."}, "45861750300": {"Name": "Salunke S.", "AuthorID": "45861750300", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "European Paediatric Formulation Initiative (EuPFI), University College London School of Pharmacy"}}}
