The intervention contrasted \u201cDirect Mapping and Set-for-Variability\u201d with a \u201cCommon and Best Practices\u201d taught control condition in a matched quasi-experimental design. To test claims of cross-linguistic transfer, measures of English and French word reading were administered before and after intervention. Hierarchical linear modeling analyses confirmed that children in the intervention condition showed improved performance at posttest on measures of English and French regular, exception, and pseudoword reading compared to the control condition. Intervention-specific cross language effects on French word and pseudoword reading shown here provide partial support for causal models of transfer in bilingual reading development.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092686572", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Psychology (miscellaneous)", "PSYC", "3201"]], "AuthorData": {"56740241300": {"Name": "C\u00f4t\u00e9 M.F.", "AuthorID": "56740241300", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Educational Psychology, Faculty of Education, McGill University"}, "7102776376": {"Name": "Savage R.", "AuthorID": "7102776376", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Human Development, Institute of Education, University College London"}, "12345328300": {"Name": "Petscher Y.", "AuthorID": "12345328300", "AffiliationID": "60002092", "AffiliationName": "Florida Centre for Reading Research, Florida State University"}}}
