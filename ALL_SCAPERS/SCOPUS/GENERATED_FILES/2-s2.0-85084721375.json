To address the problem of multimodality, it is desirable to learn local metrics. In this short paper, we define a new intuitive distance with local metrics and influential regions, and subsequently propose a novel local metric learning algorithm called LMLIR for distance-based classification. Our key intuition is to partition the metric space into influential regions and a background region, and then regulate the effectiveness of each local metric to be within the related influential regions. We learn multiple local metrics and influential regions to reduce the empirical hinge loss, and regularize the parameters on the basis of a resultant learning bound. Encouraging experimental results are obtained from various public and popular data sets.", "AuthorKeywords": ["distance metric", "Distance-based classification", "local metric", "metric learning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Background region", "Distance metrics", "Distance-based classification", "Distance-based classifiers", "Metric spaces", "Multi-modality"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084721375", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"57195451262": {"Name": "Dong M.", "AuthorID": "57195451262", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "57216804816": {"Name": "Yang X.", "AuthorID": "57216804816", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "7202881908": {"Name": "Xue J.H.", "AuthorID": "7202881908", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "57201799986": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "57201799986", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computing, Imperial College London"}}}
