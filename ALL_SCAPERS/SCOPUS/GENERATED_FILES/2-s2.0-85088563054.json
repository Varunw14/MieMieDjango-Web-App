However, the HCI or adaptive design of such environments often receive less attention. Eye-tracking and click data were used to compare four versions of an IC-training game in terms of their HCI design and potential for supporting adaptive feedback. Our results provide insights for developing an adaptive system to scaffold pupils\u2019 transition towards using IC in un-cued, self-regulated scenarios.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adaptive support", "Counterintuitive reasoning", "Educational neuroscience", "Game-based learning", "Inhibitory control"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptive designs", "Adaptive feedback", "Adaptive training", "Clickstreams", "HCI design"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088563054", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"56605912700": {"Name": "Gauthier A.", "AuthorID": "56605912700", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Knowledge Lab, Institute of Education, University College London"}, "7801505406": {"Name": "Porayska-Pomsta K.", "AuthorID": "7801505406", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Knowledge Lab, Institute of Education, University College London"}, "7004069522": {"Name": "Mareschal D.", "AuthorID": "7004069522", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck College University of London"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
