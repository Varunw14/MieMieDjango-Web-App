In Information Retrieval (IR), a series of query reformulations is known as a query-session. Research in IR evaluation has traditionally been focused on the development of measures for the ad hoc task, for which a retrieval system aims to retrieve the best documents for a single query. Thus, most IR evaluation measures, with a few exceptions, are not suitable to evaluate retrieval scenarios that call for multiple refinements over a query-session. In this paper, by formally modeling a user's expected behaviour over query-sessions, we derive a session-based evaluation measure, which results in a generalization of the evaluation measure Rank Biased Precision (RBP). We demonstrate the quality of this new session-based evaluation measure, named Session RBP (sRBP), by evaluating its user model against the observed user behaviour over the query-sessions of the 2014 TREC Session track.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Retrieval evaluation", "Session search", "SRBP", "User model"], "IndexKeywords": ["Evaluation measures", "Query reformulation", "Retrieval evaluation", "Retrieval systems", "Session search", "SRBP", "User behaviour", "User Modeling"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074239544", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (miscellaneous)", "COMP", "1701"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"]], "AuthorData": {"56342379600": {"Name": "Lipani A.", "AuthorID": "56342379600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57203056765": {"Name": "Yilmaz E.", "AuthorID": "57203056765", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6507636450": {"Name": "Carterette B.", "AuthorID": "6507636450", "AffiliationID": "60109119", "AffiliationName": "Spotify"}}}
