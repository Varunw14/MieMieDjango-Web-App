Herein, we aimed to assess the survival impact of anatomic site of origin in prospective clinical trials of aBTC using landmark survival analysis. Methods: Patients enrolled into prospective first-line aBTC clinical trials (Jan 97\u2013Dec 15) were included. Overall survival (OS) was analysed using Cox proportional hazard regression; landmark survival (LS) and 95% CIs were calculated. Results: Overall, 1,333 patients were included: median age 63 years (range 23\u201385); 46% male; 84% ECOG-PS0/1; 25% with locally advanced disease, 72% with metastatic, 3% not reported (NR). Patients were treated with mono-chemotherapy (23%), cisplatin/gemcitabine (36%), other combinations (39%), or NR (2%). Median OS was 10.2 months (95% CI 9.6\u201310.9). All sites (treatment-adjusted) had decreased risk of death vs. gallbladder cancer (GBC) (p <0.001). This reduced risk vs. GBC was maintained in those receiving cisplatin/gemcitabine for extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (p <0.001) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHC, p <0.001), but not in cholangiocarcinoma-not specified (CCA-NS, p = 0.82) or ampullary carcinoma (p = 0.96). One-year OS rates amongst patients who survived beyond 1, 2, 3 and 4 years post-trial registration were 37%, 45%, 61%, and 63%, respectively. For patients who survived 1 year, those receiving combination therapy vs. mono (p = 0.008) (acknowledging potential selection bias) and those with IHC and CCA-NS vs. GBC had better LS (both p <0.05). Metastatic disease was associated with shorter LS than locally advanced disease (p = 0.002). ECOG-PS and gender were not associated with LS (p >0.05, p = 0.08 respectively). Conclusions: GBC is associated with worse OS than other BTC sites and should be considered as a stratification factor in clinical trials. LS rates enable adjusted prognostication for aBTC survivors. Lay summary: Patients with gallbladder cancer have worse overall survival compared to those with biliary tract cancers of different primary origin. Thus, gallbladder cancer should be considered as a stratification factor in future clinical trials. Landmark survival rates enable adjusted prognosis prediction for patients with advanced biliary tract cancer who survive for some time.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biliary tract cancer", "First-line clinical trials", "Landmark survival", "Overall survival", "Primary site"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089859916", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"]], "AuthorData": {"7102741810": {"Name": "McNamara M.G.", "AuthorID": "7102741810", "AffiliationID": "60028784, 60003771", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cancer Sciences, The University of Manchester and The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7101953217": {"Name": "Valle J.W.", "AuthorID": "7101953217", "AffiliationID": "60028784, 60003771", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cancer Sciences, The University of Manchester and The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56719092100": {"Name": "Lopes A.", "AuthorID": "56719092100", "AffiliationID": "60012754, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK & UCL Cancer Trials Centre"}, "6701461568": {"Name": "Wasan H.", "AuthorID": "6701461568", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Imperial Healthcare"}, "6701500379": {"Name": "Malka D.", "AuthorID": "6701500379", "AffiliationID": "60027386", "AffiliationName": "Institut Gustave Roussy"}, "55757206600": {"Name": "Goldstein D.", "AuthorID": "55757206600", "AffiliationID": "60011463, 60028333", "AffiliationName": "Prince of Wales Clinical School, University of New South Wales"}, "36015790700": {"Name": "Shannon J.", "AuthorID": "36015790700", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "University of Sydney"}, "7003950274": {"Name": "Okusaka T.", "AuthorID": "7003950274", "AffiliationID": "60018424", "AffiliationName": "National Cancer Center Hospital"}, "7202078898": {"Name": "Knox J.J.", "AuthorID": "7202078898", "AffiliationID": "60008768", "AffiliationName": "Princess Margaret Cancer Centre"}, "14027656000": {"Name": "Wagner A.D.", "AuthorID": "14027656000", "AffiliationID": "60023561", "AffiliationName": "Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois"}, "55944312600": {"Name": "Andr\u00e9 T.", "AuthorID": "55944312600", "AffiliationID": "60009907, 60001422", "AffiliationName": "Sorbonne universit\u00e9 and H\u00f4pital Saint-Antoine"}, "57208871928": {"Name": "Cunningham D.", "AuthorID": "57208871928", "AffiliationID": "105636777", "AffiliationName": "Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "6601954970": {"Name": "Moehler M.", "AuthorID": "6601954970", "AffiliationID": "60022135", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Mainz"}, "7403326719": {"Name": "Jensen L.H.", "AuthorID": "7403326719", "AffiliationID": "60033419", "AffiliationName": "Vejle University Hospital"}, "22234011100": {"Name": "Koeberle D.", "AuthorID": "22234011100", "AffiliationID": "60069242", "AffiliationName": "Leiter Medizinische Klinik, Chefarzt Onkologie, St. Claraspital"}, "8643412400": {"Name": "Bekaii-Saab T.", "AuthorID": "8643412400", "AffiliationID": "60026952", "AffiliationName": "Mayo Clinic"}, "7003634798": {"Name": "Bridgewater J.", "AuthorID": "7003634798", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute"}}}
