Cognitive Science published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of Cognitive Science Society (CSS).The temporal-focus hypothesis claims that whether people conceptualize the past or the future as in front of them depends on their cultural attitudes toward time; such conceptualizations can be independent from the space\u2013time metaphors expressed through language. In this paper, we study how Chinese people conceptualize time on the sagittal axis to find out the respective influences of language and culture on mental space\u2013time mappings. An examination of Mandarin speakers' co-speech gestures shows that some Chinese spontaneously perform past-in-front/future-at-back (besides future-in-front/past-at-back) gestures, especially when gestures are accompanying past-in-front/future-at-back space\u2013time metaphors (Exp. 1). Using a temporal performance task, the study confirms that Chinese can conceptualize the future as behind and the past as in front of them, and that such space\u2013time mappings are affected by the different expressions of Mandarin space\u2013time metaphors (Exp. 2). Additionally, a survey on cultural attitudes toward time shows that Chinese tend to focus slightly more on the future than on the past (Exp. 3). Within the Chinese sample, we did not find evidence for the effect of participants' cultural temporal attitudes on space\u2013time mappings, but a cross-cultural comparison of space\u2013time mappings between Chinese, Moroccans, and Spaniards provides strong support for the temporal-focus hypothesis. Furthermore, the results of Exp. 2 are replicated even after controlling for factors such as cultural temporal attitudes and age (Exp. 3), which implies that linguistic sagittal temporal metaphors can indeed influence Mandarin speakers' space\u2013time mappings. The findings not only contribute to a better understanding of Chinese people's sagittal temporal orientation, but also have additional implications for theories on the mental space\u2013time mappings and the relationship between language and thought.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chinese", "Cross-cultural differences", "Gesture and conceptual metaphor", "Language and thought", "Space and time", "Temporal-focus hypothesis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "China", "Cross-Cultural Comparison", "Female", "Gestures", "Humans", "Language", "Male", "Space Perception", "Spain", "Time Perception", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076891129", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"57193230572": {"Name": "Gu Y.", "AuthorID": "57193230572", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "7003962295": {"Name": "Swerts M.", "AuthorID": "7003962295", "AffiliationID": "60115979, 60017145", "AffiliationName": "Tilburg Center for Cognition and Communication, Tilburg University"}, "57210153209": {"Name": "Zheng Y.", "AuthorID": "57210153209", "AffiliationID": "60017145", "AffiliationName": "Department of Econometrics and Operations Research, Tilburg University"}}}
