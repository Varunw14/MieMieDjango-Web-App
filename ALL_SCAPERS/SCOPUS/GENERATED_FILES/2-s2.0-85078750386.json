Epigenetic imprinting plays an important role herein, involving histone modification after pathogen-/danger-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs/DAMPs) recognition by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Such \u201ctrained immunity\u201d affects not only the nominal target pathogen, yet also non-related targets that may be encountered later in life. The concept of trained innate immunity warrants further exploration in cancer and how these insights can be implemented in immunotherapeutic approaches. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of innate immune memory and we reference new findings in this field, highlighting the observations of trained immunity in monocytic and natural killer cells. We also provide a brief overview of trained immunity in non-immune cells, such as stromal cells and fibroblasts. Finally, we present possible strategies based on trained innate immunity that may help to devise host-directed immunotherapies focusing on cancer, with possible extension to infectious diseases.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cancer", "dendritic cells", "immune responses", "immunotherapy", "inflammation", "macrophages", "pathogens", "trained immunity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078750386", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"]], "AuthorData": {"57197865346": {"Name": "L\u00e9rias J.R.", "AuthorID": "57197865346", "AffiliationID": "60113882", "AffiliationName": "ImmunoSurgery Unit, Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown"}, "57208627940": {"Name": "de Sousa E.", "AuthorID": "57208627940", "AffiliationID": "60113882", "AffiliationName": "ImmunoSurgery Unit, Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown"}, "57201588800": {"Name": "Paraschoudi G.", "AuthorID": "57201588800", "AffiliationID": "60113882", "AffiliationName": "ImmunoSurgery Unit, Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown"}, "57208629863": {"Name": "Martins J.", "AuthorID": "57208629863", "AffiliationID": "60113882", "AffiliationName": "ImmunoSurgery Unit, Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown"}, "57208623945": {"Name": "Conde\u00e7o C.", "AuthorID": "57208623945", "AffiliationID": "60113882", "AffiliationName": "ImmunoSurgery Unit, Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown"}, "55546020300": {"Name": "Dodoo E.", "AuthorID": "55546020300", "AffiliationID": "60113882", "AffiliationName": "ImmunoSurgery Unit, Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown"}, "57216111663": {"Name": "Rao M.", "AuthorID": "57216111663", "AffiliationID": "60113882", "AffiliationName": "ImmunoSurgery Unit, Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown"}, "7004422039": {"Name": "Maeurer M.", "AuthorID": "7004422039", "AffiliationID": "60113882", "AffiliationName": "ImmunoSurgery Unit, Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown"}, "57007987100": {"Name": "Figueiredo N.", "AuthorID": "57007987100", "AffiliationID": "60196704", "AffiliationName": "Digestive Unit, Champalimaud Clinical Centre"}, "14063001800": {"Name": "Carvalho C.", "AuthorID": "14063001800", "AffiliationID": "60196704", "AffiliationName": "Digestive Unit, Champalimaud Clinical Centre"}, "57214468068": {"Name": "Maia A.", "AuthorID": "57214468068", "AffiliationID": "60113882", "AffiliationName": "Molecular and Experimental Pathology Laboratory, Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown"}, "24775161100": {"Name": "Castillo-Martin M.", "AuthorID": "24775161100", "AffiliationID": "60196704", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Champalimaud Clinical Centre"}, "7006241487": {"Name": "Beltr\u00e1n A.", "AuthorID": "7006241487", "AffiliationID": "60196704", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Champalimaud Clinical Centre"}, "14633861700": {"Name": "Ligeiro D.", "AuthorID": "14633861700", "AffiliationID": "60196684", "AffiliationName": "Lisbon Centre for Blood and Transplantation, Instituto Portugu\u00eas do Sangue e Transplanta\u00e7\u00e3o"}, "7006170723": {"Name": "Zumla A.", "AuthorID": "7006170723", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60176023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, UCL Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust, University College London"}}}
