However, there are substantial variations in the cell surface expression levels of human TCRs, which can impair the function of engineered T cells. Here we demonstrate that substitutions of 3 amino acid residues in the framework of the TCR variable domains consistently increase the expression of human TCRs on the surface of engineered T cells.The modified TCRs mediate enhanced T cell proliferation, cytokine production and cytotoxicity, while reducing the peptide concentration required for triggering effector function up to 3000-fold. Adoptive transfer experiments in mice show that modified TCRs control tumor growth more efficiently than wild-type TCRs. Our data indicate that simple variable domain modifications at a distance from the antigen-binding loops lead to increased TCR expression and improved effector function. This finding provides a generic platform to optimize the efficacy of TCR gene therapy in humans.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antigens", "Antigens, CD", "Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte", "Cell Engineering", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Proliferation", "Cytokines", "Gene Expression", "Genes, T-Cell Receptor", "Genetic Therapy", "Humans", "Lectins, C-Type", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred NOD", "Mice, SCID", "Models, Molecular", "Protein Domains", "Protein Engineering", "Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell", "T-Lymphocytes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072848099", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"7404655003": {"Name": "Thomas S.", "AuthorID": "7404655003", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57195204229": {"Name": "Woolston A.", "AuthorID": "57195204229", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57211162291": {"Name": "Stauss T.", "AuthorID": "57211162291", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7401653703": {"Name": "Kennedy A.", "AuthorID": "7401653703", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57211161745": {"Name": "Stirling D.", "AuthorID": "57211161745", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "16549320200": {"Name": "Holler A.", "AuthorID": "16549320200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57211162071": {"Name": "Green L.", "AuthorID": "57211162071", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "35509213600": {"Name": "Chain B.M.", "AuthorID": "35509213600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "8747891100": {"Name": "Morris E.C.", "AuthorID": "8747891100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57202567329": {"Name": "Stauss H.J.", "AuthorID": "57202567329", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7004659902": {"Name": "Mohammed F.", "AuthorID": "7004659902", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60170340", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy Centre, Institute for Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston"}, "6603702424": {"Name": "Willcox B.E.", "AuthorID": "6603702424", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60170340", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy Centre, Institute for Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston"}, "8343728800": {"Name": "Reijmers R.M.", "AuthorID": "8343728800", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "7004561258": {"Name": "Heemskerk M.H.M.", "AuthorID": "7004561258", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "57203189821": {"Name": "Jones D.", "AuthorID": "57203189821", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "55443016600": {"Name": "Matthews K.K.", "AuthorID": "55443016600", "AffiliationID": "60103683", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Cardiff University School of Medicine"}, "7403719208": {"Name": "Price D.A.", "AuthorID": "7403719208", "AffiliationID": "60103683", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Cardiff University School of Medicine"}}}
