The formation of the hollow microspheres with a double-shell was a result of the Kirkendall effect during the solvothermal treatment with concentrated NaOH. The advanced architecture significantly enhanced the electronic properties of TiO2\u2212x/W18O49, improving by more than 30 times the CO2photoreduction efficiency compared to the pristine W18O49.OperandoDRIFTS measurements revealed that the yellow TiO2\u2212xwas a preferable CO2adsorption and conversion site.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Advanced architecture", "Core-shell microspheres", "Double shells", "Hollow microsphere", "Kirkendall effects", "Solvothermal method", "Solvothermal treatment", "Visible light"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092664525", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57118643400": {"Name": "Tan J.Z.Y.", "AuthorID": "57118643400", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "Research Centre for Carbon Solutions (RCCS), Heriot-Watt University"}, "57207195646": {"Name": "Gavrielides S.", "AuthorID": "57207195646", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "Research Centre for Carbon Solutions (RCCS), Heriot-Watt University"}, "57190132184": {"Name": "Belekoukia M.", "AuthorID": "57190132184", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "Research Centre for Carbon Solutions (RCCS), Heriot-Watt University"}, "57189234112": {"Name": "Thompson W.A.", "AuthorID": "57189234112", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "Research Centre for Carbon Solutions (RCCS), Heriot-Watt University"}, "7003265799": {"Name": "Maroto-Valer M.M.", "AuthorID": "7003265799", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "Research Centre for Carbon Solutions (RCCS), Heriot-Watt University"}, "55907463800": {"Name": "Negahdar L.", "AuthorID": "55907463800", "AffiliationID": "60170248, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "UK Catalysis Hub, Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "8889480300": {"Name": "Beale A.M.", "AuthorID": "8889480300", "AffiliationID": "60170248, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "UK Catalysis Hub, Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "7102810091": {"Name": "Xia F.", "AuthorID": "7102810091", "AffiliationID": "60019939", "AffiliationName": "College of Science, Health, Engineering and Education, Murdoch University"}}}
