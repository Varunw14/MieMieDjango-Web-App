A key plant trait is the xylem specific hydraulic conductivity (Kx), that describes the plant's vascular system capacity to transport water. While xylem's vessels and tracheids are dead upon maturity, the xylem is neither inert nor deadwood, various components of the sapwood and surrounding tissue remaining alive and functional. Moreover, the established definition of Kx assumes linear relations between water flux and pressure gradient by tacitly considering the xylem as a \u201cpassive conduit\u201d. Here, we re-examine this notion of an inert xylem by systematically characterizing xylem flow in several woody plants using Kx measurements under constant and cyclic pressure gradients. Results show a temporal and pressure gradient dependence of Kx. Additionally, microscopic features in \u201cliving branches\u201d are irreversibly modified upon drying of the xylem, thus differentiating the macroscopic definition of Kx for living and dead xylem. The findings highlight the picture of the xylem as a complex and delicate conductive system whose hydraulic behaviour transcends a passive gradient-based flow. The study sheds new light on xylem conceptualization, conductivity measurement protocols, in situ long-distance water transport and ecosystem modelling.", "AuthorKeywords": ["plant hydraulic traits", "plant vascular system", "sapflow", "xylem conductivity measurements"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092514443", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Plant Science", "AGRI", "1110"]], "AuthorData": {"56083898500": {"Name": "Bonetti S.", "AuthorID": "56083898500", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Soil and Terrestrial Environmental Physics, Department of Environmental Systems Science, ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "57194139763": {"Name": "Breitenstein D.", "AuthorID": "57194139763", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Soil and Terrestrial Environmental Physics, Department of Environmental Systems Science, ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "57204340741": {"Name": "Or D.", "AuthorID": "57204340741", "AffiliationID": "60023439", "AffiliationName": "Division of Hydrologic Sciences, Desert Research Institute"}, "35203227000": {"Name": "Fatichi S.", "AuthorID": "35203227000", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, National University of Singapore"}, "56788146000": {"Name": "Domec J.C.", "AuthorID": "56788146000", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Nicholas School of the Environment, Duke University"}}}
