Unlike previous methods, which have focused on evaluating specific strategies against specific pandemics, our method allows assessment of mass immunisation strategies in presence and absence of antiviral drugs for a large range of pandemic influenza strain characteristics and programme features. Overall, the model described here combines two parts to evaluate different preparedness planning policies against pandemic influenza. \u2022 The first part is adaptation of an existing transmission model for seasonal influenza to include generalisation across large number of pandemic influenza scenarios. \u2022 The second part is development of a tailor-made health economic model devised in collaboration with colleagues at the UK Department of Health and Social Care.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Economic analysis", "Epidemiological model", "Pandemic influenza", "Transmission model and cost-benefit analysis for pandemic influenza planning"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082866746", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Medical Laboratory Technology", "HEAL", "3607"]], "AuthorData": {"55390602700": {"Name": "Panovska-Griffiths J.", "AuthorID": "55390602700", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "The Queen's College, Oxford University"}, "57217338436": {"Name": "Grieco L.", "AuthorID": "57217338436", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Operational Research Unit, University College London"}, "57201081414": {"Name": "Utley M.", "AuthorID": "57201081414", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Operational Research Unit, University College London"}, "18234388200": {"Name": "van Leeuwen E.", "AuthorID": "18234388200", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "56409734200": {"Name": "Grove P.", "AuthorID": "56409734200", "AffiliationID": "60008063", "AffiliationName": "UK Department of Health and Social Care"}}}
