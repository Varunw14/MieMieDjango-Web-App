However, most of these systems communicate data through information visualizations that are often 'hidden' inside devices, such as mobile phones and tablets, requiring users to undertake explicit actions to reveal them. Novel interfaces and devices embedded in people's everyday life have the potential to help users visualize, use, and appropriate their collected personal data. To this end, we designed the physical artifact LOOP, which provides an abstract visualization of the user's activity data by changing its shape. In this paper, we elaborate on the design and present a one-week field study in which LOOP was deployed in the homes of five end-users. We found that the physical presence of LOOP facilitated reflection and the layered visualization supported various personal tracking.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ambient Information Systems", "Physical Visualization", "Self-Tracking", "Shape-Changing Interfaces"], "IndexKeywords": ["End users", "Field studies", "Information visualization", "Internet of Things (IOT)", "Personal health", "Physical artifacts", "Social connection"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095858729", "SubjectAreas": [["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"57194789490": {"Name": "Sauv\u00e9 K.", "AuthorID": "57194789490", "AffiliationID": "60117772, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "School of Computing and Communications, Lancaster University"}, "55247206500": {"Name": "Houben S.", "AuthorID": "55247206500", "AffiliationID": "60117772, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "School of Computing and Communications, Lancaster University"}, "18933354000": {"Name": "Bakker S.", "AuthorID": "18933354000", "AffiliationID": "60016561", "AffiliationName": "Philips Experience Design"}, "55921115600": {"Name": "Marquardt N.", "AuthorID": "55921115600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Ucl Interaction Centre, University College London"}}}
