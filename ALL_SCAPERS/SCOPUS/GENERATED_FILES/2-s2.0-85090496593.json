Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of The Nutrition Society.Objective:Dietary pattern analysis constitutes a suitable method for identifying complex food preferences as well as a useful tool for comparing dietary behaviour across individual populations. In addition to a lack of information on Central European dietary patterns, dietary data featuring a longitudinal aspect are likewise largely unavailable for the region. Our study thus strives to address this gap by analysing children's dietary patterns, their stability and possible changes at 7, 11 and 15 years in the Czech part of the European Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (ELSPAC-CZ).Design:We analysed dietary data based on the self-reported semi-quantitative FFQ obtained in 1998, 2002 and 2006. Dietary patterns were derived using factor analysis for each period, followed by the determination of dietary pattern stability across the individual periods.Setting:The analysis of dietary patterns was based on longitudinal children's dietary data from the geographical region that was undergoing massive socio-economic changes at the time of birth of the study subjects.Participants:All participants were children. At 7 years the analysis included 3220 children, at 11 years the analysis included 2509 children and at 15 years the analysis included 1589 children.Results:Two stable children's dietary patterns labelled as 'prudent' and 'junk food' were identified across all three time points (7, 11 and 15 years).Conclusions:This study identifies stable longitudinal trends in the dietary behaviour of children enrolled in the ELSPAC-CZ study.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Children", "Cohort study", "Diet", "Dietary patterns", "European Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood", "FFQ", "Longitudinality"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090496593", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57200314659": {"Name": "Grulichov\u00e1 M.", "AuthorID": "57200314659", "AffiliationID": "60029543", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathological Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University"}, "37019087400": {"Name": "Zl\u00e1mal F.", "AuthorID": "37019087400", "AffiliationID": "60029543", "AffiliationName": "Research Centre for Toxic Compounds in the Environment (RECETOX), Masaryk University"}, "21933625600": {"Name": "Bienertov\u00e1-Va\u0161k\u016f J.", "AuthorID": "21933625600", "AffiliationID": "60029543", "AffiliationName": "Research Centre for Toxic Compounds in the Environment (RECETOX), Masaryk University"}, "57151274900": {"Name": "Andr\u00fdskov\u00e1 L.", "AuthorID": "57151274900", "AffiliationID": "60029543", "AffiliationName": "Research Centre for Toxic Compounds in the Environment (RECETOX), Masaryk University"}, "57189607599": {"Name": "\u0160vancara J.", "AuthorID": "57189607599", "AffiliationID": "60029543", "AffiliationName": "Research Centre for Toxic Compounds in the Environment (RECETOX), Masaryk University"}, "6602081223": {"Name": "Pikhart H.", "AuthorID": "6602081223", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
