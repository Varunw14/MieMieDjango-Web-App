All rights reserved.We revisit the photoelectron spectroscopy of aqueous phenol in an effort to improve our understanding of the impact of inhomogeneous broadening and inelastic scattering on solution-phase photoelectron spectra. Following resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionisation via the 11pp* and 11ps* states of phenol, we observe 11pp*\u2013D0/D1 ionisation and competing direct S0\u2013D0/D1 ionisation. Following resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionisation via the 21pp* state, we observe the signature of solvated electrons. By comparing the photoelectron spectra of aqueous phenol with those of gas-phase phenol, we find that inelastic scattering results in peak shifts with similar values to those that have been observed in photoelectron spectra of solvated electrons, highlighting the need for a robust way of deconvoluting the effect of inelastic scattering from liquid-phase photoelectron spectra. We also present a computational strategy for calculating vertical ionisation energies using a quantum-mechanics/effective fragmentation potential (QM/EFP) approach, in which we find that optimising the configurations obtained from molecular dynamics simulations and using the [phenol$(H2O)5]QM[(H2O)n$250]EFP (B3LYP/aug-cc-pvdz) method gives good agreement with experiment.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Computational strategy", "Computational studies", "Inhomogeneous broadening", "Ionisation energies", "Molecular dynamics simulations", "Multiphoton ionisation", "Photoelectron spectrum", "Resonance enhanced"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076447662", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57189599835": {"Name": "Henley A.", "AuthorID": "57189599835", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57195403564": {"Name": "Riley J.W.", "AuthorID": "57195403564", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57200699159": {"Name": "Wang B.", "AuthorID": "57200699159", "AffiliationID": "60073720", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Henan Institute of Science and Technology"}, "7003283537": {"Name": "Fielding H.H.", "AuthorID": "7003283537", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
