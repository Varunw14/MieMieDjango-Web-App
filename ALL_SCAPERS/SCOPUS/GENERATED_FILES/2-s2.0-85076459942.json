In mammalian species, a variety of different brain circuits are known to participate in this crucial survival behavior. One of these circuits is the periaqueductal gray, a midbrain structure that can command a variety of instinctive behaviors. Recent experiments using modern systems neuroscience techniques have begun to elucidate the specific role of the periaqueductal gray in controlling escape. These have shown that periaqueductal gray neurons are crucial units for gating and commanding the initiation of escape, specifically activated in situations of imminent, escapable threat. In addition, it is becoming clear that the periaqueductal gray integrates brain-wide information that can modulate escape initiation to generate flexible defensive behaviors.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Behavior, Animal", "Escape Reaction", "Neurons", "Periaqueductal Gray"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076459942", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"23477754500": {"Name": "Lefler Y.", "AuthorID": "23477754500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "UCL Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour"}, "56642856600": {"Name": "Campagner D.", "AuthorID": "56642856600", "AffiliationID": "60084280", "AffiliationName": "UCL Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit"}, "6603276934": {"Name": "Branco T.", "AuthorID": "6603276934", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "UCL Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour"}}}
