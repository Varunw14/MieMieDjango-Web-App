There is a wide range of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) issues important to these patients. Any new instrument developed to measure HRQoL of such patients should be content valid, i.e., the items should be comprehensively relevant to the patients and their health condition. The aim of the present study was to examine content validity of a hematological malignancy specific patient reported outcome measure (HM-PRO) developed for use in routine clinical practice. Methods: Following literature review and semi-structured interviews, the generated themes and sub-themes were discussed to develop the prototype version of the HM-PRO. A 4-step approach was used for content validation: initial testing and cognitive interviewing; item rating; content validity panel meeting; final field testing and cognitive interviewing. Additional questions related to patients\u2019 perception of recall period and preferred sentence structure (i.e., question or statement) of the items were also asked during cognitive interviews. Results: The content analysis of 129 transcribed semi-structured interviews resulted in the prototype version of the instrument consisting of 58 items grouped into two parts: Part A (impact/HRQoL \u2013 34 items) and Part B (signs and symptoms \u2013 24 items). The initial testing showed intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of >0.8 for both Part A and Part B. Item rating for language clarity, completeness, relevance, and response scale by experts and patients showed content validity index for scales average >0.8 for both Part A and Part B, except 0.64 for relevance for Part A by the patient panel. The final testing of the revised version of the instrument showed the Cronbach\u2019s alpha value of 0.91 for Part A and 0.76 for Part B, suggesting high internal consistency, and ICC of 0.91 for Part A and 0.76 for Part B. The recall period of \u201ctoday\u201d for Part-A and \u201clast 3 days\u201d for Part-B were the patients\u2019 preferred \u201crecall period.\u201d Furthermore, the patients expressed preference to the HM-PRO items as statements. Conclusion: The findings of this study confirm that the HM-PRO possesses a strong content validity, includes all the issues important to patients and is easy to read, understand and respond to spontaneously.", "AuthorKeywords": ["clinical practice", "clinical research", "content validity", "hematological malignancy", "HM-PRO", "quality of life", "symptoms"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082678241", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57206190194": {"Name": "Goswami P.", "AuthorID": "57206190194", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "School of Life and Medical Sciences, University of Hertfordshire"}, "7004158096": {"Name": "Salek S.", "AuthorID": "7004158096", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "School of Life and Medical Sciences, University of Hertfordshire"}, "7005455337": {"Name": "Oliva E.N.", "AuthorID": "7005455337", "AffiliationID": "118786469", "AffiliationName": "Haematology Unit, Grande Ospedale Metropolitano"}, "6603354617": {"Name": "Ionova T.", "AuthorID": "6603354617", "AffiliationID": "60031888", "AffiliationName": "St. Petersburg State University Medical Center and Multinational Centre for Quality of Life Research"}, "57208740646": {"Name": "Else R.", "AuthorID": "57208740646", "AffiliationID": "122536137", "AffiliationName": "Patient Research Partner"}, "18040106100": {"Name": "Kell J.", "AuthorID": "18040106100", "AffiliationID": "60138351", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff and Vale University Health Board"}, "7102396522": {"Name": "Fielding A.K.", "AuthorID": "7102396522", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57208747134": {"Name": "Jennings D.M.", "AuthorID": "57208747134", "AffiliationID": "60013102", "AffiliationName": "Royal Surrey NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6602145526": {"Name": "Karakantza M.", "AuthorID": "6602145526", "AffiliationID": "60012508", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "57208736018": {"Name": "McConnell S.", "AuthorID": "57208736018", "AffiliationID": "60012508", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "57208746029": {"Name": "Langton C.", "AuthorID": "57208746029", "AffiliationID": "60012508", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "6701332628": {"Name": "Al-Ismail S.", "AuthorID": "6701332628", "AffiliationID": "60025217, 60138360", "AffiliationName": "Singleton Hospital, ABM University Health Board"}, "23024396800": {"Name": "Collins G.P.", "AuthorID": "23024396800", "AffiliationID": "60170323", "AffiliationName": "Oxford University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
