The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..The small-scale mirror mode excited by electron dynamics is a fundamental physical process, attracting research interest in space, laboratory, and astrophysical plasma physics over the past half century. However, the investigations of this process were mostly limited to theories and numerical simulations, with no direct observational evidence for their existence. In this study we present clear observations of electron mirror-mode using Magnetospheric Multiscale data at unprecedented high temporal cadence. These structures are train-like, compressible, nonpropagating, and satisfy the theoretical excitation and electron trapping conditions. They were observed near the Earth's foreshock and its downstream turbulence during the corotating interaction region events, which could be involved with the interaction between solar wind and Earth.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072557046", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"56706781900": {"Name": "Yao S.", "AuthorID": "56706781900", "AffiliationID": "60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Space Weather, National Space Science Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "13605264100": {"Name": "Shi Q.", "AuthorID": "13605264100", "AffiliationID": "60108071", "AffiliationName": "Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Optical Astronomy and Solar-Terrestrial Environment, Institute of Space Sciences, Shandong University"}, "6603982437": {"Name": "Degeling A.", "AuthorID": "6603982437", "AffiliationID": "60108071", "AffiliationName": "Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Optical Astronomy and Solar-Terrestrial Environment, Institute of Space Sciences, Shandong University"}, "57203262368": {"Name": "Tian A.", "AuthorID": "57203262368", "AffiliationID": "60108071", "AffiliationName": "Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Optical Astronomy and Solar-Terrestrial Environment, Institute of Space Sciences, Shandong University"}, "55851738800": {"Name": "Liu J.", "AuthorID": "55851738800", "AffiliationID": "60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Space Weather, National Space Science Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "57197843335": {"Name": "Yao Z.", "AuthorID": "57197843335", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Physique Atmosph\u00e9rique et Plan\u00e9taire, STAR Institute, Universit\u00e9 de Liege"}, "7003431703": {"Name": "Rae I.", "AuthorID": "7003431703", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Physique Atmosph\u00e9rique et Plan\u00e9taire, STAR Institute, Universit\u00e9 de Liege"}, "55317746800": {"Name": "Guo R.", "AuthorID": "55317746800", "AffiliationID": "60019499, 60109828", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Earth and Planetary Physics, Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "7006197877": {"Name": "Zong Q.", "AuthorID": "7006197877", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Space Sciences, Peking University"}, "15738252200": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "15738252200", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Space Sciences, Peking University"}, "56490422400": {"Name": "Wang X.", "AuthorID": "56490422400", "AffiliationID": "60019616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Harbin Institute of Technology"}, "57203513298": {"Name": "Russell C.", "AuthorID": "57203513298", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth, Planetary and Space Sciences, University of California"}, "57192488120": {"Name": "Zhang H.", "AuthorID": "57192488120", "AffiliationID": "60011976", "AffiliationName": "Physics Department and Geophysical Institute, University of Alaska Fairbanks"}, "7404097125": {"Name": "Hu H.", "AuthorID": "7404097125", "AffiliationID": "60002033, 60102714", "AffiliationName": "SOA Key Laboratory for Polar Science, Polar Research Institute of China"}, "57209191851": {"Name": "Li B.", "AuthorID": "57209191851", "AffiliationID": "60029306", "AffiliationName": "Chinese Antarctic Center of Surveying and Mapping, Wuhan University"}, "7006512935": {"Name": "Giles B.", "AuthorID": "7006512935", "AffiliationID": "60006337", "AffiliationName": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center"}}}
