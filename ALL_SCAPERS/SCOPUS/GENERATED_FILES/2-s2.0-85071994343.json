The sensitive period for risk exposure and extent that risk is mediated through amyloid or vascular-related mechanisms are poorly understood. We aimed to identify if, and when, blood pressure or change in blood pressure during adulthood were associated with late-life brain structure, pathology, and cognition. Methods: Participants were from Insight 46, a neuroscience substudy of the ongoing longitudinal Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development, a birth cohort that initially comprised 5362 individuals born throughout mainland Britain in one week in 1946. Participants aged 69\u201371 years received T1 and FLAIR volumetric MRI, florbetapir amyloid-PET imaging, and cognitive assessment at University College London (London, UK); all participants were dementia-free. Blood pressure measurements had been collected at ages 36, 43, 53, 60\u201364, and 69 years. We also calculated blood pressure change variables between ages. Primary outcome measures were white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV) quantified from multimodal MRI using an automated method, amyloid-\u03b2 positivity or negativity using a standardised uptake value ratio approach, whole-brain and hippocampal volumes quantified from 3D-T1 MRI, and a composite cognitive score\u2014the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC). We investigated associations between blood pressure and blood pressure changes at and between 36, 43, 53, 60\u201364, and 69 years of age with WMHV using generalised linear models with a gamma distribution and log link function, amyloid-\u03b2 status using logistic regression, whole-brain volume and hippocampal volumes using linear regression, and PACC score using linear regression, with adjustment for potential confounders. Findings: Between May 28, 2015, and Jan 10, 2018, 502 individuals were assessed as part of Insight 46. 465 participants (238 [51%] men; mean age 70\u00b77 years [SD 0\u00b77]; 83 [18%] amyloid-\u03b2-positive) were included in imaging analyses. Higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) at age 53 years and greater increases in SBP and DBP between 43 and 53 years were positively associated with WMHV at 69\u201371 years of age (increase in mean WMHV per 10 mm Hg greater SBP 7%, 95% CI 1\u201314, p=0\u00b7024; increase in mean WMHV per 10 mm Hg greater DBP 15%, 4\u201327, p=0\u00b70057; increase in mean WMHV per one SD change in SBP 15%, 3\u201329, p=0\u00b7012; increase in mean WMHV per 1 SD change in DBP 15%, 3\u201330, p=0\u00b7017). Higher DBP at 43 years of age was associated with smaller whole-brain volume at 69\u201371 years of age (\u22126\u00b79 mL per 10 mm Hg greater DBP, \u221211\u00b79 to \u22121\u00b79, p=0\u00b70068), as were greater increases in DBP between 36 and 43 years of age (\u22126\u00b75 mL per 1 SD change, \u221211\u00b71 to \u22121\u00b79, p=0\u00b70054). Greater increases in SBP between 36 and 43 years of age were associated with smaller hippocampal volumes at 69\u201371 years of age (\u22120\u00b703 mL per 1 SD change, \u22120\u00b706 to \u22120\u00b7001, p=0\u00b7043). Neither absolute blood pressure nor change in blood pressure predicted amyloid-\u03b2 status or PACC score at 69\u201371 years of age. Interpretation: High and increasing blood pressure from early adulthood into midlife seems to be associated with increased WMHV and smaller brain volumes at 69\u201371 years of age. We found no evidence that blood pressure affected cognition or cerebral amyloid-\u03b2 load at this age. Blood pressure monitoring and interventions might need to start around 40 years of age to maximise late-life brain health.
