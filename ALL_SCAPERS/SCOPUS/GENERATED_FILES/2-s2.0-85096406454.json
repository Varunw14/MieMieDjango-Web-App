Methods: An online search using three different search terms regarding the treatment of the mouth in SSc was undertaken using the Google search engine. The first 100 websites from each search were selected for analysis. Data recorded included DISCERN instrument scores along with the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) benchmarks and the presence of the Health on the Net seal (HON). Flesch Reading Ease Scores, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, the Simplified Measure of Gobbledygook Index and Coleman-Liau index were calculated to assess readability. Results: Fifty seven of the first websites remained for analysis after applying appropriate exclusion criteria. The mean overall DISCERN score was 2.37 (\u00b11.01). Only 4 websites (7%) achieved all four JAMA benchmarks. Only 12 websites (21.1%) displayed the HON seal. The reading level was found to be difficult to very difficult among the majority of websites. Conclusion: The overall quality of the available online information concerning the treatment of the mouth of systemic sclerosis is questionable and requires a high level of reading skill. Further efforts should be directed toward establishing higher quality, reliable online information sources on the treatment of oral disease relevant to patients with systemic sclerosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Online information", "Patient education", "Systemic sclerosis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096406454", "SubjectAreas": [["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"]], "AuthorData": {"57217735678": {"Name": "Abdouh I.", "AuthorID": "57217735678", "AffiliationID": "60008920", "AffiliationName": "Oral Medicine, College of Dentistry, Taibah University"}, "7201730425": {"Name": "Porter S.", "AuthorID": "7201730425", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Oral Medicine, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "7004087651": {"Name": "Fedele S.", "AuthorID": "7004087651", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Oral Theme UCLH/UCL NIHR, Biomedical Research Centre"}, "8266665000": {"Name": "Ni Riordain R.", "AuthorID": "8266665000", "AffiliationID": "60002199, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Cork University Dental School and Hospital, University College Cork"}, "57219980908": {"Name": "Elgendy N.", "AuthorID": "57219980908", "AffiliationID": "60004582", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Dentistry, King Abdulaziz University"}}}
