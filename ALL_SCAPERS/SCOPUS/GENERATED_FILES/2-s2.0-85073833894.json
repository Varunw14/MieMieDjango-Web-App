The two best-performing CTFs are based on benzonitrile and dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone linkers, respectively, with catalytic activities that are among the highest for this material class. The activities of the different CTFs are rationalized in terms of four variables: the predicted electron affinity, the predicted ionization potential, the optical gap, and the dispersibility of the CTFs particles in solution, as measured by optical transmittance. The electron affinity and dispersibility in solution are found to be the best predictors of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Benzonitriles", "Covalent triazine-based frameworks", "Dispersibilities", "High throughput", "Hydrogen evolution", "Optical gap", "Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution", "Suzuki-Miyaura"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073833894", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57205955397": {"Name": "Meier C.", "AuthorID": "57205955397", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool"}, "23491285200": {"Name": "Clowes R.", "AuthorID": "23491285200", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool"}, "36657600800": {"Name": "Sprick R.", "AuthorID": "36657600800", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool"}, "7401832651": {"Name": "Cooper A.", "AuthorID": "7401832651", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool"}, "6507121537": {"Name": "Zwijnenburg M.", "AuthorID": "6507121537", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55697801800": {"Name": "Berardo E.", "AuthorID": "55697801800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Molecular Sciences Research Hub, Imperial College London, White City Campus"}, "22834892900": {"Name": "Jelfs K.", "AuthorID": "22834892900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Molecular Sciences Research Hub, Imperial College London, White City Campus"}}}
