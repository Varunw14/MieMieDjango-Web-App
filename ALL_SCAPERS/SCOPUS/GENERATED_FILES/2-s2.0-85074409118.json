All rights reserved.Seawater intrusion into the Pombas River, source of freshwater to Praia de Leste on the coast of Parana in Brazil presents a problem to the water utility as most water treatment plants in Brazil are conventional. To find a solution to this problem, a pilot plant (1 m3 /h) consisting of ultrafiltration (UF) followed by reverse osmosis (RO) was developed and evaluated. For testing, brackish water was produced with a concentration of 1,500 \u00b1 100 mg/L of total dissolved solids (TDS), mixing seawater and fresh water. To evaluate the water quality, TDS, electrical conductivity, pH, temperature, apparent color, turbidity, alkalinity, total hardness, calcium, chloride and sulfate were monitored. For operational performance, flowrates, osmotic pressure, filtration rate, recovery rate and mass balance were analyzed. On average, the UF system removed 96.4% of turbidity and 98.6% of apparent color; whereas the RO system removed 99.4% of TDS. The overall average recovery (UF and RO) was 45.81% with average osmotic pressure of 8.21 bar, filtration rate of 30.7 L/h/m2 in the UF system and 21.7 L/h/m2 in the RO system. From a water quality point of view, the system was effective in processing brackish into fresh water of high quality.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brackish water", "Desalination", "Reverse osmosis", "Ultrafiltration"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074409118", "SubjectAreas": [["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"], ["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"]], "AuthorData": {"56088518300": {"Name": "Wiecheteck G.", "AuthorID": "56088518300", "AffiliationID": "60018034", "AffiliationName": "State University of Ponta Grossa"}, "35389950100": {"Name": "Szeliga M.", "AuthorID": "35389950100", "AffiliationID": "60018034", "AffiliationName": "State University of Ponta Grossa"}, "57211552007": {"Name": "Bovaroti T.", "AuthorID": "57211552007", "AffiliationID": "60018034", "AffiliationName": "State University of Ponta Grossa"}, "57211562555": {"Name": "Rodrigues A.", "AuthorID": "57211562555", "AffiliationID": "60018034", "AffiliationName": "State University of Ponta Grossa"}, "57211561701": {"Name": "de Almeida J.", "AuthorID": "57211561701", "AffiliationID": "60018034", "AffiliationName": "State University of Ponta Grossa"}, "35784465100": {"Name": "Kummer A.", "AuthorID": "35784465100", "AffiliationID": "60018034", "AffiliationName": "State University of Ponta Grossa"}, "14043273200": {"Name": "Campos L.", "AuthorID": "14043273200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57211551134": {"Name": "Carranza G.", "AuthorID": "57211551134", "AffiliationID": "60015161", "AffiliationName": "University of Louisiana at Lafayette"}, "7006282106": {"Name": "Acevedo M.", "AuthorID": "7006282106", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "University of North Texas"}, "57211559963": {"Name": "de Souza M.", "AuthorID": "57211559963", "AffiliationID": "114704891", "AffiliationName": "Water and Sanitation Company of Parana State"}}}
