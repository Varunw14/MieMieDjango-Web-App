Adopting an input distribution from the LUXqed formulation, we discuss our methods of including QED effects for the full, coupled DGLAP evolution of all partons with QED at O(\u03b1) , O(\u03b1\u03b1S) , O(\u03b12). While we find consistency for the photon PDF of the proton with other recent sets, building on this we also present a set of QED corrected neutron PDFs and provide the photon PDF separated into its elastic and inelastic contributions. The effect of QED corrections on the other partons and the fit quality is investigated, and the sources of uncertainty for the photon are outlined. Finally we explore the phenomenological implications of this set, giving the partonic luminosities for both the elastic and inelastic contributions to the photon and the effect of our photon PDF on fits to high mass Drell\u2013Yan production, including the photon-initiated channel.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073258934", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (miscellaneous)", "ENGI", "2201"], ["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"35589760900": {"Name": "Harland-Lang L.A.", "AuthorID": "35589760900", "AffiliationID": "122238246", "AffiliationName": "Rudolf Peierls Centre"}, "7404932388": {"Name": "Martin A.D.", "AuthorID": "7404932388", "AffiliationID": "60022175, 60176038", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Particle Physics Phenomenology, University of Durham"}, "56960541900": {"Name": "Nathvani R.", "AuthorID": "56960541900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7101652961": {"Name": "Thorne R.S.", "AuthorID": "7101652961", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
