Physiological Reports published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of The Physiological Society and the American Physiological SocietyNeonatal monitoring in neonatal intensive care is pushing the technological boundaries of newborn brain monitoring in order to improve patient outcome. There is an urgent need of a cot side, real time monitoring for assessment of brain injury severity and neurodevelopmental outcome, in particular for term newborn infants with hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. This topical review discusses why brain tissue metabolic monitoring is important in this group of infants and introduces the currently used neuromonitoring techniques for metabolic monitoring in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). New optical techniques that can monitor changes in brain metabolism together with brain hemodynamics at the cot side are presented. Early studies from these emerging technologies have demonstrated their potential to deliver continuous information regarding cerebral physiological changes in sick newborn infants in real time. The promises of these new tools as well as their potential limitations are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biomarkers", "cerebral metabolism", "intensive care medicine", "near-infrared spectroscopy", "neonatal medicine", "optical monitoring"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090511336", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"56321585100": {"Name": "Bale G.", "AuthorID": "56321585100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "6507301690": {"Name": "Tachtsidis I.", "AuthorID": "6507301690", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "21135277300": {"Name": "Mitra S.", "AuthorID": "21135277300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neonatology, EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}}}
