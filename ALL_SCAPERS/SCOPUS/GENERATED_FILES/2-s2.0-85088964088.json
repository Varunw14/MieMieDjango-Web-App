The most common alterations are KIAA1549:BRAF fusions and BRAFV600E and NF1 mutations. Novel drugs targeting the MAPK pathway (MAPKi) are prime candidates for the treatment of these single-pathway diseases. We aimed to develop an assay suitable for preclinical testing of MAPKi in pLGGs with the goal to identify novel MAPK pathway\u2013suppressing synergistic drug combinations. A reporter plasmid (pDIPZ) with a MAPK-responsive ELK-1\u2013binding element driving the expression of destabilized firefly luciferase was generated and packaged using a lentiviral vector system. Pediatric glioma cell lines with a BRAF fusion (DKFZ-BT66) and a BRAFV600E mutation (BT-40) background, respectively, were stably transfected. Modulation of the MAPK pathway activity by MAPKi was measured using the luciferase reporter and validated by detection of phosphorylated protein levels. A screening of a MAPKi library was performed, and synergy of selected combinations was calculated. Screening of a MAPKi library revealed MEK inhibitors as the class inhibiting the pathway with the lowest IC50s, followed by ERK and next-generation RAF inhibitors. Combination treatments with different MAPKi classes showed synergistic effects in BRAF fusion as well as BRAFV600E mutation backgrounds. Here, we report a novel reporter assay for medium-to high-throughput preclinical drug testing in pLGG cell lines. The assay confirmed MEK, ERK, and next-generation RAF inhibitors as potential treatment approaches for KIAA1549:BRAF and BRAFV600E-mutated pLGGs. In addition, the assay revealed that combination treatments synergistically suppressed MAPK pathway activity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal",
