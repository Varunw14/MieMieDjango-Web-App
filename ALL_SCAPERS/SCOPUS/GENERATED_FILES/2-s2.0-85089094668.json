Methods in Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British Ecological SocietyBiologists often seek to geographically provenance organisms using their traits. This is typically achieved by defining spatial groups using distinct patterns of trait variation. Here, we present a new spatial provenancing and trait boundary identification methodology, based on correlations between geographic and trait distances that require no a priori group assumptions. We apply this to three datasets where spatial provenance is sought: morphological rat and vole dentition data (human commensal translocation datasets); and birdsong data (cultural transmission dataset). We also present the results of cross-validation testing. Spatial provenancing is possible with differing degrees of accuracy for each dataset, with birdsong providing the most accurate geographic origin (identifying an average spatial region of 0.22 km2 as the area of origin with 99.9% confidence). Our method has a wide range of potential applications to diverse data types\u2014including phenotypic, genetic and cultural\u2014to identify trait boundaries and spatially provenance the origin of unknown or translocated specimens where trait differences are geographically structured and correlated with spatial separation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biogeography", "identification", "morphology", "phylogeography", "provenancing", "spatial mapping", "trait mapping"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089094668", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Ecological Modeling", "ENVI", "2302"]], "AuthorData": {"36627224600": {"Name": "Hulme-Beaman A.", "AuthorID": "36627224600", "AffiliationID": "60028355", "AffiliationName": "Research Centre in Evolutionary Anthropology and Palaeoecology, School of Natural Sciences and Psychology, Liverpool John Moores University"}, "6602595568": {"Name": "Dobney K.", "AuthorID": "6602595568", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "School of Philosophical and Historical Inquiry, University of Sydney"}, "56142164700": {"Name": "Rudzinski A.", "AuthorID": "56142164700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "8606206600": {"Name": "Thomas M.G.", "AuthorID": "8606206600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Genetics Institute, University College London"}, "57203534521": {"Name": "Cooper J.E.J.", "AuthorID": "57203534521", "AffiliationID": "60016777", "AffiliationName": "British Trust for Ornithology, The Nunnery"}, "6603569329": {"Name": "Lachlan R.F.", "AuthorID": "6603569329", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway University of London"}}}
