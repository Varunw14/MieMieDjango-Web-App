Yet, the level of psychosocial functioning is rarely directly asked of young people themselves, despite the widespread recognition that the young person\u2019s perspective is valuable and is often at odds with those of other reporters, such as parents or professionals. One possible reason for this is that the field lacks a clear agreed tool to capture this information in a non-burdensome way. To begin to address this gap, this paper describes psychometric analysis of the Child Outcome Rating Scale (CORS), a brief and highly accessible self-report measure of young people\u2019s psychosocial functioning already used extensively by mental health professionals around the world but with only limited data on psychometric robustness. Using large community (n = 7822) and clinic (n = 2604) samples, we explore the factor structure, construct validity, internal consistency, differential item functioning, and sensitivity of the CORS. We found that the CORS stands up to psychometric scrutiny, having found satisfactory levels of reliability, validity, and sensitivity in this sample. We also found that the CORS is suitable for use with young people as old as 15 years old. That the CORS has been found to be psychometrically robust while being highly feasible (brief, simple, easy to administer) for use in busy clinical settings, combined with the fact that the CORS has already been widely adopted by clinicians and young people, suggests CORS may be an important tool for international use.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adolescence", "Functioning", "Mental health", "Outcome", "Psycho-social", "Wellbeing", "Young people"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Pilot Projects", "Psychometrics", "Public Health", "Reproducibility of Results", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074722442", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"37010837000": {"Name": "Casey P.", "AuthorID": "37010837000", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Evidence Based Practice Unit (EBPU), UCL and Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}, "41861122100": {"Name": "Deighton J.", "AuthorID": "41861122100", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Evidence Based Practice Unit (EBPU), UCL and Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}, "6701596440": {"Name": "Wolpert M.", "AuthorID": "6701596440", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Evidence Based Practice Unit (EBPU), UCL and Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}, "55746318400": {"Name": "Patalay P.", "AuthorID": "55746318400", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60015879, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Longitudinal Studies and MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, UCL"}, "57213258668": {"Name": "Miller S.D.", "AuthorID": "57213258668", "AffiliationID": "109208479", "AffiliationName": "International Center for Clinical Excellence"}}}
