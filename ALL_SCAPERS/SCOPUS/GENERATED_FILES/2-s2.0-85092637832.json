These peoples\u2019 \u201cinstinctive\u201d parenting behaviour forms the basis for AP\u2019s seven tools, including breastfeeding, babywearing and bedsharing. As the AP phenomenon gathers momentum in the US, UK and Canada, this paper examines the raced, gendered and classed dimensions of its rise to popularity. Who is AP for? And to whom does it belong?
