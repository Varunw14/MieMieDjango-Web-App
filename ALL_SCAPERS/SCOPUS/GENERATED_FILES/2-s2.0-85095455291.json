We tested this hypothesis in humans by monitoring sub-second striatal dopamine and serotonin signaling during a visual motion discrimination task that separates sensory uncertainty from decision difficulty in a factorial design. Caudate nucleus recordings (n = 4) revealed multi-scale encoding: in three participants, serotonin tracked sensory uncertainty, and, in one participant, both dopamine and serotonin tracked deviations from expected trial transitions within our factorial design. Putamen recordings (n = 1) supported a cognition-action separation between caudate nucleus and putamen\u2014a striatal sub-division unique to primates\u2014with both dopamine and serotonin tracking decision times. These first-of-their-kind observations in the human brain reveal a role for sub-second dopamine and serotonin signaling in non-reward-based aspects of cognition and action.\u00a9 2020 The Author(s)Dopamine and serotonin have traditionally been linked to reward processing. Bang, Kishida et al. show in the human brain that these neuromodulators also play a role in non-reward-based aspects of cognition and behavior, including rapid perceptual decision processes and action.", "AuthorKeywords": ["action", "cognition", "decision-making", "dopamine", "fast scan cyclic voltammetry", "human", "neuromodulation", "perception", "serotonin", "striatum"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095455291", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"55179035900": {"Name": "Bang D.", "AuthorID": "55179035900", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford"}, "35068005100": {"Name": "Fleming S.M.", "AuthorID": "35068005100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60122566", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research, University College London"}, "7004572764": {"Name": "Montague P.R.", "AuthorID": "7004572764", "AffiliationID": "60027090", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Virginia Tech"}, "8573193100": {"Name": "Kishida K.T.", "AuthorID": "8573193100", "AffiliationID": "60031437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Wake Forest School of Medicine"}, "6506866017": {"Name": "Laxton A.W.", "AuthorID": "6506866017", "AffiliationID": "60031437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Wake Forest School of Medicine"}, "36721249300": {"Name": "Tatter S.B.", "AuthorID": "36721249300", "AffiliationID": "60031437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Wake Forest School of Medicine"}, "6506984553": {"Name": "Lohrenz T.", "AuthorID": "6506984553", "AffiliationID": "60027090", "AffiliationName": "Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC, Virginia Tech"}, "55937307500": {"Name": "White J.P.", "AuthorID": "55937307500", "AffiliationID": "60027090", "AffiliationName": "Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC, Virginia Tech"}}}
