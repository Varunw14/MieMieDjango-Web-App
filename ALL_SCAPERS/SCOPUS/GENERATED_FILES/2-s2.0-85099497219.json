This exploratory study examined the role of the indoor home environment on two components of self-regulation: emotional dysregulation and independence. We used growth curve modelling to explore the trajectories of self-regulation among 13,774 children from the Millennium Cohort Study, followed at ages three, five and seven years. Disorganisation, quiet and calm were related to both components of self-regulation. Additionally, damp, second-hand smoke and TV noise predicted emotional dysregulation. Our other measures of the home environment (overcrowding, home traffic, presence of open fires and garden access) were unrelated to self-regulation. Our results suggest that the atmosphere and maintenance of the home may directly impact self-regulation in early and middle childhood.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Emotional dysregulation", "Home environment", "Independence", "Longitudinal birth cohort", "Millennium cohort study", "Self-regulation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85099497219", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"57221589041": {"Name": "Oloye H.T.", "AuthorID": "57221589041", "AffiliationID": "60011326", "AffiliationName": "UCL Ear Institute"}, "7003573629": {"Name": "Flouri E.", "AuthorID": "7003573629", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Human Development, UCL Institute of Education"}}}
