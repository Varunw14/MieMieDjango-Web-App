Fifty percent of HSP patients remain yet genetically undiagnosed. The 100,000 Genomes Project (100KGP) is a large UK-wide initiative to provide genetic diagnosis to previously undiagnosed patients and families with rare conditions. Over 400 HSP families were recruited to the 100KGP. In order to obtain genetic diagnoses, gene-based burden testing was carried out for rare, predicted pathogenic variants using candidate variants from the Exomiser analysis of the genome sequencing data. A significant gene-disease association was identified for UBAP1 and HSP. Three protein truncating variants were identified in 13 patients from 7 families. All patients presented with juvenile form of pure HSP, with median age at onset 10 years, showing autosomal dominant inheritance or de novo occurrence. Additional clinical features included parkinsonism and learning difficulties, but their association with UBAP1 needs to be established.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091009365", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"57196355245": {"Name": "Bourinaris T.", "AuthorID": "57196355245", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuromuscular Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57219011678": {"Name": "Sheikh I.", "AuthorID": "57219011678", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuromuscular Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57215213195": {"Name": "Athanasiou-Fragkouli A.", "AuthorID": "57215213195", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuromuscular Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "16033551800": {"Name": "Vandrovcova J.", "AuthorID": "16033551800", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuromuscular Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7003363686": {"Name": "Houlden H.", "AuthorID": "7003363686", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuromuscular Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57207566844": {"Name": "Smedley D.", "AuthorID": "57207566844", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "23007919800": {"Name": "Cipriani V.", "AuthorID": "23007919800", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "36189161300": {"Name": "Tucci A.", "AuthorID": "36189161300", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "9533655500": {"Name": "Chinnery P.", "AuthorID": "9533655500", "AffiliationID": "60000368, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Mitochondrial Biology Unit, University of Cambridge, Cambridge Biomedical Campus"}, "7401534782": {"Name": "Morris H.", "AuthorID": "7401534782", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55218539800": {"Name": "Real R.", "AuthorID": "55218539800", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57212629714": {"Name": "Wood N.", "AuthorID": "57212629714", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "36716386200": {"Name": "Harrison V.", "AuthorID": "36716386200", "AffiliationID": "60002967", "AffiliationName": "Wessex Clinical Genetics Service, Princess Anne Hospital"}, "57203258242": {"Name": "Reid E.", "AuthorID": "57203258242", "AffiliationID": "60103296, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Genetics and Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
