The efficiency of this process relies on the effectiveness of the electrocatalysts used. The electro-kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is highly pH dependent and conventional catalysts typically are expensive and rare platinum-based materials. The development of low-cost, multi-component electrocatalysts, where each of the components has a synergistic effect, can be an effective approach to improve kinetics. Herein, a series of transition metal (Fe, Mn, Co, and Ni)-modified molybdenum carbides in a nitrogen-doped carbon matrix (TM-Mo2C@NCF) are synthesised to maximise exposed active sites. Among them, Fe-Mo2C@NCF delivers the best-in-class HER performance over a wide range of electrolytes. Tafel slopes of 76, 109 and 110 mV dec\u22121and overpotentials of 65, 130 and 129 mV at 10 mA cm\u22122were obtained in 1.0 M KOH, 1.0 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS) and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively. The computational study further indicates that the synergistic electronic modulation co-activated by Fe and N dopants in Fe-Mo2C@NCF can reduce the Gibbs free energy of H adsorption (\u0394GH*) and render the Mo-Mo bridge site the most energetically favorable adsorption site for the H* intermediate, which contributes to an increased HER performance.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Computational studies", "Conventional catalyst", "Effective approaches", "Molybdenum carbide", "Nitrogen-doped carbons", "Phosphate buffer solutions", "Series of transition", "Synergistic effect"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092437209", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"56135575800": {"Name": "Huang J.", "AuthorID": "56135575800", "AffiliationID": "60018554", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Engineering, Zhengzhou University"}, "57219374923": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "57219374923", "AffiliationID": "60018554", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Engineering, Zhengzhou University"}, "36618476500": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "36618476500", "AffiliationID": "60018554", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Engineering, Zhengzhou University"}, "55626024600": {"Name": "He G.", "AuthorID": "55626024600", "AffiliationID": "60026830", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Lincoln, Joseph Banks Laboratories"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.R.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.J.L.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57190226198": {"Name": "Tian Z.", "AuthorID": "57190226198", "AffiliationID": "60018554, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Materials Processing and Mold (Zhengzhou University), Ministry of Education, National Engineering Research Center for Advanced Polymer Processing Technology, Zhengzhou University"}, "8319000700": {"Name": "Liu C.", "AuthorID": "8319000700", "AffiliationID": "60018554, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Materials Processing and Mold (Zhengzhou University), Ministry of Education, National Engineering Research Center for Advanced Polymer Processing Technology, Zhengzhou University"}, "57218358027": {"Name": "Liu T.", "AuthorID": "57218358027", "AffiliationID": "60018554, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Materials Processing and Mold (Zhengzhou University), Ministry of Education, National Engineering Research Center for Advanced Polymer Processing Technology, Zhengzhou University"}, "57193773684": {"Name": "Xie R.", "AuthorID": "57193773684", "AffiliationID": "60073523, 60002246, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Structural Chemistry, Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)"}, "55161802400": {"Name": "Chai G.", "AuthorID": "55161802400", "AffiliationID": "60073523, 60002246, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Structural Chemistry, Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)"}, "56688138200": {"Name": "Lai F.", "AuthorID": "56688138200", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, KU Leuven"}}}
