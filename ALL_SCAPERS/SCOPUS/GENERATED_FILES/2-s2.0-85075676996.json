Re-use permitted under CC BY. Published by BMJ.Background: Refugees have different experiences of obtaining a refugee status, however it remains unclear if this affects their risk of psychiatric disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate whether risk for non-affective psychotic disorder (NAPD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) differs between quota refugees (resettled from refugee camps) and non-quota refugees (former asylum seekers). Method: A register-based cohort with a sample size of 52 561 refugees in Sweden starting 1 January 1997 ending 31 December 2011. Exposure: refugee status (quota or non-quota refugees). Cox regression models estimated adjusted HRs with 95% CIs for NAPD (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), F20-29) and PTSD (ICD-10, F43.1) by refugee status. Results: There were more non-quota refugees (77.0%) than quota refugees (23.0%). In total we identified 401 cases of NAPD, 1.0% among quota refugees and 0.7% among non-quota refugees, and 1070 cases of PTSD, 1.9% among quota refugees and 2.1% among non-quota refugees. Male quota refugees were at increased risk for NAPD compared with male non-quota refugees (HRmale=1.41, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.82 and HRfemale=0.65, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.00). All quota refugees were at a reduced risk of PTSD compared with non-quota refugees (HR=0.74, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.87). Conclusions: This study suggests that risk of NAPD and PTSD varies for quota and non-quota refugees, highlighting the possibility that different experiences of the migration process differentiate the risk of psychiatric disorders among refugees.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cohort studies", "migration", "psychiatry", "public health", "record linkage"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cohort Studies", "Emigration and Immigration", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Psychotic Disorders", "Public Health", "Refugees", "Retrospective Studies", "Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic", "Sweden", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075676996", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57212002903": {"Name": "Duggal A.K.", "AuthorID": "57212002903", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health Sciences, Karolinska Institute"}, "23394868300": {"Name": "Hollander A.C.", "AuthorID": "23394868300", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health Sciences, Karolinska Institute"}, "57218240440": {"Name": "Kirkbride J.B.", "AuthorID": "57218240440", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, UCL"}, "6701846593": {"Name": "Dalman C.", "AuthorID": "6701846593", "AffiliationID": "121520246", "AffiliationName": "Psykisk H\u00e4lsa, Centrum f\u00fcr Epidemiologi Och Samh\u00e4llsmedicin"}}}
