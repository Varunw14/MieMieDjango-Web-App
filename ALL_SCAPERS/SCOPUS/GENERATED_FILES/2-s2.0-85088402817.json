British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British Pharmacological SocietyAims: The aim of this study was to investigate the initial cardiovascular prescription patterns in patients after their first cardiovascular events, and to identify factors associated with cardiovascular polypharmacy. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study including patients aged \u2265 45 years with the first record of coronary heart disease (CHD) or stroke between 2007 and 2016 using The Health Improvement Network database. This study investigated the patterns of cardiovascular drugs prescribed during the first 90 days after the first cardiovascular events. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between patients' baseline characteristics and cardiovascular polypharmacy (\u22655 cardiovascular drugs). Results: A total of 121,600 (59,843 CHD and 61,757 stroke) patients were included in the study. The mean age was 69.5 \u00b1 11.9 years. The proportion of patients who were prescribed 0\u20131, 2\u20133, 4\u20135 drugs and \u22656 drugs were 11.0%, 29.8%, 38.6% and 20.5%, respectively. Factors associated with cardiovascular polypharmacy were sex (female: OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.72\u20130.76 vs male), age (75\u201384 years old: OR 0.50, 0.47\u20130.53 vs 45\u201354 years old), smoking status (current smoking: OR 1.29, 1.15\u20131.24 vs never), body mass index (obesity: OR 1.38, 1.34\u20131.43 vs normal), deprivation status (most deprived: OR 1.09, 1.04\u20131.14 vs least deprived) and Charlson comorbidity index (index \u22655: OR 1.25, 1.16\u20131.35 vs index 0). Conclusion: Multiple cardiovascular drugs treatment was common in patients with CVD in the UK. High-risk factors of CVD were also associated with cardiovascular polypharmacy. Further studies are warranted to assess the impact of cardiovascular polypharmacy and its interaction on CVD recurrence and mortality.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cardiovascular drugs", "coronary heart disease", "polypharmacy", "stroke"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088402817", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57205465881": {"Name": "Ma T.T.", "AuthorID": "57205465881", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Practice and Policy, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "7102513915": {"Name": "Wong I.C.K.", "AuthorID": "7102513915", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong"}, "6507777030": {"Name": "Whittlesea C.", "AuthorID": "6507777030", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Practice and Policy, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "55883514900": {"Name": "Man K.K.C.", "AuthorID": "55883514900", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Practice and Policy, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "55499786000": {"Name": "Lau W.", "AuthorID": "55499786000", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Practice and Policy, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "54384760200": {"Name": "Brauer R.", "AuthorID": "54384760200", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Practice and Policy, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "8448863300": {"Name": "Wei L.", "AuthorID": "8448863300", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Practice and Policy, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "56250129400": {"Name": "Mackenzie I.S.", "AuthorID": "56250129400", "AffiliationID": "60008877", "AffiliationName": "Medicines Monitoring Unit (MEMO Research) and Hypertension Research Centre, University of Dundee"}}}
