We compared a new hyperoncotic priming solution containing dextran 40, which has an electrolyte composition that mimics extracellular fluid, with a standard crystalloid-based prime. Methods: Eighty cardiac surgery patients were included in this double-blind, randomized, single-center study. Patients were randomized to either a dextran-based prime or a crystalloid prime containing Ringer's acetate and mannitol. The primary end point was colloid oncotic pressure in serum during CPB. Secondary end points included fluid balance, bleeding and transfusion requirements, pulmonary function, hemolysis, systemic inflammation, and markers of renal, hepatic, myocardial, and brain injury. Blood samples were collected before, during, and after CPB. Results: Colloid oncotic pressure was higher in the dextran group than in the crystalloid prime group during CPB (18.8 \u00b1 2.9 versus 16.4 \u00b1 2.9 mm Hg; P <.001) and 10 minutes after CPB (19.2 \u00b1 2.7 versus 16.8 \u00b1 2.9 mm Hg; P <.001). Patients in the dextran group required less intravenous fluid during CPB (1090 \u00b1 499 versus 1437 \u00b1 543 mL; P =.004) and net fluid balance was less positive 12 hours after surgery (1431 \u00b1 741 versus 1901 \u00b1 922 mL; P =.014). Plasma-free hemoglobin was significantly lower in the dextran group 2 hours after CPB (0.18 \u00b1 0.11 versus 0.41 \u00b1 0.33; P =.001). There were no significant differences in bleeding, transfusion requirements, organ function, systemic inflammation, or brain and myocardial injury markers between groups at any time point. Conclusions: Our results suggest that a hyperoncotic dextran-based priming solution preserves intraoperative colloid oncotic pressure compared with crystalloid prime. Larger studies with clinically valid end points are necessary to evaluate hyperoncotic prime solutions further.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Cardiopulmonary Bypass", "Crystalloid Solutions", "Dextrans", "Double-Blind Method", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pilot Projects", "Prospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092789156", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57188992848": {"Name": "Barbu M.", "AuthorID": "57188992848", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "6603890023": {"Name": "Dellgren G.", "AuthorID": "6603890023", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "7005509590": {"Name": "Jeppsson A.", "AuthorID": "7005509590", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "6506903814": {"Name": "Kolsrud O.", "AuthorID": "6506903814", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "14120771100": {"Name": "Bj\u00f6rk K.", "AuthorID": "14120771100", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "55356867000": {"Name": "Hansson C.", "AuthorID": "55356867000", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "7004882547": {"Name": "Ricksten S.E.", "AuthorID": "7004882547", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, Institute of Clinical Sciences, University of Gothenburg"}, "36879827000": {"Name": "Thor\u00e9n A.", "AuthorID": "36879827000", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiothoracic Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "57208899083": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "57208899083", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "7101909602": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "7101909602", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}}}
