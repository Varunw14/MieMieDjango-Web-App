Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.The biocompatibility and neuron regenerating properties of various bioactive glass (BG)/polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) blend composites were assessed in order to study their suitability for peripheral nerve tissue applications, specifically as lumen structures for nerve guidance conduits. BG/PHA blend composites were fabricated using Bioactive glass\u00ae 45 S5 (BG1) and BG 1393 (BG2) with the 25:75 poly(3-hydroxyoctanoate/poly3-hydroxybutyrate), 25:75 P(3HO)/P(3HB) blend (PHA blend). Various concentrations of each BG (0.5 wt%, 1.0 wt% and 2.5 wt%) were used to determine the effect of BG on neuronal growth and differentiation, in single culture using NG108-15 neuronal cells and in a co-culture along with RN22 Schwann cells. NG108-15 cells exhibited good growth and differentiation on all the PHA blend composites showing that both BGs have good biocompatibility at 0.5 wt%, 1.0 wt% and 2.5 wt% within the PHA blend. The Young's modulus values displayed by all the PHA blend/BG composites ranged from 385.6 MPa to 1792.6 MPa, which are able to provide the required support and protective effect for the regeneration of peripheral nerves. More specifically, the tensile strength obtained in the PHA blend/BG1 (1.0 wt%) (10.0 0.6 MPa) was found to be similar to that of the rabbit peroneal nerve. This composite also exhibited the best biological performance in supporting growth and neuronal differentiation among all the substrates. The neurite extension on this composite was found to be remarkable with the neurites forming a complex connection network.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biological performance", "Complex connections", "Composite scaffolds", "Neurite extension", "Neuronal differentiation", "Peripheral nerves", "Polyhydroxyalkanoates", "Protective effects"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087470022", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"56712825700": {"Name": "Lizarraga-Valderrama L.R.", "AuthorID": "56712825700", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Sciences, Medical School, University of Nottingham"}, "7006385493": {"Name": "Nigmatullin R.", "AuthorID": "7006385493", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Composites Institute (ACCIS), University of Bristol"}, "57217663623": {"Name": "Ladino B.", "AuthorID": "57217663623", "AffiliationID": "60000508", "AffiliationName": "Applied Biotechnology Research Group, School of Life Sciences, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, University of Westminster"}, "57213789119": {"Name": "Roy I.", "AuthorID": "57213789119", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Sheffield"}, "56543899300": {"Name": "Taylor C.S.", "AuthorID": "56543899300", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Sheffield"}, "55987061100": {"Name": "Claeyssens F.", "AuthorID": "55987061100", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Sheffield"}, "35237001100": {"Name": "Haycock J.W.", "AuthorID": "35237001100", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Sheffield"}, "55937239600": {"Name": "Boccaccini A.R.", "AuthorID": "55937239600", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg"}, "26643634100": {"Name": "Knowles J.C.", "AuthorID": "26643634100", "AffiliationID": "60002877", "AffiliationName": "UCL Eastman-Korea Dental Medicine Innovation Centre, Dankook University"}}}
