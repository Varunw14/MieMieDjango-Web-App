The two competing explanations aiming to explain its origin range from a new distinct crystalline phase of ice to deep-glassy states of the well-known ice VI. Problems with the slow kinetics of deuterated phases have been raised, which we circumvent here entirely by simultaneously measuring the inelastic neutron spectra and neutron diffraction data of H2O samples. These measurements support the deep-glassy ice VI scenario and rule out alternative explanations. Additionally, we show that the crystallographic model of D2O ice XV, the ordered counterpart of ice VI, also applies to the corresponding H2O phase. The discovery of deep-glassy ice VI now provides a fascinating new example of ultrastable glasses that are encountered across a wide range of other materials.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Crystalline phase", "Crystallographic models", "Glassy state", "Inelastic neutrons", "Low-temperature endotherms", "Neutron diffraction data", "Neutron spectroscopy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079079072", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"55308126000": {"Name": "Rosu-Finsen A.", "AuthorID": "55308126000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57200285630": {"Name": "Amon A.", "AuthorID": "57200285630", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7004272333": {"Name": "Salzmann C.G.", "AuthorID": "7004272333", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7403155598": {"Name": "Armstrong J.", "AuthorID": "7403155598", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Pulsed Neutron and Muon Source, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "55924594300": {"Name": "Fernandez-Alonso F.", "AuthorID": "55924594300", "AffiliationID": "60104285", "AffiliationName": "IKERBASQUE, Basque Foundation for Science"}}}
