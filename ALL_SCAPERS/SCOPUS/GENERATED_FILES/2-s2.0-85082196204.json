This uncertainty of the polymeric approach in tissue engineering launches an opportunity to address a key question: can we eliminate the disadvantages of both natural and synthetic polymers by combining them to form a synergistic relationship? To answer this question, we fabricated scaffolds from elastin, collagen, fibrin, and electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) with different ratios. The material characterization of these scaffolds investigated degradation, water contact angle, angiogenesis by an ex ovo chorion allantoic membrane (CAM) assay, and mechanical and structural properties. Biological activity and specific differentiation pathways (MSC, adipogenic, osteogenic, myogenic, and chondrogenic) were studied by using human adipose-derived stem cells. Results indicated that all composite polymers degraded at a different rate, thus affecting their mechanical integrity. Cell-based assays demonstrated continual proliferative and viable properties of the cells on all seeded scaffolds with the particular initiation of a differentiation pathway among which the PCL/collagen/fibrin composite was the most angiogenic material with maximum vasculature. We were able to tailor the physical and biological properties of PCL-based composites to form a synergistic relationship for various tissue regeneration applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biomaterials", "mesenchymal stem cells", "polymers", "regenerative medicine", "tissue engineering", "tissue regeneration"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biological properties", "Clinical application", "Human adipose derived stem cells", "Material characterizations", "Mechanical integrity", "Mesenchymal stem cell", "Synthetic polymers", "Water contact angle", "Allantois", "Animals", "Biocompatible Materials", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell Survival", "Chick Embryo", "Chorion", "Collagen", "Elastin", "Fibrin", "Humans", "Mesenchymal Stem Cells", "Neovascularization, Physiologic", "Polyesters", "Polymers", "Tissue Engineering", "Tissue Scaffolds"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082196204", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"56209158300": {"Name": "Sawadkar P.", "AuthorID": "56209158300", "AffiliationID": "60006776", "AffiliationName": "Regenerative Biomaterials Group, RAFT Institute, Mount Vernon Hospital"}, "57215875510": {"Name": "Mohanakrishnan J.", "AuthorID": "57215875510", "AffiliationID": "60006776", "AffiliationName": "Regenerative Biomaterials Group, RAFT Institute, Mount Vernon Hospital"}, "57191580990": {"Name": "Kohli N.", "AuthorID": "57191580990", "AffiliationID": "60006776", "AffiliationName": "Regenerative Biomaterials Group, RAFT Institute, Mount Vernon Hospital"}, "55375422500": {"Name": "Garc\u00eda-Gareta E.", "AuthorID": "55375422500", "AffiliationID": "60006776", "AffiliationName": "Regenerative Biomaterials Group, RAFT Institute, Mount Vernon Hospital"}, "57215873994": {"Name": "Rajasekar P.", "AuthorID": "57215873994", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Division of Respiratory Medicine, University of Nottingham"}, "54965481500": {"Name": "Rahmani B.", "AuthorID": "54965481500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "6602787947": {"Name": "Bozec L.", "AuthorID": "6602787947", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Dentistry, University of Toronto"}}}
