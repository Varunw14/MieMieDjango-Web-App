Methods: Analysing data from the Scottish Community Engagement Trial of procedurally just policing, we use natural effect modelling for causally ordered mediators to assess causal pathways that include\u2014but also extend beyond\u2014the experimental treatment to procedural justice. Results: Normative and non-normative forms of obligation are empirically distinct. Normative obligation to obey the police is sensitive to procedurally just or unjust police behaviour, and influences cooperation with the police and traffic law compliance in a way that is consistent with procedural justice theory. Non-normative obligation to obey the police is \u2018sticky\u2019 and unresponsive. Conclusions: Legitimacy can resonably be defined partly as normative obligation with its expected beneficial downstream effects, so long as it is measured properly.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Causal mediation analysis", "Cooperation", "Measurement", "Obligation to obey the police", "Police legitimacy", "Procedural justice", "Sense of power"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084325543", "SubjectAreas": [["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"57205764426": {"Name": "P\u00f3sch K.", "AuthorID": "57205764426", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "Department of Methodology, London School of Economics"}, "7404117113": {"Name": "Jackson J.", "AuthorID": "7404117113", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "Department of Methodology, London School of Economics and University of Sydney Law School"}, "30367516400": {"Name": "Bradford B.", "AuthorID": "30367516400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}, "55099028800": {"Name": "Macqueen S.", "AuthorID": "55099028800", "AffiliationID": "60119152", "AffiliationName": "Scottish Government"}}}
