The transition to the Neolithic in Arabia occurred during this period of climatic amelioration. Various forms of stone structures are abundant in northern Arabia, and it has been speculated that some of these dated to the Neolithic, but there has been little research on their character and chronology. Here we report a study of 104 \u2018mustatil\u2019 stone structures from the southern margins of the Nefud Desert in northern Arabia. We provide the first chronometric age estimate for this type of structure \u2013 a radiocarbon date of ca. 5000 BC \u2013 and describe their landscape positions, architecture and associated material culture and faunal remains. The structure we have dated is the oldest large-scale stone structure known from the Arabian Peninsula. The mustatil phenomenon represents a remarkable development of monumental architecture, as hundreds of these structures were built in northwest Arabia. This \u2018monumental landscape\u2019 represents one of the earliest large-scale forms of monumental stone structure construction anywhere in the world. Further research is needed to understand the function of these structures, but we hypothesise that they were related to rituals in the context of the adoption of pastoralism and resulting territoriality in the challenging environments of northern Arabia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["archaeology", "climate change", "human-environment interaction", "Neolithic", "pastoralism", "territoriality"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088539602", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"], ["Paleontology", "EART", "1911"]], "AuthorData": {"37120127600": {"Name": "Groucutt H.S.", "AuthorID": "37120127600", "AffiliationID": "60020318", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry"}, "57200073549": {"Name": "Stewart M.", "AuthorID": "57200073549", "AffiliationID": "60020318", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry"}, "56254820000": {"Name": "Guagnin M.", "AuthorID": "56254820000", "AffiliationID": "60108650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology, Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History"}, "7003671891": {"Name": "Petraglia M.D.", "AuthorID": "7003671891", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Social Science, The University of Queensland"}, "55496453700": {"Name": "Breeze P.S.", "AuthorID": "55496453700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, Kings College London"}, "7003403258": {"Name": "Drake N.", "AuthorID": "7003403258", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, Kings College London"}, "24778858900": {"Name": "Shipton C.", "AuthorID": "24778858900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "57201494613": {"Name": "Zahrani B.", "AuthorID": "57201494613", "AffiliationID": "112626065", "AffiliationName": "Ministry of Tourism of Saudi Arabia"}, "57218549706": {"Name": "Omarfi A.A.", "AuthorID": "57218549706", "AffiliationID": "112626065", "AffiliationName": "Ministry of Tourism of Saudi Arabia"}, "6504770701": {"Name": "Alsharekh A.M.", "AuthorID": "6504770701", "AffiliationID": "60013183", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology, College of Tourism and Archaeology, King Saudi University"}}}
