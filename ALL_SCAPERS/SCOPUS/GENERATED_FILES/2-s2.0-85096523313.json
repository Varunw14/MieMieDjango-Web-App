All rights reserved.Objective We set out to determine which characteristics and outcomes of stroke are associated with COVID-19. Methods This case-control study included patients admitted with stroke to 13 hospitals in England and Scotland between 9th March and 5th July 2020. We collected data on86strokes (81 ischaemic strokes and 5intracerebral haemorrhages)in patients withevidence of COVID-19 at the time of stroke onset (Cases). They were compared with 1384strokes(1193 ischaemic strokes and 191 intracerebral haemorrhages) in patients admitted during the same time periodwho never had evidence of COVID-19 (Controls). In addition the whole group of stroke admissions, including another 37 in patients who appear to have developed COVID-19 after their stroke, were included in two logistic regression analyses examining which features wereindependently associated with COVID-19 status and with inpatient mortality. Results Cases with ischaemic stroke were more likely than ischaemic controls to occur in Asians (18.8% vs 6.7%, p0.0002), were more likely to involve multiple large vessel occlusions (17 9% vs 8.1%, p0 03), were more severe (median NIHSS 8 vs 5, p0 002), were associated with higher D-dimer levels (p0 01) and were associated withmore severe disability on discharge (median mRS 4 vs 3, p0 0001) and inpatientdeath (19.8% vs9 6%, p0 0001). Recurrence of stroke during the patient s admission was rare in Cases and Controls (2.3% vs1.0%, NS). Conclusions Our data suggest that COVID-19 may be an important modifier of the onset, characteristics and outcome of acute ischaemic stroke.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096523313", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57207047985": {"Name": "Perry R.J.", "AuthorID": "57207047985", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Comprehensive Stroke Service, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCL Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603142203": {"Name": "Simister R.J.", "AuthorID": "6603142203", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Comprehensive Stroke Service, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCL Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603707621": {"Name": "Werring D.J.", "AuthorID": "6603707621", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Comprehensive Stroke Service, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCL Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57195463991": {"Name": "Banaras A.", "AuthorID": "57195463991", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Comprehensive Stroke Service, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCL Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56941112700": {"Name": "Smith C.J.", "AuthorID": "56941112700", "AffiliationID": "60008873", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Centre for Clinical Neurosciences, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603757999": {"Name": "Roffe C.", "AuthorID": "6603757999", "AffiliationID": "60004563", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Service, University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust"}, "57219293982": {"Name": "Padmanabhan N.", "AuthorID": "57219293982", "AffiliationID": "60030210", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Keele University"}, "57192295378": {"Name": "Ferdinand P.", "AuthorID": "57192295378", "AffiliationID": "60004563", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Service, University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust"}, "57220027463": {"Name": "Narayanamoorthi S.", "AuthorID": "57220027463", "AffiliationID": "60009274", "AffiliationName": "Department of Stroke Medicine, Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "57220028869": {"Name": "Marigold R.", "AuthorID": "57220028869", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Stroke Medicine, University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6602317625": {"Name": "Willmot M.", "AuthorID": "6602317625", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57220024247": {"Name": "Ahmed U.", "AuthorID": "57220024247", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "A complete list of the SETICOS collaborators is given in the Supplementary Materials"}, "55290684200": {"Name": "Dixit A.", "AuthorID": "55290684200", "AffiliationID": "60001239", "AffiliationName": "Department of Stroke Medicine, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7402686940": {"Name": "Hassan A.", "AuthorID": "7402686940", "AffiliationID": "60012508", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "57215649458": {"Name": "Quinn T.", "AuthorID": "57215649458", "AffiliationID": "60018058", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Service, Glasgow Royal Infirmary"}, "56916094600": {"Name": "Mcgrane F.", "AuthorID": "56916094600", "AffiliationID": "60018058", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Service, Glasgow Royal Infirmary"}, "35767416800": {"Name": "Ankolekar S.", "AuthorID": "35767416800", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "50263815900": {"Name": "Zhang L.", "AuthorID": "50263815900", "AffiliationID": "60032542", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, St George's University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55618655500": {"Name": "Banerjee S.", "AuthorID": "55618655500", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Centre, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57192941846": {"Name": "Marks I.H.", "AuthorID": "57192941846", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Centre, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
