These functional nanocomposites exhibit tunable absorption in the near-infrared region with relatively high photothermal efficiencies. More importantly, their potential for bio-imaging and therapeutic treatment is proven by cellular uptake and cytotoxicity studies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cellular uptake", "Functional nanocomposites", "Near infrared region", "Phosphorylcholine", "Photothermal conversion efficiencies", "Polyaniline nanocomposites", "Scalable synthesis", "Therapeutic treatments"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085264113", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"15063332400": {"Name": "Ruiz-P\u00e9rez L.", "AuthorID": "15063332400", "AffiliationID": "120502137", "AffiliationName": "EPSRC, JEOL Centre for Liquid Electron Microscopy"}, "26644315100": {"Name": "Rizzello L.", "AuthorID": "26644315100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57204254218": {"Name": "Battaglia G.", "AuthorID": "57204254218", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "53164480500": {"Name": "Pei Y.", "AuthorID": "53164480500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56231357600": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "56231357600", "AffiliationID": "60019533", "AffiliationName": "Tianjin Key Laboratory of Drug Delivery and High-Efficiency, School of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Tianjin University"}, "57188677175": {"Name": "Li N.", "AuthorID": "57188677175", "AffiliationID": "60019533", "AffiliationName": "Tianjin Key Laboratory of Drug Delivery and High-Efficiency, School of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Tianjin University"}}}
