All rights reserved.China s fossil-fuel CO2 (FFCO2) emissions accounted for approximately 28% of the global total FFCO2 in 2016. An accurate estimate of China s FFCO2 emissions is a prerequisite for global and regional carbon budget analyses and the monitoring of carbon emission reduction efforts. However, significant uncertainties and discrepancies exist in estimations of China s FFCO2 emissions due to a lack of detailed traceable emission factors (EFs) and multiple statistical data sources. Here, we evaluated China s FFCO2 emissions from nine published global and regional emission datasets. These datasets show that the total emissions increased from 3.4 (3.0 3.7) in 2000 to 9.8 (9.2 10.4) Gt CO2 yr-1 in 2016. The variations in these estimates were largely due to the different EF (0.491 0.746 t C per t of coal) and activity data. The large-scale patterns of gridded emissions showed a reasonable agreement, with high emissions being concentrated in major city clusters, and the standard deviation mostly ranged from 10% to 40% at the provincial level. However, patterns beyond the provincial scale varied significantly, with the top 5% of the grid level accounting for 50 % 90% of total emissions in these datasets. Our findings highlight the significance of using locally measured EF for Chinese coal. To reduce uncertainty, we recommend using physical CO2 measurements and use these values for dataset validation, key input data sharing (e.g., point sources), and finer-resolution validations at various levels.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85093860249", "SubjectAreas": [["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"]], "AuthorData": {"56443372100": {"Name": "Han P.", "AuthorID": "56443372100", "AffiliationID": "60016211, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Numerical Modeling for Atmospheric Sciences and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "7004390586": {"Name": "Zeng N.", "AuthorID": "7004390586", "AffiliationID": "60020304", "AffiliationName": "Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Science and Earth System Science Interdisciplinary Center, University of Maryland"}, "7403316747": {"Name": "Oda T.", "AuthorID": "7403316747", "AffiliationID": "60002442", "AffiliationName": "Goddard Earth Sciences Research and Technology, Universities Space Research Association"}, "57194419927": {"Name": "Lin X.", "AuthorID": "57194419927", "AffiliationID": "60016211, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Boundary Layer Physics and Atmospheric Chemistry, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "55714199800": {"Name": "Wu L.", "AuthorID": "55714199800", "AffiliationID": "60016211, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Boundary Layer Physics and Atmospheric Chemistry, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "37099552800": {"Name": "Crippa M.", "AuthorID": "37099552800", "AffiliationID": "60103695", "AffiliationName": "European Commission, Joint Research Centre (JRC, Directorate for Energy, Transport and Climate, Air and Climate Unit"}, "55932047300": {"Name": "Janssens-Maenhout G.", "AuthorID": "55932047300", "AffiliationID": "60103695", "AffiliationName": "European Commission, Joint Research Centre (JRC, Directorate for Energy, Transport and Climate, Air and Climate Unit"}, "15839411900": {"Name": "Guan D.", "AuthorID": "15839411900", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "Water Security Research Centre, School of International Development, University of East Anglia"}, "57196426525": {"Name": "Liu Z.", "AuthorID": "57196426525", "AffiliationID": "60000112, 60122652", "AffiliationName": "Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, School of International Development, University of East Anglia"}, "57203955829": {"Name": "Ma X.", "AuthorID": "57203955829", "AffiliationID": "60033100", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse, School of the Environment, Nanjing University"}, "15764137000": {"Name": "Wang H.", "AuthorID": "15764137000", "AffiliationID": "60033100", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse, School of the Environment, Nanjing University"}, "56015318000": {"Name": "Shan Y.", "AuthorID": "56015318000", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "Energy and Sustainability Research Institute Groningen, University of Groningen"}, "57218664100": {"Name": "Tao S.", "AuthorID": "57218664100", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Earth Surface Processes, College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Peking University"}, "7405338650": {"Name": "Wang R.", "AuthorID": "7405338650", "AffiliationID": "60009860", "AffiliationName": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Fudan University"}, "57193629831": {"Name": "Yun X.", "AuthorID": "57193629831", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Earth Surface Processes, College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Peking University"}, "55625202144": {"Name": "Zhang Q.", "AuthorID": "55625202144", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Earth System Modeling, Department of Earth System Science, Tsinghua University"}, "55823446500": {"Name": "Zhao F.", "AuthorID": "55823446500", "AffiliationID": "60021200, 60130184", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Geographic Information Science (Ministry of Education), School of Geographic Sciences, East China Normal University"}, "35792776400": {"Name": "Zheng B.", "AuthorID": "35792776400", "AffiliationID": "60029937, 60045588, 60008134, 60007816", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l'Environnement, CEA-CNRS-UVSQ, UMR8212"}}}
