Surprisingly, analogous studies involving metal oxide semiconductors are relatively scarce. Here, spray-deposited In2O3 layers are employed as the model semiconductor system to study the impact of layer thickness on quantum confinement and electron transport along the transistor channel. The results reveal an exponential increase of the in-plane electron mobility (\u00b5e) with increasing In2O3 thickness up to \u224810 nm, beyond which it plateaus at a maximum value of \u224835 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121. Optical spectroscopy measurements performed on In2O3 layers reveal the emergence of quantum confinement for thickness <10 nm, which coincides with the thickness that \u00b5e starts deteriorating. By combining two- and four-probe field-effect mobility measurements with high-resolution atomic force microscopy, it is shown that the reduction in \u00b5e is attributed primarily to surface scattering. The study provides important guidelines for the design of next generation metal oxide thin-film transistors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["indium oxide", "quantum confinement", "spray pyrolysis", "surface roughness scattering", "thin-film transistors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Exponential increase", "Metal oxide semiconductor", "Metal oxide thin-film transistors", "Optical spectroscopy", "Semiconductor channels", "Semiconductor systems", "Solution-processed", "Transistor channels"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092057763", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"]], "AuthorData": {"55551834500": {"Name": "Isakov I.", "AuthorID": "55551834500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Centre for Plastic Electronics, Blackett Laboratory, Imperial College London"}, "57056020500": {"Name": "Mottram A.D.", "AuthorID": "57056020500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Centre for Plastic Electronics, Blackett Laboratory, Imperial College London"}, "57202083228": {"Name": "Das S.", "AuthorID": "57202083228", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Centre for Plastic Electronics, Blackett Laboratory, Imperial College London"}, "57193883089": {"Name": "Grell M.", "AuthorID": "57193883089", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Centre for Plastic Electronics, Blackett Laboratory, Imperial College London"}, "6701337286": {"Name": "Anthopoulos T.D.", "AuthorID": "6701337286", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), KAUST Solar Center and Physical Science and Engineering Division (PSE)"}, "54882406000": {"Name": "Regoutz A.", "AuthorID": "54882406000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London, 20 Gordon Street"}, "57188995841": {"Name": "Kilmurray R.", "AuthorID": "57188995841", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Royal School of Mines, Imperial College London"}, "7005745335": {"Name": "McLachlan M.A.", "AuthorID": "7005745335", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Royal School of Mines, Imperial College London"}, "56785104500": {"Name": "Payne D.J.", "AuthorID": "56785104500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Royal School of Mines, Imperial College London"}, "33567624500": {"Name": "Faber H.", "AuthorID": "33567624500", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), KAUST Solar Center and Physical Science and Engineering Division (PSE)"}}}
