Published by Oxford University Press in association with The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.There is some evidence that female sex workers (FSWs) receive greater earnings for providing unprotected sex. In 2003, the landscape of the fight against HIV/AIDS dramatically changed in India with the introduction of Avahan, the largest HIV prevention programme implemented globally. Using a unique, cross-sectional bio-behavioural dataset from 3591 FSWs located in the four Indian states where Avahan was implemented, we estimate the economic loss faced by FSWs who always use condoms. We estimate the causal effect of condom use on the price charged during the last paid sexual intercourse using the random targeting of Avahan as an instrumental variable. Results indicate that FSWs who always use condoms face an income loss of 65% (INR125, US$2.60) per sex act compared to peers providing unprotected sex, consistent with our expectations. The main finding confirms that clients have a preference for unprotected sex and that policies aiming at changing clients' preferences and at improving the bargaining power of FSWs are required to limit the spread of HIV.", "AuthorKeywords": ["compensating differential", "condom use", "HIV prevention", "India", "instrumental variables", "sex work"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Commerce", "Condoms", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "India", "Safe Sex", "Sex Workers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076583627", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"]], "AuthorData": {"57076299300": {"Name": "Quaife M.", "AuthorID": "57076299300", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health and Development, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "55537012400": {"Name": "L\u00e9pine A.", "AuthorID": "55537012400", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health and Development, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "8966189200": {"Name": "Terris-Prestholt F.", "AuthorID": "8966189200", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health and Development, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "35309309500": {"Name": "Beattie T.", "AuthorID": "35309309500", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health and Development, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "6505889496": {"Name": "Vickerman P.", "AuthorID": "6505889496", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "24385527800": {"Name": "Deering K.", "AuthorID": "24385527800", "AffiliationID": "60015670, 60026960", "AffiliationName": "Gender and Sexual Health Initiative, BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, St. Paul's Hospital"}, "26023279500": {"Name": "Isac S.", "AuthorID": "26023279500", "AffiliationID": "60009697", "AffiliationName": "Department of Community Health Sciences, Center for Global Public Health, University of Manitoba"}, "7003434156": {"Name": "Paranjape R.S.", "AuthorID": "7003434156", "AffiliationID": "60002107", "AffiliationName": "National AIDS Research Institute"}}}
