By performing scaled outdoor measurements in summer of 2017 in Guangzhou, China, we investigate these impacts on spatial/temporal characteristics of urban thermal environment which are still unclear so far. Two types of street canyon models are investigated, i.e. the \u2018hollow\u2019 model resembling hollow concrete buildings and the \u2018sand\u2019 model consisting of buildings filled with sand attaining much greater thermal storage. For each model, three street aspect ratios (building height/street width, H/W = 1, 2, 3; H = 1.2 m) are considered. The diurnal variations of air-wall surface temperatures are observed and their characteristics are quantified for various cases. The daily average temperature and daily temperature range (DTR) of wall temperature vary significantly with different aspect ratios and thermal storage. During the daytime, wider street canyon (H/W = 1) with less shading area experiences higher temperature than narrower ones (H/W = 2, 3) as more solar radiation received by wall surfaces. At night, wider street canyon cools down quicker due to stronger upward longwave radiation and night ventilation. For hollow models, H/W = 1 attains DTR of 12.1 \u00b0C, which is 1.2 and 2.1 \u00b0C larger than that of H/W = 2, 3. Moreover, the sand models experience smaller DTR and a less changing rate of wall temperature than hollow models because larger thermal storage absorbs more heat in the daytime and releases more at night. DTR of hollow models with H/W = 1, 2, 3 is 4.5, 4.6 and 3.8 \u00b0C greater than sand models respectively. For both hollow and sand models, wider streets experience a little higher daily average temperature (0.3\u20130.6 \u00b0C) than narrower ones. Our study provides direct evidence in how man-made urban structures influence urban climate and also suggests the possibility to control outdoor thermal environment by optimize urban morphology and thermal storage.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aspect ratio", "Daily temperature cycle", "Daily temperature range (DTR)", "Scaled outdoor measurement of urban climate and health (SOMUCH)", "Street canyon", "Thermal storage"], "IndexKeywords": ["Daily temperature ranges", "Diurnal variation", "Long-wave radiation", "Outdoor measurements", "Outdoor thermal environment", "Thermal environment", "Urban thermal environment", "Wall surface temperature"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083338717", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Waste Management and Disposal", "ENVI", "2311"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"]], "AuthorData": {"57204562192": {"Name": "Chen G.", "AuthorID": "57204562192", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "School of Atmospheric Sciences, Guangdong Province Key Laboratory for Climate Change and Natural Disaster Studies, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "57202943797": {"Name": "Wang D.", "AuthorID": "57202943797", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "School of Atmospheric Sciences, Guangdong Province Key Laboratory for Climate Change and Natural Disaster Studies, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "35240092500": {"Name": "Hang J.", "AuthorID": "35240092500", "AffiliationID": "60021182, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Atmosphere-Ocean System (Sun Yat-sen University), Ministry of Education"}, "56428398600": {"Name": "Gao P.", "AuthorID": "56428398600", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "School of Atmospheric Sciences, Guangdong Province Key Laboratory for Climate Change and Natural Disaster Studies, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "55260298100": {"Name": "Ou C.", "AuthorID": "55260298100", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "School of Atmospheric Sciences, Guangdong Province Key Laboratory for Climate Change and Natural Disaster Studies, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "56547809000": {"Name": "Wang Q.", "AuthorID": "56547809000", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, the University of Hong Kong"}, "57204521929": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "57204521929", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, the University of Hong Kong"}, "55547129784": {"Name": "Wang K.", "AuthorID": "55547129784", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, the University of Hong Kong"}, "57197788881": {"Name": "Wang X.", "AuthorID": "57197788881", "AffiliationID": "60017456", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Environmental and Climate Research, Jinan University"}}}
