However, the term a \u20ac lockdown' is not well-defined. Indeed, WHO's reference to a \u20ac so-called lockdown measures' indicates the absence of a clear and universally accepted definition of the term a \u20ac lockdown'. We propose a definition of a \u20ac lockdown' based on a two-by-two matrix that categorises different communicable disease measures based on whether they are compulsory or voluntary; and whether they are targeted at identifiable individuals or facilities, or whether they are applied indiscriminately to a general population or area. Using this definition, we describe the design, timing and implementation of lockdown measures in nine countries in sub-Saharan Africa: Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. While there were some commonalities in the implementation of lockdown across these countries, a more notable finding was the variation in the design, timing and implementation of lockdown measures. We also found that the number of reported cases is heavily dependent on the number of tests carried out, and that testing rates ranged from 2031 to 63 928 per million population up until 7 September 2020. The reported number of COVID-19 deaths per million population also varies (0.4 to 250 up until 7 September 2020), but is generally low when compared with countries in Europe and North America. While lockdown measures may have helped inhibit community transmission, the pattern and nature of the epidemic remains unclear. However, there are signs of lockdown harming health by affecting the functioning of the health system and causing social and economic disruption.", "AuthorKeywords": ["SARS"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85093956060", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"55205099300": {"Name": "Haider N.", "AuthorID": "55205099300", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Pathobiology and Population Science, Royal Veterinary College"}, "57214653249": {"Name": "Osman A.Y.", "AuthorID": "57214653249", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Pathobiology and Population Science, Royal Veterinary College"}, "57202637161": {"Name": "Kock R.", "AuthorID": "57202637161", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Pathobiology and Population Science, Royal Veterinary College"}, "9436713000": {"Name": "Gadzekpo A.", "AuthorID": "9436713000", "AffiliationID": "60017910", "AffiliationName": "Department of Communication Studies, University of Ghana"}, "57216901024": {"Name": "Akipede G.O.", "AuthorID": "57216901024", "AffiliationID": "60017037", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine, Ambrose Alli University"}, "8927884000": {"Name": "Asogun D.", "AuthorID": "8927884000", "AffiliationID": "105816653", "AffiliationName": "Community Medicine, Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital"}, "36599955100": {"Name": "Ansumana R.", "AuthorID": "36599955100", "AffiliationID": "125265877", "AffiliationName": "Mercy Hospital Research Laboratory"}, "57203045192": {"Name": "Lessells R.J.", "AuthorID": "57203045192", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pubic Health, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "53982851600": {"Name": "Khan P.", "AuthorID": "53982851600", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57216815886": {"Name": "Hamid M.M.A.", "AuthorID": "57216815886", "AffiliationID": "60071726, 60071723", "AffiliationName": "Department of Parasitology and Medical Entomology, Institute of Endemic Diseases, University of Khartoum"}, "14036737200": {"Name": "Yeboah-Manu D.", "AuthorID": "14036737200", "AffiliationID": "60017910", "AffiliationName": "Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research, University of Ghana"}, "6603636153": {"Name": "Mboera L.", "AuthorID": "6603636153", "AffiliationID": "60071594", "AffiliationName": "Sacids Foundation for One Health, Sokoine University of Agricultue"}, "23981602100": {"Name": "Shayo E.H.", "AuthorID": "23981602100", "AffiliationID": "60071565", "AffiliationName": "Department of Policy Analysis and Advocacy, National Institute for Medical Research"}, "34873186100": {"Name": "Mmbaga B.T.", "AuthorID": "34873186100", "AffiliationID": "60138788", "AffiliationName": "Kilimanjaro Clinical Research Institute"}, "6602814685": {"Name": "Urassa M.", "AuthorID": "6602814685", "AffiliationID": "60071592", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Medical Research Mwanza Research Centre"}, "6507364045": {"Name": "Musoke D.", "AuthorID": "6507364045", "AffiliationID": "60196602", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Health, Makerere University College of Health Sciences"}, "23992930000": {"Name": "Kapata N.", "AuthorID": "23992930000", "AffiliationID": "60072803", "AffiliationName": "Ministry of Health"}, "57219564848": {"Name": "Kapata P.C.", "AuthorID": "57219564848", "AffiliationID": "60072803", "AffiliationName": "Ministry of Health"}, "14218935700": {"Name": "Ferrand R.A.", "AuthorID": "14218935700", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57209404402": {"Name": "Stigler F.", "AuthorID": "57209404402", "AffiliationID": "101812942", "AffiliationName": "Austrian Sickness Fund"}, "35603068700": {"Name": "Czypionka T.", "AuthorID": "35603068700", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "Health Policy London, School of Economics and Political Science"}, "57216109256": {"Name": "Zumla A.", "AuthorID": "57216109256", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Microbiology, University College London"}, "16245595100": {"Name": "McCoy D.", "AuthorID": "16245595100", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Population Health Sciences, Barts and London Medical and Dental School, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
