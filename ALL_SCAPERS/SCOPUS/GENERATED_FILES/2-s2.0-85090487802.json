In doing so, they become experts over their narrow area of research. However, ambitious scientific projects, such as the search for gravitational waves, require them to come together and collaborate across disciplinary borders. How should scientists with expertise in different disciplines treat each others\u2019 expert claims? An intuitive answer is that the collaboration should defer to the opinions of experts. In this paper we show that under certain seemingly innocuous assumptions, this intuitive answer gives rise to an impossibility result when it comes to aggregating the beliefs of experts to deliver the beliefs of a collaboration as a whole. We then argue that when experts\u2019 beliefs come into conflict, they should waive their expert status.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Collaboration in science", "Judgement aggregation", "Scientific rationality", "Social epistemology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090487802", "SubjectAreas": [["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["History and Philosophy of Science", "ARTS", "1207"]], "AuthorData": {"57189932956": {"Name": "Marcoci A.", "AuthorID": "57189932956", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Philosophy of Natural and Social Science, London School of Economics and Political Science"}, "57186211800": {"Name": "Nguyen J.", "AuthorID": "57186211800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Philosophy, University College London"}}}
