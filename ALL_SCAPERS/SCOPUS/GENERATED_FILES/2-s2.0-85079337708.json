Mart\u00ednez Corrales et al. show that reducing the activity of this polymerase, even only in subsets of adult cells, can promote broad health benefits and longevity in the animal model Drosophila melanogaster.\u00a9 2020 The Author(s)Health and survival in old age can be improved by changes in gene expression. RNA polymerase (Pol) I is the essential, conserved enzyme whose task is to generate the pre-ribosomal RNA (rRNA). We find that reducing the levels of Pol I activity is sufficient to extend lifespan in the fruit fly. This effect can be recapitulated by partial, adult-restricted inhibition, with both enterocytes and stem cells of the adult midgut emerging as important cell types. In stem cells, Pol I appears to act in the same longevity pathway as Pol III, implicating rRNA synthesis in these cells as the key lifespan determinant. Importantly, reduction in Pol I activity delays broad, age-related impairment and pathology, improving the function of diverse organ systems. Hence, our study shows that Pol I activity in the adult drives systemic, age-related decline in animal health and anticipates mortality.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aging", "Drosophila", "lifespan", "longevity", "old-age health", "ribosomal RNA/DNA", "RNA polymerase I"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079337708", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"56543613700": {"Name": "Mart\u00ednez Corrales G.", "AuthorID": "56543613700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Healthy Ageing and the Research Department of Genetics, Evolution, and Environment, University College London"}, "57199649706": {"Name": "Filer D.", "AuthorID": "57199649706", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Healthy Ageing and the Research Department of Genetics, Evolution, and Environment, University College London"}, "57214867108": {"Name": "Wenz K.C.", "AuthorID": "57214867108", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Healthy Ageing and the Research Department of Genetics, Evolution, and Environment, University College London"}, "57214866976": {"Name": "Rogan A.", "AuthorID": "57214866976", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Healthy Ageing and the Research Department of Genetics, Evolution, and Environment, University College London"}, "57194379349": {"Name": "Phillips G.", "AuthorID": "57194379349", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Healthy Ageing and the Research Department of Genetics, Evolution, and Environment, University College London"}, "57214866920": {"Name": "Li M.", "AuthorID": "57214866920", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Healthy Ageing and the Research Department of Genetics, Evolution, and Environment, University College London"}, "57203171697": {"Name": "Feseha Y.", "AuthorID": "57203171697", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Healthy Ageing and the Research Department of Genetics, Evolution, and Environment, University College London"}, "6602213773": {"Name": "Alic N.", "AuthorID": "6602213773", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Healthy Ageing and the Research Department of Genetics, Evolution, and Environment, University College London"}, "7004705385": {"Name": "Broughton S.J.", "AuthorID": "7004705385", "AffiliationID": "60117609, 60117607, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical and Life Sciences, Faculty of Health and Medicine, Lancaster University"}}}
