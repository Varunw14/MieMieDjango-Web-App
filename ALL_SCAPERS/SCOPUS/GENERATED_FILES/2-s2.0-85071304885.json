KGaA, WeinheimNonadherence to assigned treatment is common in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Recently, there has been increased interest in estimating causal effects of treatment received, for example, the so-called local average treatment effect (LATE). Instrumental variables (IV) methods can be used for identification, with estimation proceeding either via fully parametric mixture models or two-stage least squares (TSLS). TSLS is popular but can be problematic for binary outcomes where the estimand of interest is a causal odds ratio. Mixture models are rarely used in practice, perhaps because of their perceived complexity and need for specialist software. Here, we propose using multiple imputation (MI) to impute the latent compliance class appearing in the mixture models. Since such models include an interaction term between the latent compliance class and randomized treatment, we use \u201csubstantive model compatible\u201d MI (SMC MIC), which can additionally handle missing data in outcomes and other variables in the model, before fitting the mixture models via maximum likelihood to the MI data sets and combining results via Rubin's rules. We use simulations to compare the performance of SMC MIC to existing approaches and also illustrate the methods by reanalyzing an RCT in UK primary health. We show that SMC MIC can be more efficient than full Bayesian estimation when auxiliary variables are incorporated, and is superior to two-stage methods, especially for binary outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["instrumental variables", "local average treatment effect", "missing data", "multiple imputation", "nonadherence"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biometry", "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy", "Humans", "Models, Statistical", "Pain Management", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071304885", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"]], "AuthorData": {"55801880600": {"Name": "DiazOrdaz K.", "AuthorID": "55801880600", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Statistics, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7402041012": {"Name": "Carpenter J.", "AuthorID": "7402041012", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Statistics, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}}}
