Bringas Vega et al.We used EEG source analysis to identify which cortical areas were involved in the automatic and controlled processes of inhibitory control on a flanker task and compared the potential efficacy of recombinant-human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) on the performance of Parkinson's Disease patients. The samples were 18 medicated PD patients (nine of them received rHuEPO in addition to their usual anti-PD medication through random allocation and the other nine patients were on their regular anti-PD medication only) and 9 age and education-matched healthy controls (HCs) who completed the flanker task with simultaneous EEG recordings. N1 and N2 event-related potential (ERP) components were identified and a low resolution tomography (LORETA) inverse solution was employed to localize the neural generators. Reaction times and errors were increased for the incongruent flankers for PD patients compared to controls. EEG source analysis identified an effect of rHuEPO on the lingual gyri for the early N1 component. N2-related sources in middle cingulate and precuneus were associated with the inhibition of automatic responses evoked by incongruent stimuli differentiated PD and HCs. From our results rHuEPO seems to mediate an effect on N1 sources in lingual gyri but not on behavioural performance. N2-related sources in middle cingulate and precuneus were evoked by incongruent stimuli differentiated PD and HCs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086654057", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (miscellaneous)", "NEUR", "2801"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"30367505400": {"Name": "Bringas Vega M.L.", "AuthorID": "30367505400", "AffiliationID": "60068367", "AffiliationName": "Centro Internacional de Restauracion Neurologica CIREN"}, "57221491687": {"Name": "Liu S.", "AuthorID": "57221491687", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Hospital of Chengdu Brain Science Institute, MOE Key Lab for Neuroinformation, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "57218180076": {"Name": "Zhang M.", "AuthorID": "57218180076", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Hospital of Chengdu Brain Science Institute, MOE Key Lab for Neuroinformation, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "7006891841": {"Name": "Jahanshahi M.", "AuthorID": "7006891841", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "6603440858": {"Name": "Valdes-Sosa P.A.", "AuthorID": "6603440858", "AffiliationID": "60077495", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Neurociencias de Cuba CNEURO"}, "16231327000": {"Name": "Pedroso Iba\u00f1ez I.", "AuthorID": "16231327000", "AffiliationID": "60068367", "AffiliationName": "Centro Internacional de Restauracion Neurologica CIREN"}, "6602193834": {"Name": "Morales Chacon L.M.", "AuthorID": "6602193834", "AffiliationID": "60068367", "AffiliationName": "Centro Internacional de Restauracion Neurologica CIREN"}, "6505998341": {"Name": "Galan Garcia L.", "AuthorID": "6505998341", "AffiliationID": "60077495", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Neurociencias de Cuba CNEURO"}, "57217182300": {"Name": "Perez Bocourt V.", "AuthorID": "57217182300", "AffiliationID": "60005698", "AffiliationName": "Miami Dade College"}}}
