Scene re-creations employed three types of distance: actual close sounds (close to the sound source recorded on site), actual distant sounds (distance attenuation recorded on site) and artificial distant sounds (reduction of the same decibel level across frequencies). Participants displayed higher heart rate, amplitude of the R-wave (\u0394R), heart rate variability, respiration rate, and skin conductance level (SCL) when close to the sound source. Actual distance attenuation affected most subjective evaluation factors (except for Familiarity and Excitement). The \u0394R, electroencephalography alpha reactivity, and electroencephalography beta reactivity with actual distant sounds were lower and SCL was higher, relative to those with artificial distant sounds. These findings provide a reference for governments and urban planners when working to improve quality of life in urban areas.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Physiological response", "Sound source distance", "Soundscapes", "Subjective evaluation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Actual distance", "Distance-attenuation", "Heart rate variability", "Physiological indicators", "Quality of life", "Respiration rate", "Skin conductance", "Subjective evaluations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090339342", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"]], "AuthorData": {"57209261189": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "57209261189", "AffiliationID": "60019616", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Cold Region Urban and Rural Human Settlement Environment Science and Technology, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, School of Architecture, Harbin Institute of Technology"}, "57199507019": {"Name": "Ba M.", "AuthorID": "57199507019", "AffiliationID": "60019616", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Cold Region Urban and Rural Human Settlement Environment Science and Technology, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, School of Architecture, Harbin Institute of Technology"}, "55485135500": {"Name": "Kang J.", "AuthorID": "55485135500", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}}}
