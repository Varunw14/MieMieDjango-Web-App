All rights reserved.Advances in brain-imaging techniques have enabled cognitive neuroscientists to investigate the emergence of cognition in relation to brain development. This line of work has led to the advancement of three views concerning the functional development of the human brain during infancy and childhood: (1) the maturational view, (2) the interactive specialization view, and (3) the skill-learning view. In this article, findings from imaging, neuropsychological, and behavioral studies on the development of face processing, working memory, long-term memory, and language are described in reference to these views. From these examples, it becomes clear that all three theories of functional development are valuable for our understanding of brain-behavior relations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amnesia", "Brain", "Developmental cognitive neuroscience", "Event-related potentials", "Face processing", "Fusiform face area", "Hemispheric differences", "Hippocampus", "Infancy", "Language", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Medial temporal lobe", "Memory", "Plasticity", "Prefrontal cortex"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079564700", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55790832200": {"Name": "Bathelt J.", "AuthorID": "55790832200", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "University of Amsterdam, Department of Psychology"}, "57204024918": {"Name": "Downes M.", "AuthorID": "57204024918", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "University College Dublin, School of Psychology"}, "7004346948": {"Name": "De Haan M.", "AuthorID": "7004346948", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}}}
