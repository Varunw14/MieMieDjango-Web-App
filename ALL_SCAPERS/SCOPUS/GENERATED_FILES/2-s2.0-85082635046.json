The ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous mutations (dN/dS) has become a popular method to detect selection in somatic cells. However the link, in somatic evolution, between dN/dS values and fitness coefficients is missing. Here we present a quantitative model of somatic evolutionary dynamics that determines the selective coefficients of individual driver mutations from dN/dS estimates. We then measure the DFE for somatic mutant clones in ostensibly normal oesophagus and skin. We reveal a broad distribution of fitness effects, with the largest fitness increases found for TP53 and NOTCH1 mutants (proliferative bias 1-5%). This study provides the theoretical link between dN/dS values and selective coefficients in somatic evolution, and measures the DFE of mutations in human tissues.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082635046", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"57061265800": {"Name": "Williams M.J.", "AuthorID": "57061265800", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Computational Oncology, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"}, "54788610100": {"Name": "Werner B.", "AuthorID": "54788610100", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Genomics and Computational Biology, Barts Cancer Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "26021895300": {"Name": "Graham T.A.", "AuthorID": "26021895300", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Genomics and Computational Biology, Barts Cancer Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "55704742600": {"Name": "Zapata L.", "AuthorID": "55704742600", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Evolutionary Genomics and Modelling Lab, Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "25947907300": {"Name": "Sottoriva A.", "AuthorID": "25947907300", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Evolutionary Genomics and Modelling Lab, Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "57202058182": {"Name": "Barnes C.P.", "AuthorID": "57202058182", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}}}
