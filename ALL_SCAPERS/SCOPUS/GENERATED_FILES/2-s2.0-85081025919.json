There are a number of other sclerosing skin diseases that should be considered in the differential diagnosis and these are important because they may require specialist investigation and management. In addition, long-term follow up of the different conditions should reflect the risk of associated complications and anticipated duration of therapy. This article reviews the clinical features of potential mimics of scleroderma (systemic sclerosis) including localised forms of scleroderma (morphoea) and other conditions that lead to skin thickening and connective tissue fibrosis or scarring.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fasciitis", "Graft versus host disease", "Morphoea", "Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis", "Raynaud's phenomenon", "Scleroderma", "Scleromyxoedema", "Systemic sclerosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Diagnosis, Differential", "Humans", "Raynaud Disease", "Rheumatic Diseases", "Scleroderma, Localized", "Scleroderma, Systemic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081025919", "SubjectAreas": [["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"]], "AuthorData": {"6601959867": {"Name": "Orteu C.H.", "AuthorID": "6601959867", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8398311200": {"Name": "Ong V.H.", "AuthorID": "8398311200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology, Royal Free Campus, University College London"}, "7006031021": {"Name": "Denton C.P.", "AuthorID": "7006031021", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology, Royal Free Campus, University College London"}}}
