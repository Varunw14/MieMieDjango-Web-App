However, when using microfluidic channels with millimeter to micron scale dimensions, together with optical sensing methods, these configurations result in short path lengths over which the signal can be acquired. Whilst polarimetry would greatly benefit from using small volumes, providing important information on the structure of chiral biomarkers in life sciences, the small interrogation volumes associated with the use of minute samples decreases the numbers of molecules in the light path that cause an optical rotation and reduces the sensitivity of the technique. Here, we show that when an optical beam, passing through a chiral sample, undergoes multiple reflections from suitably aligned external micromirrors, the usual cancelling out of the optical rotation, that occurs when the rotated polarized beam is passed back through a solution following reflection at a single mirror, can be negated. This enables the chirality of molecular species present in a microfluidic sample to be measured with increased sensitivity. This approach was validated experimentally using solutions of D-(+)-glucose as a model system, by investigating the effect of multiple reflections of a linearly polarized He-Ne laser beam and a 403 nm diode laser beam across the microfluidic channel. It was found that there was a 30-fold enhancement in the limit of detection with as few as 11 reflections through the sample.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electromagnetic wave sensors", "microfluidics", "polarimetry", "polarization", "reflections"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electromagnetic wave sensors", "Limit of detection", "Linearly polarized", "Microfluidic channel", "Molecular species", "Multi-reflection", "Multiple reflections", "Optical sensing method"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079880587", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"57207189204": {"Name": "Al-Hafidh M.H.", "AuthorID": "57207189204", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, James Watt School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "7003822477": {"Name": "Glidle A.", "AuthorID": "7003822477", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, James Watt School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "57195957787": {"Name": "Wilson R.", "AuthorID": "57195957787", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, James Watt School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "25825387900": {"Name": "Reboud J.", "AuthorID": "25825387900", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, James Watt School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "55154841200": {"Name": "Cooper J.M.", "AuthorID": "55154841200", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, James Watt School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "26034296000": {"Name": "Kelly A.E.", "AuthorID": "26034296000", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Electronic and Nanoscale Engineering, James Watt School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}}}
