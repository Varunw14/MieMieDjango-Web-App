The present study aimed to develop and perform preliminary psychometric testing for a novel IN instrument specific to OED. Subjects and methods: Patients diagnosed with OED were invited to complete the Oral Epithelial Dysplasia Informational Needs Questionnaire (ODIN-Q), which was developed based on a known theoretical framework and with items generated via expert input and the literature. Face validity and content validity were initially assessed prior to finalisation of the tool. ODIN-Q was tested for internal consistency and test\u2013retest reliability along with construct validity. Results: ODIN-Q consists of 35 items, categorised under six domains, and rated by dual 4-point Likert scales (amount of information received and degree of importance). Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) was rated \u201cexcellent\u201d for the scale (0.93) and both subscales (0.92/0.94). For test\u2013retest reliability, moderate agreement was found (\u03ba = 0.49\u20130.53). Regarding construct validity, a significant but limited relationship was found between ODIN-Q and the Krantz Health Opinion Survey. Conclusion: ODIN-Q showed adequate psychometric properties of reliability and validity. Further validation is, however, needed to assess its structural validity and responsiveness.", "AuthorKeywords": ["health education", "information needs", "needs assessment", "patient preference", "precancerous conditions", "validation study"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096710712", "SubjectAreas": [["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"], ["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"57202086332": {"Name": "Alsoghier A.", "AuthorID": "57202086332", "AffiliationID": "60013183", "AffiliationName": "College of Dentistry, King Saud University"}, "26425158200": {"Name": "Riordain R.N.", "AuthorID": "26425158200", "AffiliationID": "60002199, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Cork University Dental School and Hospital, University College Cork"}, "7004087651": {"Name": "Fedele S.", "AuthorID": "7004087651", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Centre, NIHR University College London Hospitals"}, "7201730425": {"Name": "Porter S.", "AuthorID": "7201730425", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013985", "AffiliationName": "UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "36716631400": {"Name": "Liew C.", "AuthorID": "36716631400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Head and Neck Centre, University College London Hospitals"}}}
