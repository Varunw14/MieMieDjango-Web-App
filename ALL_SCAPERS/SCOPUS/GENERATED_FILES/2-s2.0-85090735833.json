AMO-02 (tideglusib) inhibits GSK3\u03b2 activity in preclinical models of type 1 myotonic dystrophy and promotes cellular maturation as well as normalizes aberrant molecular and behavioral phenotypes. This phase 2 study assessed the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of AMO-02 in adolescents and adults with congenital and childhood-onset type 1 myotonic dystrophy. Methods: Sixteen subjects (aged 13 to 34 years) with congenital and childhood-onset type 1 myotonic dystrophy received 12 weeks of single-blind fixed-dose oral treatment with either 400 mg (n = 8) or 1000 mg (n = 8) AMO-02 (NCT02858908). Blood samples were obtained for pharmacokinetic assessment. Safety assessments, such as laboratory tests and electrocardiograms, as well as efficacy assessments of syndromal, cognitive, and muscular functioning, were obtained. Results: AMO-02 plasma concentrations conformed to a two-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination, and dose-dependent increases in exposure (area under the curve) were observed. AMO-02 was generally safe and well-tolerated. No early discontinuations due to adverse events or dose adjustments of AMO-02 occurred. The majority of subjects manifested clinical improvement in their central nervous system and neuromuscular symptoms after 12 weeks of treatment compared with the placebo baseline, with a larger response noted at the 1000 mg/day dose level. AMO-02 exposure (cumulative area under the curve) was significantly correlated (P < 0.01) with change from baseline on several key efficacy assessments. Conclusion: AMO-02 has favorable pharmacokinetic and clinical risk/benefit profiles meriting further study as a potential treatment for congenital and childhood-onset type 1 myotonic dystrophy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CDM-1", "Clinical trial", "DM-1", "GSK-3\u03b2", "PK/PD"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090735833", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"7004135090": {"Name": "Horrigan J.", "AuthorID": "7004135090", "AffiliationID": "122105861", "AffiliationName": "AMO Pharma Ltd"}, "56496643800": {"Name": "Snape M.", "AuthorID": "56496643800", "AffiliationID": "122105861", "AffiliationName": "AMO Pharma Ltd"}, "57218913831": {"Name": "McMorn A.", "AuthorID": "57218913831", "AffiliationID": "122105861", "AffiliationName": "AMO Pharma Ltd"}, "57218911101": {"Name": "Evans S.", "AuthorID": "57218911101", "AffiliationID": "122105861", "AffiliationName": "AMO Pharma Ltd"}, "57218908266": {"Name": "Gomes T.B.", "AuthorID": "57218908266", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "John Walton Muscular Dystrophy Research Centre, Institute of Genetic Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "57193209075": {"Name": "Nikolenko N.", "AuthorID": "57193209075", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24336668600": {"Name": "Yaroshinsky A.", "AuthorID": "24336668600", "AffiliationID": "125105612", "AffiliationName": "Vital Systems, Inc."}, "8536932300": {"Name": "Della Pasqua O.", "AuthorID": "8536932300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, University College London"}, "57035360700": {"Name": "Oosterholt S.", "AuthorID": "57035360700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, University College London"}, "57207904767": {"Name": "Lochm\u00fcller H.", "AuthorID": "57207904767", "AffiliationID": "60018471, 60028897, 60085927", "AffiliationName": "Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute; Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, The Ottawa Hospital; and Brain and Mind Research Institute, University of Ottawa"}}}
