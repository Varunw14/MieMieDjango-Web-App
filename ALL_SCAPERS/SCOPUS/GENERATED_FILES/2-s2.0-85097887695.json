Furthermore, beyond the synergetic effect, in catalytic pyrolysis the presence of plastic may facilitate the contact between catalyst and biomass. In this study, the effect of pretreatment of plastic/biomass was investigated, in order to further improve the above aims. The first pretreatment method was pre-degradation treatment at relatively low temperatures where solid state reactions alter the structure of plastic/biomass but no volatile products are formed. In addition, a second pretreatment method was used for the catalytic pyrolysis of cellulose, namely co-pressing of cellulose and catalyst particles into mixed pellets. Thermogravimetric results confirmed that pre-degradation treatment reduced the decomposition temperature of cellulose. Pre-degradation diminished the hindering effect of the cellulose-derived char/ catalyst-coke demonstrating significant interaction between cellulose and lldPE (linear low density polyethylene) before the charring/coking stage of cellulose. While in the absence of catalyst, there is a minimal interaction between lldPE and cellulose, as the molten lldPE layers around cellulose particles inhibited the escape of the biomass-derived volatile products, the use of catalyst along with pre-degradation provided maximum interaction between lldPE and cellulose pyrolysates which proceeded at lower reaction temperature without any hindrance from char/coke formation. Furthermore, pre-degradation treatment increased the liquid yield with associated increase in char/coke yield. The presence of lldPE during the cellulose pyrolysis decreased the concentration of char/coke on the catalyst while higher amounts of hard coke/char had accumulated on the pre-treated samples. Liquid product characterisation indicated that co-pressing of cellulose with catalyst is more effective in converting cellulose-derived products into aromatics. The results suggest that pre-treatment processes have increased the synergy between lldPE and cellulose, thereby enhancing the quantity and quality of the desired liquid product.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Co-pyrolysis", "Coke characterisation", "Liquid characterisation", "Pre-treatment process"], "IndexKeywords": ["Catalytic pyrolysis", "Cellulose pyrolysis", "Decomposition temperature", "Lower reaction temperature", "Minimal interactions", "Pretreatment methods", "Pretreatment process", "Thermo-gravimetric"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85097887695", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"]], "AuthorData": {"57200499856": {"Name": "Muhammad I.", "AuthorID": "57200499856", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004913362": {"Name": "Manos G.", "AuthorID": "7004913362", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
