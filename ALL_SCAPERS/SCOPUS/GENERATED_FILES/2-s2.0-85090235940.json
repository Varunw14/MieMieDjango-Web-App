This paper summarises the evidence provided by the company; the appraisal of the evidence by the Peninsula Technology Appraisal Group, who were commissioned to act as the independent evidence review group (ERG); and the development of the NICE guidance by the appraisal committee. The evidence presented by the company highlighted the significant lifelong burden of IRD for patients and carers. Evidence to support the effectiveness of VN was lacking, but the available evidence showed a modest, sustained improvement across a variety of vision-related outcomes. While patients would remain visually impaired, the committee considered that VN would prevent further deterioration in vision. The modelling approach used by the company had a number of limitations and relied heavily upon a large volume of clinical expert input to produce cost-effectiveness estimates with large uncertainty around long-term effectiveness. The ERG\u2019s main concerns revolved around these long-term outcomes and the plausibility of utility values. The NICE committee were convinced that the clinical benefits of VN were important and an appropriate use of national health service resources within a specialised service. The committee concluded that a high unmet need existed in patients with RPE65-mediated IRD and that VN represents a step change in the management of this condition.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090235940", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57218762947": {"Name": "Farmer C.", "AuthorID": "57218762947", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Peninsula Technology Assessment Group (PenTAG), University of Exeter"}, "56966665700": {"Name": "Bullement A.", "AuthorID": "56966665700", "AffiliationID": "121016418", "AffiliationName": "Delta Hat, Ltd."}, "57194100963": {"Name": "Packman D.", "AuthorID": "57194100963", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Peninsula Technology Assessment Group (PenTAG), University of Exeter"}, "8731603400": {"Name": "Long L.", "AuthorID": "8731603400", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Peninsula Technology Assessment Group (PenTAG), University of Exeter"}, "57220888241": {"Name": "Robinson S.", "AuthorID": "57220888241", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Peninsula Technology Assessment Group (PenTAG), University of Exeter"}, "57218762636": {"Name": "Nikram E.", "AuthorID": "57218762636", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Peninsula Technology Assessment Group (PenTAG), University of Exeter"}, "56414854100": {"Name": "Hatswell A.J.", "AuthorID": "56414854100", "AffiliationID": "121016418", "AffiliationName": "Delta Hat, Ltd."}, "57188672699": {"Name": "Melendez-Torres G.J.", "AuthorID": "57188672699", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Peninsula Technology Assessment Group (PenTAG), University of Exeter"}, "37015401400": {"Name": "Crathorne L.", "AuthorID": "37015401400", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Peninsula Technology Assessment Group (PenTAG), University of Exeter"}}}
