Waste recycling is an important part of a circular economy. However, for some materials, the potential environmental benefits of recycling are unclear or contested. Here, we focus on the global paper life cycle, which generates 1.3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and estimate the climate change mitigation potential of circularity. We model material use, energy use and emissions up to 2050 for various levels of waste recycling and recovery. We show that emission pathways consistent with a 2 \u00b0C global warming target require strong reductions in the carbon intensity of electricity and heat generation. We also show that additional recycling yields small or negative climate change mitigation benefits when it requires high-carbon grid electricity and displaces virgin pulping that is powered by low-carbon pulping by-products. The results indicate that circular economy efforts should carefully consider the energy implications of recycling.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Carbon intensity", "Circular economy", "Climate change mitigation", "Environmental benefits", "High carbons", "Model materials", "Pulp and paper", "Waste recycling"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092903240", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Food Science", "AGRI", "1106"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"], ["Nature and Landscape Conservation", "ENVI", "2309"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"56439947900": {"Name": "van Ewijk S.", "AuthorID": "56439947900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Sustainable Resources, University College London"}, "7005025101": {"Name": "Stegemann J.A.", "AuthorID": "7005025101", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "7004909341": {"Name": "Ekins P.", "AuthorID": "7004909341", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Sustainable Resources, University College London"}}}
