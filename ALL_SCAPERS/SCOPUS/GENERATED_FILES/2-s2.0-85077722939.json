All rights reserved.\"Ion Channels and Neuropharmacology: From the Past to the Future\" is the main theme of articles in Volume 60 of the Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology. Reviews in this volume discuss a wide spectrum of therapeutically relevant ion channels and GPCRs with a particular emphasis on structural studies that elucidate drug binding sites and mechanisms of action. The regulation of ion channels by second messengers, including Ca2+ and cyclic AMP, and lipid mediators is also highly relevant to several of the ion channels discussed, including KCNQ channels, HCN channels, L-type Ca2+ channels, and AMPA receptors, as well as the aquaporin channels. Molecular identification of exactly where drugs bind in the structure not only elucidates their mechanism of action but also aids future structure-based drug discovery efforts to focus on relevant pharmacophores. The ion channels discussed here are targets for multiple nervous system diseases, including epilepsy and neuropathic pain. This theme complements several previous themes, including \"New Therapeutic Targets,\" \"New Approaches for Studying Drug and Toxicant Action: Applications to Drug Discovery and Development,\" and \"New Methods and Novel Therapeutic Approaches in Pharmacology and Toxicology.\".", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Drug Development", "Drug Discovery", "Humans", "Ion Channels", "Neuropharmacology"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077722939", "SubjectAreas": [["Toxicology", "PHAR", "3005"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"24498942300": {"Name": "Dolphin A.C.", "AuthorID": "24498942300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "56827226100": {"Name": "Insel P.A.", "AuthorID": "56827226100", "AffiliationID": "60030612", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Pharmacology and Medicine, University of California, San Diego"}, "7005427513": {"Name": "Blaschke T.F.", "AuthorID": "7005427513", "AffiliationID": "60032838", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine"}, "7202256788": {"Name": "Meyer U.A.", "AuthorID": "7202256788", "AffiliationID": "60015184", "AffiliationName": "Biozentrum, University of Basel"}}}
