Aortic stiffness is reduced through supervised training programs, but these are not easily generalizable. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine whether real-world exercise training for a first-time marathon can reverse age-related aortic stiffening. Methods: Untrained healthy individuals underwent 6 months of training for the London Marathon. Assessment pre-training and 2 weeks post-marathon included central (aortic) blood pressure and aortic stiffness using cardiovascular magnetic resonance distensibility. Biological \u201caortic age\u201d was calculated from the baseline chronological age-stiffness relationship. Change in stiffness was assessed at the ascending (Ao-A) and descending aorta at the pulmonary artery bifurcation (Ao-P) and diaphragm (Ao-D). Data are mean changes (95% confidence intervals [CIs]). Results: A total of 138 first-time marathon completers (age 21 to 69 years, 49% male) were assessed, with an estimated training schedule of 6 to 13 miles/week. At baseline, a decade of chronological aging correlated with a decrease in Ao-A, Ao-P, and Ao-D distensibility by 2.3, 1.9, and 3.1 \u00d7 10\u22123 mm Hg\u22121, respectively (p < 0.05 for all). Training decreased systolic and diastolic central (aortic) blood pressure by 4 mm Hg (95% CI: 2.8 to 5.5 mm Hg) and 3 mm Hg (95% CI: 1.6 to 3.5 mm Hg). Descending aortic distensibility increased (Ao-P: 9%; p = 0.009; Ao-D: 16%; p = 0.002), while remaining unchanged in the Ao-A. These translated to a reduction in \u201caortic age\u201d by 3.9 years (95% CI: 1.1 to 7.6 years) and 4.0 years (95% CI: 1.7 to 8.0 years) (Ao-P and Ao-D, respectively). Benefit was greater in older, male participants with slower running times (p < 0.05 for all). Conclusions: Training for and completing a marathon even at relatively low exercise intensity reduces central blood pressure and aortic stiffness\u2014equivalent to a \u223c4-year reduction in vascular age. Greater rejuvenation was observed in older, slower individuals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aging", "aortic stiffness", "blood pressure", "cardiovascular magnetic resonance", "exercise training", "marathon"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aging", "Blood Pressure", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "London", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Physical Conditioning, Human", "Prospective Studies", "Running", "Vascular Stiffness", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076845576", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"34970790200": {"Name": "Bhuva A.N.", "AuthorID": "34970790200", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Imaging, Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "55383197700": {"Name": "Jones S.", "AuthorID": "55383197700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "57212494453": {"Name": "Nadarajan N.", "AuthorID": "57212494453", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "7005513520": {"Name": "Chaturvedi N.", "AuthorID": "7005513520", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "57202314649": {"Name": "Moon J.C.", "AuthorID": "57202314649", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Imaging, Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "57207789660": {"Name": "Hughes A.D.", "AuthorID": "57207789660", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "6504025861": {"Name": "Manisty C.H.", "AuthorID": "6504025861", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Imaging, Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "37035196200": {"Name": "Torlasco C.", "AuthorID": "37035196200", "AffiliationID": "60006646", "AffiliationName": "Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS, Department of Cardiovascular, Neural and Metabolic Sciences, San Luca Hospital"}, "57190162808": {"Name": "Van Zalen J.", "AuthorID": "57190162808", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Imaging, Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "55645073800": {"Name": "Lloyd G.", "AuthorID": "55645073800", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Imaging, Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "56398021700": {"Name": "D'Silva A.", "AuthorID": "56398021700", "AffiliationID": "60010426, 60029329", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Clinical & Academic Group, St George's, University of London"}, "7405877896": {"Name": "Sharma S.", "AuthorID": "7405877896", "AffiliationID": "60010426, 60029329", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Clinical & Academic Group, St George's, University of London"}}}
