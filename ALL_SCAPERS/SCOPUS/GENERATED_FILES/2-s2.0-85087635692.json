Defining the quality of these spaces based on room acoustics criteria alone might be challenging if aspects related to their functioning (e.g., speech-based activities) are not taken into account. The acoustical capacity concept has been previously proposed for eating establishments as a way to provide a quality assessment based on both physical characteristics of the space and the perceived quality of verbal communication. In this study, a revised version of a prediction model for ambient noise levels based on occupancy and an estimation of acoustical capacity are proposed for nursing homes hosting people with dementia, and the corresponding parameters of slope, group size and absorption per person are optimized for the specific application, using a Nursing Home in Flanders (Belgium) participating to the AcustiCare project as case study. Results show that, compared to normal eating establishments, lower absorption per person values and higher group size values should be used in nursing homes to reduce errors in ambient noise levels prediction. Furthermore, using a retrofit intervention carried out in the living room of the Nursing Home, the enhanced acoustical capacity of the space was analysed. Results, in this case, show that, prior to the retrofit intervention, the acoustical capacity was already exceeded with average occupancy (i.e., saturated in normal functioning conditions), while the reduction in reverberation time achieved with the retrofit increased considerably the acoustical capacity of the space, shifting the quality of verbal communication in the living room from insufficient to satisfactory.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acoustical capacity", "BPSD", "Indoor soundscape", "Nursing homes", "Verbal communication"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087635692", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Process Chemistry and Technology", "CENG", "1508"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes", "CENG", "1507"]], "AuthorData": {"56985576800": {"Name": "Devos P.", "AuthorID": "56985576800", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information Technology, Ghent University"}, "55457923800": {"Name": "Thomas P.", "AuthorID": "55457923800", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information Technology, Ghent University"}, "35188672900": {"Name": "De Vriendt P.", "AuthorID": "35188672900", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information Technology, Ghent University"}, "6701666696": {"Name": "Botteldooren D.", "AuthorID": "6701666696", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information Technology, Ghent University"}, "55557756700": {"Name": "Aletta F.", "AuthorID": "55557756700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering, University College London"}, "57195471166": {"Name": "Mynsbrugge T.V.", "AuthorID": "57195471166", "AffiliationID": "112649075", "AffiliationName": "Department of Occupational Therapy, Artevelde University College"}, "36968854500": {"Name": "Van de Velde D.", "AuthorID": "36968854500", "AffiliationID": "112649075", "AffiliationName": "Department of Occupational Therapy, Artevelde University College"}, "15837843200": {"Name": "Petrovic M.", "AuthorID": "15837843200", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Ghent University"}}}
