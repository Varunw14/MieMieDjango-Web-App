In this direction, significant advances have been recently made in visual-perception driven autonomy, which is mainly due to the availability of rich sensory data-sets. However, current robots\u2019 physical interaction autonomy levels still remain at a basic level. Towards providing a systematic approach to this problem, this paper presents a new context-aware and adaptive method that allows a robotic platform to interact with unknown environments. In particular, a multi-axes self-tuning impedance controller is introduced to regulate quasi-static parameters of the robot based on previous experience in interacting with similar environments and the real-time sensory data. The proposed method is also capable of differentiating internal and external disruptions, and responding to them accordingly and appropriately. An agricultural experiment with different deformable material is presented to validate robot interaction autonomy improvements, and the capability of the proposed methodology in detecting and responding to unexpected events (e.g., faults).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adaptive control", "Impedance control", "Interaction autonomy", "Robotic manipulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Autonomous robotics", "Deformable material", "Impedance controllers", "Physical interactions", "Robot interactions", "Uncertain environments", "Unstructured environments", "Visual perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088986144", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"57215558904": {"Name": "Balatti P.", "AuthorID": "57215558904", "AffiliationID": "60028868", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa"}, "23388667500": {"Name": "Ajoudani A.", "AuthorID": "23388667500", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "HRI Laboratory, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia"}, "26023306800": {"Name": "Kanoulas D.", "AuthorID": "26023306800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "56275172000": {"Name": "Tsagarakis N.", "AuthorID": "56275172000", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "HHCM Laboratory, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia"}}}
