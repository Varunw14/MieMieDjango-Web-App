All rights reserved.Humans and other animals use multiple strategies for making decisions. Reinforcement-learning theory distinguishes between stimulus-response (model-free; MF) learning and deliberative (model-based; MB) planning. The spatial-navigation literature presents a parallel dichotomy between navigation strategies. In \"response learning,\" associated with the dorsolateral striatum (DLS), decisions are anchored to an egocentric reference frame. In \"place learning,\" associated with the hippocampus, decisions are anchored to an allocentric reference frame. Emerging evidence suggests that the contribution of hippocampus to place learning may also underlie its contribution to MB learning by representing relational structure in a cognitive map. Here, we introduce a computational model in which hippocampus subserves place and MB learning by learning a \"successor representation\" of relational structure between states; DLS implements model-free response learning by learning associations between actions and egocentric representations of landmarks; and action values from either system are weighted by the reliability of its predictions. We show that this model reproduces a range of seemingly disparate behavioral findings in spatial and nonspatial decision tasks and explains the effects of lesions to DLS and hippocampus on these tasks. Furthermore, modeling place cells as driven by boundaries explains the observation that, unlike navigation guided by landmarks, navigation guided by boundaries is robust to \"blocking\" by prior state-reward associations due to learned associations between place cells. Our model, originally shaped by detailed constraints in the spatial literature, successfully characterizes the hippocampal-striatal system as a general system for decision making via adaptive combination of stimulus-response learning and the use of a cognitive map.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hippocampus", "Reinforcement learning", "Spatial navigation", "Striatum"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Physiological", "Computer Simulation", "Corpus Striatum", "Decision Making", "Hippocampus", "Learning", "Maze Learning", "Models, Neurological", "Spatial Memory", "Task Performance and Analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85097578198", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57192888803": {"Name": "Geerts J.P.", "AuthorID": "57192888803", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "23767252700": {"Name": "Burgess N.", "AuthorID": "23767252700", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "8360773500": {"Name": "Chersi F.", "AuthorID": "8360773500", "AffiliationID": "123412621", "AffiliationName": "GrAI Matter Labs"}, "55532749300": {"Name": "Stachenfeld K.L.", "AuthorID": "55532749300", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}}}
