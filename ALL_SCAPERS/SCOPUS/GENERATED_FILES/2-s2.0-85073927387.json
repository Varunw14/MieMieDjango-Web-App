In recent years research on OC has increased, however there is still little understanding of how individuals become engaged in OC, and specifically whether differences exist in engagement patterns between certain groups of OC offenders. A content analysis was undertaken on the auto/biographies of one-hundred OC offenders to collect data on engagement processes. Quantitative analysis was used to identify significant differences in the engagement processes between OC offenders who join (\u2018joiners\u2019) or form (\u2018founders\u2019) an OC operation. The results revealed that measures pertaining to risk-factors, criminal trajectories, turning points, criminal motivations and social influences in engagement statistically differed between the groups. It was concluded that \u2018founders\u2019 were influenced by short-term criminal opportunities and economic considerations towards OC engagement, whilst \u2018joiners\u2019 were impacted more so by long-term social dynamics arising from ties and exposure to OC, such as one\u2019s parents being engaged in OC. Both groups however, directly engaged through social dynamics. The current study provides preliminary findings which increase academic and practical understanding of the OC fraternity, but also the findings offer a basis on which to target legal interventions. Additionally, the new knowledge may be instrumental for building theories of OC engagement. Specifically, it is theorised that the circumstances in how \u2018joiners\u2019 become engaged in OC represents a \u2018contagion process\u2019.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Engagement", "Founders", "Joiners", "Organized crime"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073927387", "SubjectAreas": [["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"56723701800": {"Name": "Kemp L.", "AuthorID": "56723701800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57211410347": {"Name": "Zolghadriha S.", "AuthorID": "57211410347", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55347105400": {"Name": "Gill P.", "AuthorID": "55347105400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
