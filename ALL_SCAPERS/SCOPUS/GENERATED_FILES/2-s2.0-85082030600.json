Journal of Raman Spectroscopy published by John Wiley & Sons LtdHere we demonstrate the simultaneous recovery of multiplexed physical information of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanoparticles (pH and depth) using deep Raman spectroscopy. As has been shown previously and in accordance with theory, inelastically scattered photons arising from spectral peaks that are suitably separated can exhibit different optical properties in the media through which they travel. These differences can impact the relative intensities of the Raman peaks as a function of the transmission path length; thereby, the depth of signal generation is inherently encoded in the spectra; assuming the target is clustered at a single depth or location, its depth can be readily determined. Moreover, Raman spectroscopy is very sensitive to chemistry of a sample, and changes in pH are observed not only as changes in peak intensity through relevant protonation and deprotonation but also as shifts in spectral features. Here, we show it is possible to precisely predict the depth (root-mean-square error [RMSE] 5 %) of SERS nanoparticles in scattering media (0.5% intralipid) while also being able to noninvasively monitor simultaneously the pH levels (RMSE ~0.2 pH units) of the media surrounding the nanoparticles. This is important as it demonstrates that nanoparticles can be used to report on multiple physical properties including their depth. This opens avenues for a range of new applications including the noninvasive diagnosis and localisation of cancer lesions in clinical environment in vivo.", "AuthorKeywords": ["deep Raman spectroscopy", "depth", "pH", "SEDRS", "SERS"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082030600", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"]], "AuthorData": {"56900691700": {"Name": "Gardner B.", "AuthorID": "56900691700", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Exeter"}, "7202511172": {"Name": "Stone N.", "AuthorID": "7202511172", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Exeter"}, "7005659005": {"Name": "Matousek P.", "AuthorID": "7005659005", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Central Laser Facility, Research Complex at Harwell, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}}}
