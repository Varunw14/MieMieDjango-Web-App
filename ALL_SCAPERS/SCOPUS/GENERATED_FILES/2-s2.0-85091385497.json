Design/methodology/approach: The site where this experiment happens is a major London hospital, serving over a million patients every year. In the experiment, the hospital\u2019s snack and drink vending machines are redesigned. The impact on product sales are then analysed using robust statistical methods. Findings: Nutritional labelling has a statistically significant impact on product sales. Less of the unhealthiest products are sold. Healthier products and product placement designs have a larger impact but with less statistical significance. They require further testing. Research limitations/implications: Experts in service operations can use this experiment\u2019s regression modelling methods. The methods are ideal for measuring change over time in counting data sets in complex real world environments. Practical implications: There are suggestions for practical vending service change in this research. They are in line and add a practical example to Government policy guidance. Social implications: People using the redesigned vending machines have more opportunity for healthy lifestyle choices. Originality/value: The experiment provides statistical evidence in support of catering for healthier lifestyles.", "AuthorKeywords": ["NHS", "Nudge", "Point of sale", "Sales data", "Statistical methods", "Vending"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091385497", "SubjectAreas": [["Human Factors and Ergonomics", "SOCI", "3307"], ["Architecture", "ENGI", "2216"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"]], "AuthorData": {"57193824387": {"Name": "Campbell L.Z.", "AuthorID": "57193824387", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Environmental, Design and Engineering (IEDE), University College London"}, "15838056200": {"Name": "Pitt M.", "AuthorID": "15838056200", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment, University College London"}, "57068327900": {"Name": "Mclennan P.", "AuthorID": "57068327900", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of the Built Environment, UCL The Bartlett School of Planning, University College London"}}}
