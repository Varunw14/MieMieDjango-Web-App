Psychology and Psychotherapy: Theory, Research and Practice published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British Psychological SocietyObjective: This paper describes the development and summarizes the content of a competence framework for delivery of cognitive analytic therapy (CAT). Design: The framework was developed using the evidence-based method developed by Roth and Pilling (2008, Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapy, 36, 129). Methods: A review of the CAT outcome literature identified where CAT interventions had evidence of efficacy. Standard texts on CAT were primary sources for details of theory and practice. This process was supported by an expert reference group (ERG). The role of the ERG was to provide professional advice on areas where the evidence base was lacking, but where CAT interventions were commonly used by therapists trained in the model. Results: A framework was produced and structured in terms of core knowledge, core skills, and meta-competences (which require therapeutic judgement rather than simple adherence to a treatment protocol). Conclusions: The framework enables trainees, service users, service managers, and commissioners to better understand a) the core features of CAT and b) what competences need to be in place for CAT to be skilfully delivered in practice. Practitioner points: It is possible to define the core competences of CAT. Whilst generic competences are important, there are five CAT-specific domains of competence. The CAT-specific competences reflect the three-phase structure of the therapy: reformulation, recognition, and revision.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cognitive analytic therapy", "psychotherapy", "therapist competence"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090927010", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"35992209600": {"Name": "Parry G.", "AuthorID": "35992209600", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "University of Sheffield"}, "6604030116": {"Name": "Kellett S.", "AuthorID": "6604030116", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "University of Sheffield"}, "7401540829": {"Name": "Bennett D.", "AuthorID": "7401540829", "AffiliationID": "125121974", "AffiliationName": "Catalyse CAT Ltd"}, "7403051540": {"Name": "Roth A.D.", "AuthorID": "7403051540", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
