In order to determine dust survival rates, we have performed a set of hydrodynamic simulations using the grid-based code ASTROBEAR in order to model a shock wave interacting with clumpy supernova ejecta. Dust motions and destruction rates were computed using our newly developed external, post-processing code PAPERBOATS, which includes gas drag, grain charging, sputtering, and grain\u2013grain collisions. We have determined dust destruction rates for the oxygen-rich supernova remnant Cassiopeia A as a function of initial grain sizes and clump gas density. We found that up to 30 per cent of the carbon dust mass is able to survive the passage of the reverse shock if the initial grain size distribution is narrow with radii around \u223c10\u201350 nm for high gas densities, or with radii around \u223c 0.5\u20131.5 \u03bcm for low and medium gas densities. Silicate grains with initial radii around 10\u201330 nm show survival rates of up to 40 per cent for medium- and high-density contrasts, while silicate material with micron-sized distributions is mostly destroyed. For both materials, the surviving dust mass is rearranged into a new size distribution that can be approximated by two components: a power-law distribution of small grains and a lognormal distribution of grains having the same size range as the initial distribution. Our results show that grain\u2013grain collisions and sputtering are synergistic and that grain\u2013grain collisions can play a crucial role in determining the surviving dust budget in supernova remnants.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dust, extinction", "Hydrodynamics", "ISM: supernova remnants", "Methods: numerical", "Shock waves", "Supernovae: general", "Supernovae: individual: Cassiopeia A"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075251681", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"55633098300": {"Name": "Kirchschlager F.", "AuthorID": "55633098300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57214393713": {"Name": "Schmidt F.D.", "AuthorID": "57214393713", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "18041819500": {"Name": "Barlow M.J.", "AuthorID": "18041819500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57208853978": {"Name": "Bevan A.", "AuthorID": "57208853978", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57194941451": {"Name": "Priestley F.D.", "AuthorID": "57194941451", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, Cardiff University, Queen\u2019s Buildings, The Parade"}, "57190765242": {"Name": "Fogerty E.L.", "AuthorID": "57190765242", "AffiliationID": "60017069, 60006164", "AffiliationName": "Center for Theoretical Astrophysics, Los Alamos National Lab"}}}
