This is especially true in the case of position verification in radiotherapy which requires a high number of images per patient. This study presents a physical characterisation of a new clinical detector based on a thick layer of structured Thallium activated Cesium Iodide. We made a critical appraisal of its performance for the first time and determined its detective quantum efficiency (DQE) by acquiring the pre-sampling modulation transfer function and normalised noise power spectrum (NNPS). The investigation was conducted with the application of three x-ray beam qualities in compliance with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC 62220-1:2003) standard. The spatial resolution and NNPS results led to relatively high DQE values at all energies: DQEs (0.5) were 0.46 for 54kV, 0.52-0.56 for 74kV and 0.55-0.59 for 92kV.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Detective quantum efficiency", "International Electrotechnical Commission", "Low energy x rays", "Noise power spectrum", "Physical characterisation", "Quality determination", "Spatial resolution", "X-ray beam qualities"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073108783", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"]], "AuthorData": {"57211241218": {"Name": "Alzahrani H.", "AuthorID": "57211241218", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "37029000800": {"Name": "Sedgwick I.", "AuthorID": "37029000800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56249496800": {"Name": "Seller P.", "AuthorID": "56249496800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7005472272": {"Name": "Royle G.", "AuthorID": "7005472272", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55338683500": {"Name": "Ricketts K.", "AuthorID": "55338683500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57211240502": {"Name": "Richards S.", "AuthorID": "57211240502", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "26026005600": {"Name": "Konstantinidis A.", "AuthorID": "26026005600", "AffiliationID": "60028784", "AffiliationName": "Christie NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
