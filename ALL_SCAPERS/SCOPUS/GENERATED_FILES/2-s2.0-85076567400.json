Serum Institute of India Pvt. Ltd.\u2019s PCV candidate (SIIPL-PCV) has the potential to meet this need as manufacturing efficiency has been optimized and the vaccine targets the most prevalent disease-causing serotypes in Africa and Asia. We report SIIPL-PCV's safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity in adults, toddlers, and infants in The Gambia. Methods: This phase 1/2, randomized, double-blind trial sequentially enrolled 34 PCV-naive adults (18\u201340 years old), 112 PCV (Prevenar 13\u00ae [PCV13])-primed toddlers (12\u201315 months old), and 200 PCV-naive infants (6\u20138 weeks old), who were randomized (1:1) to receive SIIPL-PCV or a licensed comparator vaccine. Infants received three-doses of SIIPL-PCV or PCV13 at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age co-administered with routine Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) vaccines. Reactogenicity was solicited through seven-days post-vaccination; unsolicited adverse events (AEs) were assessed throughout the study. The safety and immunogenicity of a matching booster at 10\u201314 months of age were evaluated in a subset of 96 infants. Immune responses were evaluated post-primary and pre- and post-booster vaccinations. Results: Reactogenicity was primarily mild-to-moderate in severity. In infants, the most common solicited reactions were injection-site tenderness and fever, with no meaningful treatment-group differences. There were no serious or severe vaccine-related AEs and no meaningful trends in SAEs, vaccine-related AEs, or overall AEs. Infant post-primary seroresponse rates (IgG level \u2265 0.35 \u00b5g/mL) were \u226589% for all serotypes except 6A (79%) in the SIIPL-PCV group. IgG GMCs were >1 \u00b5g/mL for all serotypes in both SIIPL-PCV and PCV13 groups. Post-booster GMCs were comparable between groups. Conclusion: SIIPL-PCV was well-tolerated, had an acceptable safety profile, and was immunogenic for all vaccine serotypes. Results support the evaluation of SIIPL-PCV in a phase 3 non-inferiority trial.
