In particular, we focus on Signorini contact conditions. The Calder'on projector is used for the system matrix, and boundary conditions are weakly imposed using a particular variational boundary operator designed using techniques from augmented Lagrangian methods. We present a complete numerical a priori error analysis and present some numerical examples to illustrate the theory.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Boundary element methods", "Calder'on projector", "Nitsche's method", "Signorini problem"], "IndexKeywords": ["Augmented Lagrangian methods", "Boundary element formulations", "Boundary operators", "Priori error analysis", "Signorini contact conditions", "System matrices", "Weak impositions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091138891", "SubjectAreas": [["Numerical Analysis", "MATH", "2612"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"7004271452": {"Name": "BURMAN E.", "AuthorID": "7004271452", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "55326504200": {"Name": "FREI S.", "AuthorID": "55326504200", "AffiliationID": "60025525", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Konstanz"}, "57192094932": {"Name": "SCROGGS M.W.", "AuthorID": "57192094932", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge"}}}
