Methods: Brain MRIs of patients with intracerebral hemorrhages (ICHs) and/or cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) were assessed for the full spectrum of CSVD markers using validated scales: ICHs, CMBs, cortical superficial siderosis (cSS), white matter hyperintensities, MRI-visible perivascular spaces (PVS). PVS predominance pattern was grouped as centrum-semiovale (CSO)-PVS predominance, basal-ganglia (BG)-PVS predominance, CSO-PVS and BG-PVS equality. Patients with mixed cerebral hemorrhages were classified into mixed CAA-pattern or mixed HA-pattern according to the existence of cSS and/or a CSO-PVS predominance pattern and comparisons were performed. Results: We included 110 patients with CAA (strictly lobar ICHs/CMBs), 33 with HA (strictly deep ICHs/CMBs) and 97 with mixed lobar/deep ICHs/CMBs. Mixed patients were more similar to HA with respect to their MRI-CSVD markers, vascular risk profile and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures. In the mixed patients, 33 (34%) had cSS, a CSO-PVS predominance pattern, or both, and were defined as mixed CAA-pattern cases. The mixed CAA-pattern patients were more alike CAA patients regarding their MRI-CSVD markers, CSF and genetic profile. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the heterogeneous group of patients with mixed cerebral hemorrhages distribution can be further phenotyped according to the predominant underlying CSVD. cSS presence and a CSO-PVS predominance pattern could serve as strongly suggestive markers of a contribution from CAA among patients with mixed hemorrhages.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cerebral amyloid angiopathy", "Cerebral small vessel diseases", "Cerebrospinal fluid", "Intracerebral hemorrhage", "MRI", "Vascular dementia"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092483990", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57203980666": {"Name": "Scheumann V.", "AuthorID": "57203980666", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Otto-von-Guericke University"}, "26868229700": {"Name": "Schreiber F.", "AuthorID": "26868229700", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}, "57203992614": {"Name": "Perosa V.", "AuthorID": "57203992614", "AffiliationID": "60029929", "AffiliationName": "J.
