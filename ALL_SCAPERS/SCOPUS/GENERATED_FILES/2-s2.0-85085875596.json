Sequential serial scans in patients with extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) could inform on the value of PET-CT for monitoring response to treatment and defining cure. Patients and methods: HIV-negative adults with EPTB from eight sites across six countries had three 18F-FDG PET/CT scans: (i) within 2 weeks of enrolment, (ii) at 2 months into TB treatment and (iii) at end of ATT treatment. Scanning was performed according to the EANM guidelines. 18F-FDG PET/CT scans were performed 60 \u00b1 10 min after intravenous injection of 2.5\u20135.0 MBq/kg of 18F-FDG. Findings: One hundred and forty-seven patients with EPTB underwent 3 sequential scans. A progressive reduction over time of both the number of active sites and the uptake level (SUVmax) at these sites was seen. At the end of WHO recommended treatment, 53/147 (36.0%) patients had negative PET/CT scans, and 94/147 (63.9%) patients remained PET/CT positive, of which 12 patients had developed MDR TB. One died of brain tuberculoma. Interpretation: Current 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging technology cannot be used clinically as a biomarker of treatment response, cure or for decision-making on when to stop EPTB treatment. PET/CT remains a research tool for TB and further development of PET/CT is required using new Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific radiopharmaceuticals targeting high-density surface epitopes, gene targets or metabolic pathways.", "AuthorKeywords": ["18F-FDG PET/CT scan", "Biomarker", "Cure", "Disease activity", "Extrapulmonary tuberculosis", "Imaging", "Monitoring treatment", "Relapse", "Tuberculosis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085875596", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"7005791371": {"Name": "Bomanji J.", "AuthorID": "7005791371", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60090043", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, 5th Floor, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57215381962": {"Name": "Mann V.", "AuthorID": "57215381962", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60090043", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, 5th Floor, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57196546122": {"Name": "Sharma R.", "AuthorID": "57196546122", "AffiliationID": "60005159", "AffiliationName": "Division of Nuclear Medicine & PET Imaging, Specialist in Nuclear Medicine &Thyroid diseases, Molecular Imaging & Research Center (MIRC), INMAS"}, "35464993100": {"Name": "Mittal B.R.", "AuthorID": "35464993100", "AffiliationID": "60000137", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine & PET, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research"}, "7101904356": {"Name": "Gambhir S.", "AuthorID": "7101904356", "AffiliationID": "60025015", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, SGPGIMS"}, "57217034159": {"Name": "Qureshy A.", "AuthorID": "57217034159", "AffiliationID": "100426223", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Oncology (INMOL) Hospital"}, "57215379985": {"Name": "Begum S.M.F.", "AuthorID": "57215379985", "AffiliationID": "60007825", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Nuclear Medicine & Allied Sciences (NINMAS), BSM Medical University Campus"}, "54785022800": {"Name": "Paez D.", "AuthorID": "54785022800", "AffiliationID": "60019311", "AffiliationName": "Nuclear Medicine and Diagnostic Imaging Section, Division of Human Health, IAEA"}, "6602615811": {"Name": "Sathekge M.", "AuthorID": "6602615811", "AffiliationID": "60021902", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Steve Biko Academic Hospital, University of Pretoria"}, "57198173851": {"Name": "Vorster M.", "AuthorID": "57198173851", "AffiliationID": "60021902", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Steve Biko Academic Hospital, University of Pretoria"}, "6602587017": {"Name": "Sobic Saranovic D.", "AuthorID": "6602587017", "AffiliationID": "60069683, 60068815, 60068827", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine University of Belgrade and Center of Nuclear Medicine Clinical Center of Serbia"}, "6602507489": {"Name": "Pusuwan P.", "AuthorID": "6602507489", "AffiliationID": "60011189, 60012718", "AffiliationName": "Division of Nuclear Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University"}, "6701368500": {"Name": "Vinjamuri S.", "AuthorID": "6701368500", "AffiliationID": "60023925", "AffiliationName": "Royal Liverpool University Hospital"}, "57216109256": {"Name": "Zumla A.", "AuthorID": "57216109256", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60176023", "AffiliationName": "Center for Clinical Microbiology, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, and the National Institute of Health Research Biomedical Research Centre at UCL Hospitals"}, "36477836600": {"Name": "Pascual T.N.B.", "AuthorID": "36477836600", "AffiliationID": "60022573, 60019311", "AffiliationName": "Section of Nuclear Medicine and Diagnostic Imaging, Division of Human Health, Department of Nuclear Sciences and Applications, International Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna International Centre"}}}
