Here, ultrasound acoustic time-of-flight (ToF) analysis is conducted under a range of operating conditions. Measurements are performed on a commercial pouch cell during varying discharge rates to identify a range of effects that influence the acoustic ToF measurements. The cell was examined using X-ray computed tomography to ensure no significant defects were present and to confirm the layered structure in the region being investigated, validating the signal pattern observed. Analyses of the acoustic signals obtained suggest that stresses are generated in the electrodes during both the charge and discharge of the cell with the magnitude of Young's modulus for the component materials being both a function of the state-of-charge and applied current. Characteristic responses for both electrodes during the charge/discharge cycle highlight the potential application of the technique as a real-time diagnostic tool.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Battery diagnostics", "Electrochemical stiffness", "Li-ion battery", "Ultrasound acoustics", "X-ray computed tomography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Charge and discharge", "Charge/discharge cycle", "Component materials", "Operating condition", "Real-time diagnostics", "Time-of-flight analysis", "Ultrasonic time of flights", "X-ray computed tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073598591", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55869997100": {"Name": "Robinson J.B.", "AuthorID": "55869997100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Diagnostics & Forensics Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, UCL"}, "57211356994": {"Name": "Pham M.", "AuthorID": "57211356994", "AffiliationID": "60172680", "AffiliationName": "The Faraday Institution, Quad One, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "56389335800": {"Name": "Kok M.D.R.", "AuthorID": "56389335800", "AffiliationID": "60172680", "AffiliationName": "The Faraday Institution, Quad One, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "57044825000": {"Name": "Heenan T.M.M.", "AuthorID": "57044825000", "AffiliationID": "60172680", "AffiliationName": "The Faraday Institution, Quad One, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.J.L.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60172680", "AffiliationName": "The Faraday Institution, Quad One, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.R.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60172680", "AffiliationName": "The Faraday Institution, Quad One, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}}}
