The best answer to that will be to move fast. But in a Union of law, where companies have an absolute right to defend themselves, there will always be limits to how fast we can move. This iswhy I expect that the decisionwe took a fewweeks ago, to impose interim measures on Broadcom, is a sign of things to come. Before last month, we last used interim measures in 2001. But I do not expect to wait another 18 years before we do it again.
