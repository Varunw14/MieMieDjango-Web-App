Child: Care, Health and Development published by John Wiley & Sons LtdBackground: The number of refugees worldwide has increased in recent years, and with this, there has been an increase in the numbers of unaccompanied asylum-seeking minors (UASMs) in the UK. Refugees have been found to experience notable difficulties upon resettlement, and there is evidence to suggest that education can provide a supportive role for young refugees. Although there has been research that has found that UASMs value education, there has been less research that has directly looked at the experiences of education for UASMs. Methods: In the present study, six UASMs were interviewed and interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) was used as a methodology to analyse the data. Results: Five themes were identified: education facilitating socializing; education and English proficiency leading to a better life in the UK; the impact of transitions; the impact of external stressors; and a desire for additional resources to learn at one's own pace. Conclusions: Participants within the present research expressed a strong desire for additional resources that would allow them to learn at their own pace. They also emphasized how transitions between different settings and external stressors had an impact on their experiences of education. The links between coping strategies and the participant's asylum status are also discussed with reference to relevant research in the field.", "AuthorKeywords": ["asylum", "education", "experience", "minors", "seeking", "unaccompanied"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082602447", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57216129024": {"Name": "Fuller M.", "AuthorID": "57216129024", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57216212555": {"Name": "Hayes B.", "AuthorID": "57216212555", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
