The procedure is challenging due to the mobility of the environment, poor visibility in amniotic fluid, occasional bleeding, and limitations in the fetoscopic field-of-view and image quality. Ideally, anastomotic placental vessels would be automatically identified, segmented and registered to create expanded vessel maps to guide laser ablation, however, such methods have yet to be clinically adopted. We propose a solution utilising the U-Net architecture for performing placental vessel segmentation in fetoscopic videos. The obtained vessel probability maps provide sufficient cues for mosaicking alignment by registering consecutive vessel maps using the direct intensity-based technique. Experiments on 6 different in vivo fetoscopic videos demonstrate that the vessel intensity-based registration outperformed image intensity-based registration approaches showing better robustness in qualitative and quantitative comparison. We additionally reduce drift accumulation to negligible even for sequences with up to 400 frames and we incorporate a scheme for quantifying drift error in the absence of the ground-truth. Our paper provides a benchmark for fetoscopy placental vessel segmentation and registration by contributing the first in vivo vessel segmentation and fetoscopic videos dataset.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deep learning", "Fetoscopy", "Mosaicking", "Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome", "Vessel registration", "Vessel segmentation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Image intensities", "Intensity-based registration", "Laser photocoagulation", "NET architecture", "Probability maps", "Quantitative comparison", "Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome", "Vessel segmentation"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089508709", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57217369168": {"Name": "Bano S.", "AuthorID": "57217369168", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences (WEISS) and Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "47862298300": {"Name": "Vasconcelos F.", "AuthorID": "47862298300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences (WEISS) and Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "57219443867": {"Name": "Shepherd L.M.", "AuthorID": "57219443867", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences (WEISS) and Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "57217833493": {"Name": "Stoyanov D.", "AuthorID": "57217833493", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences (WEISS) and Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "14029454500": {"Name": "Vander Poorten E.", "AuthorID": "14029454500", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, KU Leuven University"}, "23010613000": {"Name": "Vercauteren T.", "AuthorID": "23010613000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "7402605276": {"Name": "David A.L.", "AuthorID": "7402605276", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Fetal Medicine Unit, University College London Hospital"}, "55981137300": {"Name": "Deprest J.", "AuthorID": "55981137300", "AffiliationID": "60031069", "AffiliationName": "Department of Development and Regeneration, University Hospital Leuven"}}}
