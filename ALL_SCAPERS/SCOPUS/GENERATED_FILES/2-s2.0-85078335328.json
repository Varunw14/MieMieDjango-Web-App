MyPathway (NCT02091141), a phase IIa study, evaluates targeted therapies in non-indicated tumor types with actionable molecular alterations. Here, we present the efficacy and safety results for a subgroup of MyPathway patients with advanced salivary gland cancer (SGC) matched to targeted therapies based on tumor molecular characteristics. Patients and methods: MyPathway is an ongoing, multiple basket, open-label, non-randomized, multi-center study. Patients with advanced SGC received pertuzumab + trastuzumab (HER2 alteration), vismodegib (PTCH-1/SMO mutation), vemurafenib (BRAF V600 mutation), or atezolizumab [high tumor mutational burden (TMB)]. The primary endpoint is the objective response rate (ORR). Results: As of January 15, 2018, 19 patients with SGC were enrolled and treated in MyPathway (15 with HER2 amplification and/or overexpression and one each with a HER2 mutation without amplification or overexpression, PTCH-1 mutation, BRAF mutation, and high TMB). In the 15 patients with HER2 amplification/overexpression (with or without mutations) who were treated with pertuzumab + trastuzumab, 9 had an objective response (1 complete response, 8 partial responses) for an ORR of 60% (9.2 months median response duration). The clinical benefit rate (defined by patients with objective responses or stable disease >4 months) was 67% (10/15), median progression-free survival (PFS) was 8.6 months, and median overall survival was 20.4 months. Stable disease was observed in the patient with a HER2 mutation (pertuzumab + trastuzumab, n = 1/1, PFS 11.0 months), and partial responses in patients with the PTCH-1 mutation (vismodegib, n = 1/1, PFS 14.3 months), BRAF mutation (vemurafenib, n = 1/1, PFS 18.5 months), and high TMB (atezolizumab, n = 1/1, PFS 5.5+ months). No unexpected toxicity occurred. Conclusions: Overall, 12 of 19 patients (63%) with advanced SGC, treated with chemotherapy-free regimens matched to specific molecular alterations, experienced an objective response. Data from MyPathway suggest that matched targeted therapy for SGC has promising efficacy, supporting molecular profiling in treatment determination.", "AuthorKeywords": ["advanced salivary gland carcinoma", "HER2-positive", "molecular profiling", "pertuzumab", "targeted therapy", "trastuzumab"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Breast Neoplasms", "Carcinoma", "Humans", "Molecular Targeted Therapy", "Receptor, ErbB-2", "Salivary Gland Neoplasms", "Salivary Glands", "Trastuzumab"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078335328", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"7102224432": {"Name": "Kurzrock R.", "AuthorID": "7102224432", "AffiliationID": "60086300, 60030612", "AffiliationName": "Moores Cancer Center, UC San Diego"}, "14419744200": {"Name": "Bowles D.W.", "AuthorID": "14419744200", "AffiliationID": "60028392", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Denver"}, "57213216054": {"Name": "Kang H.", "AuthorID": "57213216054", "AffiliationID": "60021212, 60001117", "AffiliationName": "Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"}, "7401560620": {"Name": "Meric-Bernstam F.", "AuthorID": "7401560620", "AffiliationID": "60015023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center"}, "7102972135": {"Name": "Hainsworth J.", "AuthorID": "7102972135", "AffiliationID": "121965883", "AffiliationName": "Tennessee Oncology, PLLC"}, "57203082732": {"Name": "Spigel D.R.", "AuthorID": "57203082732", "AffiliationID": "121965883", "AffiliationName": "Tennessee Oncology, PLLC"}, "7006835704": {"Name": "Burris H.", "AuthorID": "7006835704", "AffiliationID": "121965883", "AffiliationName": "Tennessee Oncology, PLLC"}, "7101769165": {"Name": "Bose R.", "AuthorID": "7101769165", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "7102862991": {"Name": "Sweeney C.J.", "AuthorID": "7102862991", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60014334", "AffiliationName": "Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School"}, "56976660300": {"Name": "Beattie M.S.", "AuthorID": "56976660300", "AffiliationID": "60026209", "AffiliationName": "Department of Product Development, Medical Affairs, Genentech, Inc."}, "57214991067": {"Name": "Blotner S.", "AuthorID": "57214991067", "AffiliationID": "60026209", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics, Genentech, Inc."}, "57195252246": {"Name": "Schulze K.", "AuthorID": "57195252246", "AffiliationID": "60026209", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology Biomarker Development, Genentech, Inc."}, "25644424200": {"Name": "Cuchelkar V.", "AuthorID": "25644424200", "AffiliationID": "60026209", "AffiliationName": "Department of BioOncology, Genentech, Inc."}, "7005912775": {"Name": "Swanton C.", "AuthorID": "7005912775", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Department of Tumour Biology, Francis Crick Institute"}}}
