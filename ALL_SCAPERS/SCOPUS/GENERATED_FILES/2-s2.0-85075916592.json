To understand their implications, in this paper, data-intensive approaches for sustainability will be explored by conducting an extensive review. The current data-intensive approaches are defined as an amalgamation of traditional data-collection methods, such as surveys and data from monitoring networks, with new data-collection methods that involve new information communication technology. Based on a comprehensive review of the current data-intensive approaches for sustainability, key challenges are identified: the lack of data availability, diverse indicators developed from a narrowly viewed base, diverse definitions and values, skewed global representation, and the lack of social and economic information collected, especially among the business indicators. To clarify the implications of these trends, four major research assumptions regarding data-intensive approaches are elaborated: the methodology, epistemology, normativity, and ontology. Caution is required when data-intensive approaches are masked as \u201cobjective\u201d. Overcoming this issue requires interdisciplinary and community-based approaches that can offer ways to address the subjectivities of data-intensive approaches. The current challenges to interdisciplinarity and community-based approaches are also identified, and possible solutions are explored, so that researchers can employ them to make the best use of data-intensive approaches.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Big data", "Data-intensive approaches", "Open data", "Planetary boundary", "SDGs", "Sustainability", "Sustainability indicators"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075916592", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Nature and Landscape Conservation", "ENVI", "2309"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"57193955357": {"Name": "Asokan V.A.", "AuthorID": "57193955357", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Graduate Program in Sustainability Science, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo"}, "23037745200": {"Name": "Yarime M.", "AuthorID": "23037745200", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Public Policy, The University of Tokyo"}, "7007032725": {"Name": "Onuki M.", "AuthorID": "7007032725", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Graduate Program in Sustainability Science (GPSS), Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, University of Tokyo"}}}
