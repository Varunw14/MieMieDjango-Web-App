Early detection and diagnosis would allow for prompt institution of isolation from infection and referral for definitive treatment with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Universal newborn screening for SCID, using an assay to detect T-cell receptor excision circles (TREC) in dried blood spots (DBS), is now being performed in all states in the United States. In this review, we discuss the development and outcomes of TREC screening, and continued challenges to implementation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation", "newborn screening", "public health", "severe combined immunodeficiency", "T lymphocytes"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072894435", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"56173899300": {"Name": "van der Burg M.", "AuthorID": "56173899300", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Immunology, Department of Pediatrics, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "12769685400": {"Name": "Mahlaoui N.", "AuthorID": "12769685400", "AffiliationID": "60026877, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Centre de R\u00e9f\u00e9rence D\u00e9ficits Immunitaires H\u00e9r\u00e9ditaires, H\u00f4pital Universitaire Necker-Enfants Malades, Assistance Publique-H\u00f4pitaux de Paris"}, "7003891382": {"Name": "Gaspar H.B.", "AuthorID": "7003891382", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Molecular and Cellular Immunology, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7202022897": {"Name": "Pai S.Y.", "AuthorID": "7202022897", "AffiliationID": "60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
