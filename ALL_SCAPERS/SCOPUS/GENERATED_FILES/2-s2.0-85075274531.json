All three methods conditionally show hints of an oscillatory feature in the primordial power spectrum in the multipole range \u223c20 to \u223c50, which is to some extent preserved upon marginalization. We find no evidence for deviations from a pure power law across a broad observable window (50 2000), but find that parametrizations are preferred which are able to account for lack of resolution at large angular scales due to cosmic variance, and at small angular scales due to Planck instrument noise. Furthermore, the late-time cosmological parameters are unperturbed by these extensions to the primordial power spectrum. This work is intended to provide a background and give more details of the Bayesian primordial reconstruction work found in the Planck 2018 papers.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075274531", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"57211599215": {"Name": "Handley W.J.", "AuthorID": "57211599215", "AffiliationID": "60091913", "AffiliationName": "Gonville and Caius College"}, "7005763897": {"Name": "Lasenby A.N.", "AuthorID": "7005763897", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Kavli Institute for Cosmology"}, "7005651121": {"Name": "Hobson M.P.", "AuthorID": "7005651121", "AffiliationID": "60121115", "AffiliationName": "Astrophysics Group, Cavendish Laboratory"}, "23991274600": {"Name": "Peiris H.V.", "AuthorID": "23991274600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
