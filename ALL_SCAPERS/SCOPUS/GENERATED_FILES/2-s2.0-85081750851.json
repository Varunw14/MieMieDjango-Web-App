This process of shealing, of re-making and making lives liveable, is a process of assembling, or trying to assemble, life and livelihoods, without necessarily immediately eradicating all traces of destruction which might be vestiges of a life before the disastrous manifestation of compound vulnerabilities. Shealing provides an alternative to assumptive, linear approaches in order to enfold healing and vulnerability reduction within day-to-day, continual, accepted, non-spectacular actions. From a noun or an attribute, \u201cshealing\u201d functions as a verb by being a continuous and open-ended process in the present, not just a defined stage, whether a hoped-for endpoint or a recovery of some pre-disaster state. Shealing allows theorising the many ways of living in and through disaster experiences alongside the range of everyday post-disaster approaches to re-making one's life that an individual or community might embrace. Shealing forms a joint scholarly-practical approach that better addresses what needs to be done and accepted after experiencing a disaster. This paper focuses on disasters, but wider implications and connections emerge, such as for grief, trauma, and social work.", "AuthorKeywords": ["disasters", "hazards", "healing", "recovery", "resilience", "vulnerability"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081750851", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"]], "AuthorData": {"57205430962": {"Name": "Mika K.", "AuthorID": "57205430962", "AffiliationID": "60004442", "AffiliationName": "Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies (KITLV)"}, "23390064600": {"Name": "Kelman I.", "AuthorID": "23390064600", "AffiliationID": "60080184", "AffiliationName": "University of Agder"}}}
