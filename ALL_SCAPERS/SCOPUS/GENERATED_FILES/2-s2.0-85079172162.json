Antipsychotic blood levels are influenced by cytochrome P450 enzymes, primarily CYP2D6. Variation in CYP450 genes may affect the risk of antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess whether CYP2D6 functional genetic variants are associated with antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia. The systematic review identified 16 relevant papers, seven of which were suitable for the meta-analysis (n = 303 participants including 134 extreme metabolisers). Participants were classified into four phenotype groups as poor, intermediate, extensive, and ultra-rapid metabolisers. A random effects meta-analysis was used and Cohen\u2019s d calculated as the effect size for each primary study. We found no significant differences in prolactin levels between CYP2D6 metabolic groups. Current evidence does not support using CYP2D6 genotyping to reduce risk of antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia. However, statistical power is limited. Future studies with larger samples and including a range of prolactin-elevating drugs are needed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079172162", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"57205620576": {"Name": "Calafato M.S.", "AuthorID": "57205620576", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Neuroscience Research Department, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "57214801812": {"Name": "Austin-Zimmerman I.", "AuthorID": "57214801812", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Neuroscience Research Department, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "42162169300": {"Name": "Thygesen J.H.", "AuthorID": "42162169300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}, "6506196094": {"Name": "Metastasio A.", "AuthorID": "6506196094", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Neuroscience Research Department, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "57214801434": {"Name": "Bhat A.", "AuthorID": "57214801434", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Neuroscience Research Department, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "57214795159": {"Name": "Harju-Sepp\u00e4nen J.", "AuthorID": "57214795159", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Neuroscience Research Department, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "24528118700": {"Name": "Irizar H.", "AuthorID": "24528118700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Neuroscience Research Department, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "57196455458": {"Name": "Zartaloudi E.", "AuthorID": "57196455458", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Neuroscience Research Department, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "57216064872": {"Name": "Bramon E.", "AuthorID": "57216064872", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "57214807247": {"Name": "Sairam M.", "AuthorID": "57214807247", "AffiliationID": "60162122", "AffiliationName": "Romsey Community Mental Health Team, Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603627308": {"Name": "Marston L.", "AuthorID": "6603627308", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "6603835749": {"Name": "Abad-Santos F.", "AuthorID": "6603835749", "AffiliationID": "60024257, 60106503, 60105312, 60026796", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Pharmacology Department, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, Instituto Te\u00f3filo Hernando, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid, Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n Sanitaria Princesa (IP)"}}}
