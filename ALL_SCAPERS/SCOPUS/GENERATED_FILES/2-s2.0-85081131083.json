Weighted CMTNS and CMTES modified category responses were developed with Rasch analysis of the standard scores. Change from baseline for CMTNS-R and CMTES-R was estimated with longitudinal regression models.ResultsBaseline CMTNS-R and CMTES-R scores were available for 517 and 1,177 participants, respectively. Mean \u00b1 SD age of participants with available CMTES-R scores was 41 \u00b1 18 (range 4-87) years, and 56% were female. Follow-up CMTES-R assessments at 1, 2, and 3 years were available for 377, 321, and 244 patients. A mixed regression model showed significant change in CMTES-R score at years 2 through 6 compared to baseline (mean change from baseline 0.59 points at 2 years, p = 0.0004, n = 321). Compared to the original CMTES, the CMTES-R revealed a 55% improvement in the standardized response mean (mean change/SD change) at 2 years (0.17 vs 0.11). Change in CMTES-R at 2 years was greatest in mildly to moderately affected patients (1.48-point mean change, 95% confidence interval 0.99-1.97, p < 0.0001, for baseline CMTES-R score 0-9).ConclusionThe CMTES-R demonstrates change over time in patients with CMT1A and is more sensitive than the original CMTES. The CMTES-R was most sensitive to change in patients with mild to moderate baseline disease severity and failed to capture progression in patients with severe CMT1A.ClinicalTrials.gov
