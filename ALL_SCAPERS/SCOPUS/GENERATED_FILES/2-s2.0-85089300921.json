UGTs have shown promise as catalysts in the synthesis of glycosides for medical treatment. However, limited understanding at the molecular level due to insufficient biochemical and structural information has hindered potential applications of most of these UGTs. In the absence of experimental crystal structures, we employed advanced molecular modeling and simulations in conjunction with biochemical characterization to design a workflow to study five Group H Arabidopsis thaliana (76E1, 76E2, 76E4, 76E5, 76D1) UGTs. Based on our rational structural manipulation and analysis, we identified key amino acids (P129 in 76D1; D374 in 76E2; K275 in 76E4), which when mutated improved donor substrate recognition than wildtype UGTs. Molecular dynamics simulations and deep learning analysis identified structural differences, which drive substrate preferences. The design of these UGTs with broader substrate specificity may play important role in biotechnological and industrial applications. These findings can also serve as basis to study other plant UGTs and thereby advancing UGT enzyme engineering.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089300921", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57203723070": {"Name": "Akere A.", "AuthorID": "57203723070", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Pharmaceutical and Biological Chemistry, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "57218483656": {"Name": "Liu X.", "AuthorID": "57218483656", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Pharmaceutical and Biological Chemistry, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "57196221455": {"Name": "Haider S.", "AuthorID": "57196221455", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Pharmaceutical and Biological Chemistry, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "57218484273": {"Name": "Chen S.H.", "AuthorID": "57218484273", "AffiliationID": "60024266", "AffiliationName": "Computational Sciences and Engineering Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory"}, "55350242500": {"Name": "Bhowmik D.", "AuthorID": "55350242500", "AffiliationID": "60024266", "AffiliationName": "Computational Sciences and Engineering Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory"}, "35182743900": {"Name": "Chen Y.", "AuthorID": "35182743900", "AffiliationID": "60029885", "AffiliationName": "College of Life Science, Sichuan Agricultural University"}, "57190171446": {"Name": "Dantu S.C.", "AuthorID": "57190171446", "AffiliationID": "60020623", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Brunel University London"}, "15822693900": {"Name": "Pandini A.", "AuthorID": "15822693900", "AffiliationID": "60020623", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Brunel University London"}}}
