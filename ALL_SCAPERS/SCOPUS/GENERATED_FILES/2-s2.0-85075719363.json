Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Objective: To provide a new perspective on integrated biomedical and psychosocial dementia research. Background: Dementia is being recognized as a multifactorial syndrome, but there is little interaction between biomedical and psychosocial approaches. A way to improve scientific knowledge is to seek better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the interaction between biomedical and psychosocial paradigms. One rationale for integrating biomedical and psychosocial research is the discordance between neuropathology and cognitive functioning. The concept of social health might bridge the two paradigms. It relates to how social resources influence the dynamic balance between capacities and limitations. Hypotheses: Social health can act as the driver for accessing cognitive reserve, in people with dementia through active facilitation and utilization of social and environmental resources. Thereby we link lifestyle social and opportunities to the brain reserve hypothesis. Manifesto: We provide a Manifesto on how to significantly move forward the dementia research agenda.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cognitive functioning", "Dementia and cognitive disorders", "psychological and social aspects", "psychosocial interventions", "social support"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075719363", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatric Mental Health", "NURS", "2921"], ["Gerontology", "NURS", "2909"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7004246935": {"Name": "Vernooij-Dassen M.", "AuthorID": "7004246935", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Scientific Institute for Quality of Healthcare (IQ Healthcare), Radboud University Medical Center"}, "6603716658": {"Name": "Moniz-Cook E.", "AuthorID": "6603716658", "AffiliationID": "60030469", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health Sciences, School of Health Social Work, University of Hull"}, "7007057244": {"Name": "Verhey F.", "AuthorID": "7007057244", "AffiliationID": "60007895", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Centrum Limburg, School of Mental Health Neurosciences/Psychiatry and Psychology/MUMC"}, "6602946090": {"Name": "Chattat R.", "AuthorID": "6602946090", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Bologna"}, "7101638963": {"Name": "Woods B.", "AuthorID": "7101638963", "AffiliationID": "60025779", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Services Development Centre, DSDC Wales, Bangor University"}, "6701407422": {"Name": "Meiland F.", "AuthorID": "6701407422", "AffiliationID": "60001157, 60117142, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, APH Research Institute"}, "6602230662": {"Name": "Franco M.", "AuthorID": "6602230662", "AffiliationID": "123524066", "AffiliationName": "Psychiatric and Mental Health Department, University Rio Hortega Hospital and Zamora Hospital"}, "23060113500": {"Name": "Holmerova I.", "AuthorID": "23060113500", "AffiliationID": "60016605", "AffiliationName": "Charles University FHS CELLO and Gerontologicke Centrum"}, "7006161600": {"Name": "Orrell M.", "AuthorID": "7006161600", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60172395", "AffiliationName": "The Institute of Mental Health, University of Nottingham Innovation Park"}, "7801535173": {"Name": "de Vugt M.", "AuthorID": "7801535173", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Center Limburg, School for Mental Health and Neurosciences, Maastricht University"}}}
