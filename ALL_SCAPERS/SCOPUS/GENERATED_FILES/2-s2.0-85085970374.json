Anthropology Today published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Royal Anthropological InstituteIn times of crisis, inequalities are more commonly exaggerated than ameliorated \u2013 meaning both that vulnerable populations are often forced to make do with what resources are at hand and that many of those who barely manage in \u2018normal\u2019 times are pushed beyond capability and opportunity thresholds. Indeed, new case definitions of vulnerability that emerge in a crisis may push previously unrecognized groups (e.g. service employees, \u2018care\u2019 facility residents) into extreme vulnerability, as borderline coping quickly becomes calamity coping. To understand emerging vulnerability, it is therefore critical for social scientists to have a seat at the table where scarce resources are being allocated \u2013 before, during and after a crisis.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085970374", "SubjectAreas": [["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"]], "AuthorData": {"7006653102": {"Name": "Napier A.D.", "AuthorID": "7006653102", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL)"}}}
