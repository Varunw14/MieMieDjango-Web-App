To what extent this type of behavioral adaptation might develop during childhood and adolescence and differ during aging remains unclear. We therefore tested 247 healthy individuals across the human life span (7\u201380 years) with an orthogonalized valenced go/no-go learning task. Computational modeling revealed that peak performance in young adults was attributable to greater sensitivity to both reward and punishment. However, in children and adolescents, we observed an increased bias toward action but not reward sensitivity. By contrast, reduced learning in midlife and older adults was accompanied by decreased reward sensitivity and especially punishment sensitivity along with an age-related increase in the Pavlovian bias. These findings reveal distinct motivation-dependent learning capabilities across the human life span, which cannot be probed using conventional go/reward no-go/punishment style paradigms that have important implications in lifelong education.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Action", "Instrumental learning", "Lifespan", "Pavlovian bias", "Reward"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090573394", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"36840399500": {"Name": "Betts M.J.", "AuthorID": "36840399500", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Center for Behavioral Brain Sciences, University of Magdeburg"}, "6701771740": {"Name": "D\u00fczel E.", "AuthorID": "6701771740", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "57203992614": {"Name": "Perosa V.", "AuthorID": "57203992614", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neurology and Dementia Research, Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg"}, "6701740398": {"Name": "Seidenbecher C.", "AuthorID": "6701740398", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurochemistry and Molecular Biology"}, "7006476904": {"Name": "Schott B.H.", "AuthorID": "7006476904", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}, "6602299060": {"Name": "Krauel K.", "AuthorID": "6602299060", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Otto von Guericke University"}, "55750056300": {"Name": "Richter A.", "AuthorID": "55750056300", "AffiliationID": "60020075", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioral Neurology, Leibniz Institute for Neurobiology"}, "56397878100": {"Name": "de Boer L.", "AuthorID": "56397878100", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Aging Research Centre, Karolinska Institute"}, "12781497100": {"Name": "Guitart-Masip M.", "AuthorID": "12781497100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60122566", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research, University College London"}, "56509526800": {"Name": "Tegelbeckers J.", "AuthorID": "56509526800", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Otto von Guericke University"}, "57218883152": {"Name": "Baumann V.", "AuthorID": "57218883152", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Otto von Guericke University"}, "55212829600": {"Name": "Chowdhury R.", "AuthorID": "55212829600", "AffiliationID": "60012508", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Teaching Hospital NHS Trust"}, "55027467100": {"Name": "Dolan R.J.", "AuthorID": "55027467100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60122566", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research, University College London"}}}
