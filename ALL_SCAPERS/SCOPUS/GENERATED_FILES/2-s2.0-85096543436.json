In particular, it remains extremely challenging to construct \u03c0-conjugated systems that emit in the red region of the electromagnetic spectrum and also retain their optical properties and intense photoluminescence in the solid state. In this article we report the synthesis and characterization of three novel diketopyrrolopyrrole-based conjugated polymers, with systematic variation of the covalent encapsulation density. Through control of the distance and density of encapsulation, our red-emitting polymers demonstrate that aggregation-caused quenching can be mostly eliminated, culminating in the most efficient solid-state photoluminescence from red conjugated polymers to date.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Based conjugated polymers", "Diketopyrrolopyrroles", "Electromagnetic spectra", "Pi-conjugated system", "Red-emitting", "Solid state emission", "Synthesis and characterizations", "Systematic variation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096543436", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57200617612": {"Name": "Royakkers J.", "AuthorID": "57200617612", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "57193916579": {"Name": "Congrave D.G.", "AuthorID": "57193916579", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "56417050900": {"Name": "Zeng W.", "AuthorID": "56417050900", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "57195957289": {"Name": "Leventis A.", "AuthorID": "57195957289", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "24477074800": {"Name": "Bronstein H.", "AuthorID": "24477074800", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "55840747800": {"Name": "Minotto A.", "AuthorID": "55840747800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy and Lcn, University College London"}, "57220773974": {"Name": "Hassan A.", "AuthorID": "57220773974", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy and Lcn, University College London"}, "7006071546": {"Name": "Cacialli F.", "AuthorID": "7006071546", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy and Lcn, University College London"}}}
