Mutations in CUL4B result in Cabezas syndrome (CS). Male CS patients present with dysmorphic, neuropsychiatric, genitourinary, and endocrine abnormalities. Heterozygous CS females are clinically asymptomatic. LAMP2 mutations cause Danon disease (DD). Cardiomyopathy is a dominant feature of DD present in both males and heterozygous females. No monogenic phenotypes have been associated with mutations in ATP1B4, TMEM255A, and ZBTB33 genes. To facilitate diagnostics and counseling in CS and DD families, we present a female DD patient with a de novo Alu-mediated Xq24 rearrangement causing a deletion encompassing CUL4B, LAMP2, and also the other three neighboring genes. Typical to females heterozygous for CUL4B mutations, the patient was CS asymptomatic, however, presented with extremely skewed X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) ratios in peripheral white blood cells. As a result of the likely selection against CUL4B deficient clones, only minimal populations (~3%) of LAMP2 deficient leukocytes were identified by flow cytometry. On the contrary, myocardial LAMP2 protein expression suggested random XCI. We demonstrate that contiguous CUL4B and LAMP2 loss-of-function copy number variations occur and speculate that male patients carrying similar defects could present with features of both CS and DD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cabezas syndrome", "cullin 4B", "Danon disease", "female heterozygotes", "lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Alu Elements", "Cardiomyopathies", "Chromosome Deletion", "Cullin Proteins", "DNA Copy Number Variations", "Exons", "Female", "Glycogen Storage Disease Type IIb", "Humans", "Loss of Function Mutation", "Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 2", "Male", "Mental Retardation, X-Linked", "Myocardium", "Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase", "Transcription Factors", "X Chromosome Inactivation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075209785", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"12792951700": {"Name": "Majer F.", "AuthorID": "12792951700", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Research Unit for Rare Diseases, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, 1st Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and General University Hospital"}, "57193414772": {"Name": "Kousal B.", "AuthorID": "57193414772", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, 1st Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and General University Hospital"}, "23973623500": {"Name": "Piherova L.", "AuthorID": "23973623500", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Research Unit for Rare Diseases, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, 1st Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and General University Hospital"}, "56605028700": {"Name": "Reboun M.", "AuthorID": "56605028700", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Research Unit for Rare Diseases, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, 1st Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and General University Hospital"}, "6503896226": {"Name": "Vlaskova H.", "AuthorID": "6503896226", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Research Unit for Rare Diseases, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, 1st Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and General University Hospital"}, "57193618126": {"Name": "Dvorakova L.", "AuthorID": "57193618126", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Research Unit for Rare Diseases, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, 1st Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and General University Hospital"}, "14119954300": {"Name": "Liskova P.", "AuthorID": "14119954300", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, 1st Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and General University Hospital"}, "6602555812": {"Name": "Kmoch S.", "AuthorID": "6602555812", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Research Unit for Rare Diseases, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, 1st Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and General University Hospital"}, "8918181100": {"Name": "Sikora J.", "AuthorID": "8918181100", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pathology, 1st Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and General University Hospital"}, "10042636600": {"Name": "Dusek P.", "AuthorID": "10042636600", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, 1st Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and General University Hospital"}, "24177338000": {"Name": "Mihalova R.", "AuthorID": "24177338000", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biology and Medical Genetics, 1st Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and General University Hospital"}, "57201201232": {"Name": "Gurka J.", "AuthorID": "57201201232", "AffiliationID": "60020529", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine"}, "6602915422": {"Name": "Krebsova A.", "AuthorID": "6602915422", "AffiliationID": "60020529", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine"}, "9640371700": {"Name": "Kubanek M.", "AuthorID": "9640371700", "AffiliationID": "60020529", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine"}, "57211874008": {"Name": "Krihova J.", "AuthorID": "57211874008", "AffiliationID": "106269776", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Thomayer Hospital"}, "8501653200": {"Name": "Kalina T.", "AuthorID": "8501653200", "AffiliationID": "60023469, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol"}}}
