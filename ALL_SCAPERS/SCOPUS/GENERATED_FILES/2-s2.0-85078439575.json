ACM ISBN 978-1-4503-7225-1/19/11\u2026$15.00Immersive technologies are becoming increasingly popular in a wide range of fields from gaming to therapy. While there is a high number of case studies in education with promising results in terms of students' performance and engagement, there has still not been widespread adoption. Indeed, more research focused on large-size samples, assessing and discussing the effects on the medium and large term is required, as well as comparisons among different hardware and software, and guidelines for instructors that want to introduce these technologies in their classrooms. In this paper, we focus on the use of immersive technologies applications in higher education. In particular, we explain the basics of immersive technologies, review the main applications in higher education, discuss benefits and challenges, and describe good practices for instructors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Learning & ICT", "Students' engagement", "Virtual reality"], "IndexKeywords": ["Case-studies", "Good practices", "Hardware and software", "Higher education", "Immersive technologies", "Students' engagements"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078439575", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"57119537500": {"Name": "Calvet L.", "AuthorID": "57119537500", "AffiliationID": "60134854", "AffiliationName": "\u00c1rea de empresa, Universidad Internacional de Valencia Valencia"}, "55918399600": {"Name": "Bourdin P.", "AuthorID": "55918399600", "AffiliationID": "60001576", "AffiliationName": "Eventlab, Edifici Teatre, Departament de Psicologia Cl\u00ednica i Psicobiologia, Universitat de Barcelona"}, "57193550334": {"Name": "Prados F.", "AuthorID": "57193550334", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering Department, University College London"}}}
