S-phase length is determined by DNA synthesis rate, which depends on the number of active replication forks and their velocity. Here, we show that E2F-dependent transcription, through E2F6, determines the replication capacity of a cell, defined as the maximal amount of DNA a cell can synthesise per unit time during S-phase. Increasing or decreasing E2F-dependent transcription during S-phase increases or decreases replication capacity, and thereby replication rates, thus shortening or lengthening S-phase, respectively. The changes in replication rate occur mainly through changes in fork speed without affecting the number of active forks. An increase in fork speed does not induce replication stress directly, but increases DNA damage over time causing cell cycle arrest. Thus, E2F-dependent transcription determines the DNA replication capacity of a cell, which affects the replication rate, controlling the time it takes to duplicate the genome and complete S-phase.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Blotting, Western", "Chromatin", "DNA Damage", "DNA Replication", "E2F Transcription Factors", "Flow Cytometry", "Fluorescent Antibody Technique", "Humans", "S Phase", "Transcription Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087940463", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57189260493": {"Name": "Pennycook B.R.", "AuthorID": "57189260493", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC London Institute of Medical Science Hammersmith Hospital Campus"}, "23089635300": {"Name": "Vesela E.", "AuthorID": "23089635300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "57218127683": {"Name": "Peripolli S.", "AuthorID": "57218127683", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "7403106241": {"Name": "Singh T.", "AuthorID": "7403106241", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "15070521300": {"Name": "Bertoli C.", "AuthorID": "15070521300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "7006222988": {"Name": "de Bruin R.A.M.", "AuthorID": "7006222988", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "8549827200": {"Name": "Barr A.R.", "AuthorID": "8549827200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Sciences, Imperial College London"}}}
