Recent experimental data suggest that these gradients, which may result from heterogeneities in the velocity field or consumption in the tissue, may in fact be important. Here, we study the validity of the well-mixed hypothesis in network models of solute transport using theoretical and computational approaches. We focus on regimes of weak coupling where the transport problem inside the vasculature is independent of the concentration field in the tissue. In these regimes, the boundary condition between vessels and tissue can be modelled by a Robin boundary condition. For this boundary condition and for a single cylindrical capillary, we derive a one-dimensional cross-section average transport problem with dispersion and exchange coefficients capturing the effects of radial gradients. We then extend this model to a network of connected tubes and solve the problem in a complex anatomical network. By comparing with results based on the well-mixed hypothesis, we find that dispersive effects are a fundamental component of transport in transient situations with relatively rapid injections, i.e. frequencies above one Hertz. For slowly varying signals and steady states, radial gradients also significantly impact the spatial distribution of vessel/tissue exchange for molecules that easily cross the blood brain barrier. This suggests that radial gradients cannot be systematically neglected and that there is a crucial need to determine the impact of spatiooral heterogeneities on transport in the brain microcirculation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["blood flow", "porous media"], "IndexKeywords": ["Blood flow", "Computational approach", "Concentration fields", "Cylindrical capillaries", "Exchange coefficients", "Fundamental component", "Robin boundary conditions", "Transient situations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076679323", "SubjectAreas": [["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"57205738258": {"Name": "Berg M.", "AuthorID": "57205738258", "AffiliationID": "60102124, 60001879, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "Institut de M\u00e9canique des Fluides de Toulouse, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, CNRS"}, "36105048900": {"Name": "Davit Y.", "AuthorID": "36105048900", "AffiliationID": "60102124, 60001879, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "Institut de M\u00e9canique des Fluides de Toulouse, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, CNRS"}, "55708600000": {"Name": "Quintard M.", "AuthorID": "55708600000", "AffiliationID": "60102124, 60001879, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "Institut de M\u00e9canique des Fluides de Toulouse, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, CNRS"}, "6602641444": {"Name": "Lorthois S.", "AuthorID": "6602641444", "AffiliationID": "60102124, 60001879, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "Institut de M\u00e9canique des Fluides de Toulouse, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, CNRS"}}}
