Whilst studies have shown local variation in degradation rates using electrochemical techniques, this work employs identical-location X-ray CT imaging to elucidate the local degradation of a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) at various locations along-the-channel of a serpentine flow field. Using a carbon corrosion specific accelerated stress test (AST), in-depth analyses of the catalyst layers (CLs) and crack network allow for quantification of the material's degradation at the inlet, middle and outlet regions of the flow channel on the cathode side. Imaging of the regions was done after 0, 2000 and 5000 cycles and results show significant regional variation in the extent of degradation of the cathode CL. The order of degradation was found to be outlet > middle > inlet, with the outlet CL found to be thinner than the middle and inlet regions, with a greater extent of cracking. Furthermore, additional land and channel degradation effects were probed, with the land regions found to be less degraded than channel regions. This work further highlights the need to understand and develop ASTs that can promote a more uniform degradation rate across an MEA.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Accelerated stress test", "Carbon corrosion", "Local degradation", "Membrane electrode assembly", "Polymer electrolyte fuel cell", "X-ray computed tomography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Channel degradations", "Constituent materials", "Electrochemical techniques", "Membrane electrode assemblies", "Polymer electrolyte fuel cells", "Regional variation", "Serpentine flow fields", "X-ray computed tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085575904", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Electrochemistry", "CHEM", "1603"]], "AuthorData": {"57202026518": {"Name": "Hack J.", "AuthorID": "57202026518", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57201197910": {"Name": "Rasha L.", "AuthorID": "57201197910", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57212442242": {"Name": "Cullen P.L.", "AuthorID": "57212442242", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Materials Science (SEMS) and Material Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57189988046": {"Name": "Bailey J.J.", "AuthorID": "57189988046", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "54962772600": {"Name": "Neville T.P.", "AuthorID": "54962772600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.R.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.J.L.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005362989": {"Name": "Brandon N.P.", "AuthorID": "7005362989", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences and Engineering, Royal School of Mines, Imperial College London"}}}
