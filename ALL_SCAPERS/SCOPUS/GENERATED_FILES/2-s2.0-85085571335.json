After the introduction of direct laser metal sintering (DLMS) 3D printing technology and its use over conventional machine-cut processes, questions remain regarding whether 3D-printed titanium (alloy) devices have similar biological properties to machine-cut counterparts for dental applications. Thus, this work focuses on comparing the biological activities of machine-cut and 3D-printed specimens after optimizing the DLMS 3D-printing conditions in terms of the mechanophysical characteristics. Methods: The DLMS 3D-printing (as a function of the laser spacing from 30\u2013100 \u03bcm) and post-surface treatment (as-given or sand-blasted) conditions were optimized using medical-grade Ti-6Al-4V powders in terms of the inner pore amount, mechanical properties, roughness and hydrophilicity. Then, the initial cell adhesion of the optimized DLMS 3D-printed Ti-6Al-4V specimen was compared with that of the machine-cut Ti-6Al-4V specimen against human dermal fibroblasts (hDFs) and mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), which are representative of direct-contact cell types of orofacial mucosa and bone, respectively. hMSC differentiation on the specimens was conducted for up to 21 days to measure the osteogenic gene expression and biomineralization. Results: Laser spacings of 30\u201340 \u03bcm had fewer inner defects and consequently a higher three-point flexural strength and elastic modulus compared to other larger laser spacings. Depending on the span width (0.3\u20131 mm) in the lattice architecture, the elastic modulus of the 3D-printed cuboid specimen can be further controlled (up to \u223c30 times). The sand-blasted specimens after 3D printing revealed lower surface roughness and higher hydrophilicity compared to the as-3D printed specimen, which were considered optimal conditions for biological study. Initial hDF and hMSC adhesion for 12 hr and hMSC differentiation on the surface were comparable between the sand-blasted 3D-printed and machine-cut specimens in terms of adherent cell numbers, vinculin intensity, osteogenic gene expression and biomineralization. Significance: The optimized DLMS 3D-printed Ti-6Al-4V specimen had similar biological properties to those of the machine-cut counterpart, suggesting the potential usefulness of 3D printing technology for a wide range of dental applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D printing", "Dental application", "Osteogenesis", "Titanium alloy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biological properties", "Biological studies", "Conventional machines", "Dental applications", "Direct laser metal sintering", "Human dermal fibroblasts", "Mesenchymal stem cell", "Three-point flexural strength", "Alloys", "Biocompatible Materials", "Humans", "Materials Testing", "Osteogenesis", "Printing, Three-Dimensional", "Surface Properties", "Titanium"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085571335", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"]], "AuthorData": {"57211020058": {"Name": "Kim J.H.", "AuthorID": "57211020058", "AffiliationID": "60002877", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nanobiomedical Science & BK21 PLUS NBM Global Research Center for Regenerative Medicine Research Center, Dankook University"}, "57211729840": {"Name": "Kim H.W.", "AuthorID": "57211729840", "AffiliationID": "60002877", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nanobiomedical Science & BK21 PLUS NBM Global Research Center for Regenerative Medicine Research Center, Dankook University"}, "57202882008": {"Name": "Lee J.H.", "AuthorID": "57202882008", "AffiliationID": "60002877", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nanobiomedical Science & BK21 PLUS NBM Global Research Center for Regenerative Medicine Research Center, Dankook University"}, "57216969065": {"Name": "Lee H.H.", "AuthorID": "57216969065", "AffiliationID": "60170569, 60002877", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Tissue Regeneration Engineering (ITREN), Dankook University"}, "57183215600": {"Name": "Kim M.Y.", "AuthorID": "57183215600", "AffiliationID": "60170568", "AffiliationName": "Department of oral and maxillofacial surgery, College of Dentistry, Dankook University"}, "57201615930": {"Name": "Park S.M.", "AuthorID": "57201615930", "AffiliationID": "60002877", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nanobiomedical Science & BK21 PLUS NBM Global Research Center for Regenerative Medicine Research Center, Dankook University"}, "26643634100": {"Name": "Knowles J.C.", "AuthorID": "26643634100", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Discoveries Centre for Regenerative and Precision Medicine, Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "57216971089": {"Name": "Choi S.", "AuthorID": "57216971089", "AffiliationID": "60170568", "AffiliationName": "Department of Prosthodontics, Sejong Dental Hospital, School of Dentistry, Dankook University, Sejong"}, "57204943599": {"Name": "Kang H.", "AuthorID": "57204943599", "AffiliationID": "60170568", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthodontics, Sejong Dental Hospital, School of Dentistry, Dankook University, Sejong"}, "57216971513": {"Name": "Park S.h.", "AuthorID": "57216971513", "AffiliationID": "107392999", "AffiliationName": "Osong Research Institute, TaeWoong Medical Co., Ltd"}, "56538980400": {"Name": "Park J.T.", "AuthorID": "56538980400", "AffiliationID": "60170568", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oral Anatomy, College of Dentistry, Dankook University"}}}
