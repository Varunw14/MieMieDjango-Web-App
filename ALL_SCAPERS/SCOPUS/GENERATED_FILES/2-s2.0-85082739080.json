Applied Psychology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of International Association of Applied PsychologyPast turnover research has posited personality traits as important antecedents to quit intentions. Nevertheless, previous literature has not investigated the relationship between employees\u2019 entrepreneurial tendencies\u2014a constellation of domain specific traits\u2014and turnover. Drawing on dispositional trait theory and attraction-selection-attrition theory, we propose engagement and intentions to start a business as mediators of the relationship between entrepreneurial tendencies and quit intentions. We test our predictions in a sample of full-time employees from the United Kingdom (N = 224). In line with our hypotheses, an inconsistent mediation is found, where both positive and negative links between entrepreneurial tendencies and turnover intentions were mediated by engagement and intentions to start a business respectively. Thus, entrepreneurial employees were more likely to be engaged, but at the same time also more likely to be considering starting their own business, leading to a conflicting relationship to turnover intentions. The current study informs the human resource management literature concerning the motivational mechanisms explaining turnover intentions among entrepreneurial employees. It also provides practical insights with regards to the effective management of this workforce.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082739080", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"]], "AuthorData": {"24072779200": {"Name": "Ahmetoglu G.", "AuthorID": "24072779200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57216177980": {"Name": "Nefyodova V.", "AuthorID": "57216177980", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "8244744300": {"Name": "Chamorro-Premuzic T.", "AuthorID": "8244744300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57189710405": {"Name": "Codreanu S.C.", "AuthorID": "57189710405", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
