Here, we report an acoustic phonon recycling process in graphene-WS2 heterostructures, which couples the heat generated in graphene back into the carrier distribution in WS2. This recycling process is experimentally recorded by spectrally resolved transient absorption microscopy under a wide range of pumping energies from 1.77 to 0.48 eV and is also theoretically described using an interfacial thermal transport model. The acoustic phonon recycling process has a relatively slow characteristic time (>100 ps), which is beneficial for carrier extraction and distinct from the commonly found ultrafast hot carrier transfer (~1 ps) in graphene-WS2 heterostructures. The combination of phonon recycling and carrier transfer makes graphene-based heterostructures highly attractive for broadband high-efficiency electronic and optoelectronic applications.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088875741", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57190745721": {"Name": "Wei K.", "AuthorID": "57190745721", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57200244837": {"Name": "Sui Y.", "AuthorID": "57200244837", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "55598164400": {"Name": "Xu Z.", "AuthorID": "55598164400", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57218343280": {"Name": "Kang Y.", "AuthorID": "57218343280", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57203747260": {"Name": "Tang Y.", "AuthorID": "57203747260", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57193228861": {"Name": "Li H.", "AuthorID": "57193228861", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57212483886": {"Name": "Ma Y.", "AuthorID": "57212483886", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57210739043": {"Name": "Ouyang H.", "AuthorID": "57210739043", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "7401753972": {"Name": "Cheng X.", "AuthorID": "7401753972", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "35590198700": {"Name": "Jiang T.", "AuthorID": "35590198700", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "55792104600": {"Name": "You J.", "AuthorID": "55792104600", "AffiliationID": "60069719", "AffiliationName": "National Innovation Institute of Defense Technology, Academy of Military Sciences PLA China"}, "36571054700": {"Name": "Zheng X.", "AuthorID": "36571054700", "AffiliationID": "60069719", "AffiliationName": "National Innovation Institute of Defense Technology, Academy of Military Sciences PLA China"}}}
