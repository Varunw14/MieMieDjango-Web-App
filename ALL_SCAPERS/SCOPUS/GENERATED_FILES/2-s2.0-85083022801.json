Vaccines against EBV are in development. In this study we present the first systematic review of the literature on risk factors for EBV infection, and discuss how they differ between settings, in order to improve our understanding of EBV epidemiology and aid the design of effective vaccination strategies. Methods MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science were searched on 6th March 2017 for observational studies of risk factors for EBV infection. Studies were excluded if they were published before 2008 to ensure relevance to the modern day, given the importance of influencing future vaccination policies. There were no language restrictions. After title, abstract and full text screening, followed by checking the reference lists of included studies to identify further studies, data were extracted into standardised spreadsheets and quality assessed. A narrative synthesis was undertaken. Results Seventy-seven papers met our inclusion criteria, including data from 31 countries. There was consistent evidence that EBV seroprevalence was associated with age, increasing throughout childhood and adolescence and remaining constant thereafter. EBV was generally acquired at younger ages in Asia than Europe/North America. There was also compelling evidence for an association between cytomegalovirus infection and EBV. Additional factors associated with EBV seroprevalence, albeit with less consistent evidence, included ethnicity, socioeconomic status, other chronic viral infections, and genetic variants of HLA and immune response genes. Conclusions Our study is the first systematic review to draw together the global literature on the risk factors for EBV infection and includes an evaluation of the quality of the published evidence. Across the literature, the factors examined are diverse. In Asia, early vaccination of infants would be required to prevent EBV infection. In contrast, in Western countries a vaccine could be deployed later, particularly if it has only a short duration of protection and the intention was to protect against infectious mononucleosis. There is a lack of high-quality data on the prevalence and age of EBV infection outside of Europe, North America and South-East Asia, which are essential for informing effective vaccination policies in these settings.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Epstein-Barr Virus Infections", "Herpesvirus 4, Human", "Herpesvirus Vaccines", "Humans", "Infectious Mononucleosis", "Policy", "Risk Factors", "Vaccines"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083022801", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"56937761900": {"Name": "Winter J.R.", "AuthorID": "56937761900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Epidemiology and Translational Research, Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "55057756400": {"Name": "Jackson C.", "AuthorID": "55057756400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "55201612700": {"Name": "Stagg H.R.", "AuthorID": "55201612700", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"}, "57209531750": {"Name": "Lewis J.E.A.", "AuthorID": "57209531750", "AffiliationID": "60172638, 60015879, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Protection Research Unit in Modelling Methodology and Medical Research Council Centre for Outbreak Analysis and Public Health, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London"}, "57209074071": {"Name": "Taylor G.S.", "AuthorID": "57209074071", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "57212033542": {"Name": "Thomas O.G.", "AuthorID": "57212033542", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}}}
