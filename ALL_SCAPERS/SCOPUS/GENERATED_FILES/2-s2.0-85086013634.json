Recently, biallelic pathogenic variants in PDXK were shown to cause axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease with optic atrophy that responds to PLP supplementation. We present two affected siblings carrying a novel biallelic missense PDXK variant with a similar phenotype with earlier onset. After detection of a novel PDXK variant using Whole Exome Sequencing, we confirmed pathogenicity through in silico protein structure analysis, determination of pyridoxal kinase activity using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and measurement of plasma PLP concentrations using high performance liquid chromatography. Our in silico analysis shows a potential effect on PDXK dimer stability, as well as a putative effect on posttranslational ubiquitination that is predicted to lead to increased protein degradation. We demonstrate that the variant leads to almost complete loss of PDXK enzymatic activity and low PLP levels. Our patients\u2019 early diagnosis and prompt PLP replacement restored the PLP plasma levels, enabling long-term monitoring of clinical outcomes. We recommend that patients presenting with similar phenotype should be screened for PDXK mutations, as this is a rare opportunity for treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["hereditary neuropathy", "optic atrophy", "PDXK", "pyridoxal kinase", "pyridoxal phosphate", "vitamin B6"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086013634", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"16689285500": {"Name": "Keller N.", "AuthorID": "16689285500", "AffiliationID": "60024025", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Human Genetics, Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), Institute of Genetics, and Center for Rare Diseases Cologne, University of Cologne"}, "57192179391": {"Name": "Mendoza-Ferreira N.", "AuthorID": "57192179391", "AffiliationID": "60024025", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Human Genetics, Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), Institute of Genetics, and Center for Rare Diseases Cologne, University of Cologne"}, "7006861761": {"Name": "Wirth B.", "AuthorID": "7006861761", "AffiliationID": "60024025", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Human Genetics, Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), Institute of Genetics, and Center for Rare Diseases Cologne, University of Cologne"}, "57189390975": {"Name": "Karakaya M.", "AuthorID": "57189390975", "AffiliationID": "60024025", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Human Genetics, Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), Institute of Genetics, and Center for Rare Diseases Cologne, University of Cologne"}, "55921330400": {"Name": "Maroofian R.", "AuthorID": "55921330400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "18233632200": {"Name": "Karimiani E.G.", "AuthorID": "18233632200", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Genetics, Next Generation Genetic Polyclinic"}, "7003363686": {"Name": "Houlden H.", "AuthorID": "7003363686", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57188682705": {"Name": "Chelban V.", "AuthorID": "57188682705", "AffiliationID": "115115600", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Institute of Emergency Medicine"}, "57211660266": {"Name": "Khalil Y.", "AuthorID": "57211660266", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57202556029": {"Name": "Mills P.B.", "AuthorID": "57202556029", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57192174369": {"Name": "Boostani R.", "AuthorID": "57192174369", "AffiliationID": "60001853, 60001500", "AffiliationName": "Neurology Dept., Ghaem Hospital, Medical School, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences"}, "57210647464": {"Name": "Torbati P.N.", "AuthorID": "57210647464", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Genetics, Next Generation Genetic Polyclinic"}, "57202559332": {"Name": "Thiele H.", "AuthorID": "57202559332", "AffiliationID": "60024025", "AffiliationName": "Cologne Center for Genomics (CCG), University of Cologne"}}}
