All rights reserved.Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disorder characterised by non-caseating granulomas that typically affect the lungs, skin and lymph nodes. Sarcoidosis has been associated with various cancers, and we describe the case of a patient with systemic sarcoidosis associated with testicular seminoma. This was originally diagnosed as stable sarcoid-like reaction. He subsequently presented with ventricular tachycardia. Cardiovascular MRI suggested cardiac sarcoidosis, which was confirmed by myocardial biopsy. This case highlights the association between some types of cancer and sarcoidosis. In addition, it highlights the importance of close follow-up for patients with a history of malignancy to monitor for sarcoid-like reactions and sarcoidosis, which are often difficult to differentiate clinically.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Defibrillators, Implantable", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Heart Diseases", "Humans", "Lethargy", "Male", "Sarcoidosis", "Seminoma", "Testicular Neoplasms", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Vomiting"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072285536", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"56702432400": {"Name": "Bhatti P.", "AuthorID": "56702432400", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, King\u2019s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "37666222000": {"Name": "Waight M.", "AuthorID": "37666222000", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, King\u2019s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "26641821000": {"Name": "Bromage D.", "AuthorID": "26641821000", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, King\u2019s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57203175810": {"Name": "Sado D.", "AuthorID": "57203175810", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, King\u2019s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
