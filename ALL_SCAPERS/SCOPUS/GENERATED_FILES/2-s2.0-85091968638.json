In the more than 25 years since the first reports, the utility of native MS has become well established in the structural biology community. The experimental and technological advances during this time have been rapid, resulting in dramatic increases in sensitivity, mass range, resolution, and complexity of possible experiments. As experimental methods have improved, there have been accompanying developments in computational approaches for analyzing and exploiting the profusion of MS data in a structural and biophysical context. In this perspective, we consider the computational strategies currently being employed by the community, aspects of best practice, and the challenges that remain to be addressed. Our perspective is based on discussions within the European Cooperation in Science and Technology Action on Native Mass Spectrometry and Related Methods for Structural Biology (EU COST Action BM1403), which involved participants from across Europe and North America. It is intended not as an in-depth review but instead to provide an accessible introduction to and overview of the topic - to inform newcomers to the field and stimulate discussions in the community about addressing existing challenges. Our complementary perspective (http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b05792) focuses on software tools available to help researchers tackle some of the challenges enumerated here.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Computational approach", "Computational strategy", "Experimental methods", "Ion mobility-mass spectrometry", "Native mass spectrometries", "Non-covalent interaction", "Science and Technology", "Technological advances"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091968638", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"]], "AuthorData": {"36672476700": {"Name": "Allison T.M.", "AuthorID": "36672476700", "AffiliationID": "60020585", "AffiliationName": "School of Physical and Chemical Sciences, Biomolecular Interaction Centre, University of Canterbury"}, "6603059440": {"Name": "Barran P.", "AuthorID": "6603059440", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Michael Barber Centre for Collaborative Mass Spectrometry, Manchester Institute of Biotechnology, School of Chemistry, University of Manchester"}, "56983040800": {"Name": "Migas L.G.", "AuthorID": "56983040800", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Michael Barber Centre for Collaborative Mass Spectrometry, Manchester Institute of Biotechnology, School of Chemistry, University of Manchester"}, "7801640947": {"Name": "Cianf\u00e9rani S.", "AuthorID": "7801640947", "AffiliationID": "60103368, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Spectrom\u00e9trie de Masse BioOrganique (LSMBO), Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg, CNRS, IPHC UMR 7178"}, "26021796200": {"Name": "Degiacomi M.T.", "AuthorID": "26021796200", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Durham University"}, "7004677546": {"Name": "Gabelica V.", "AuthorID": "7004677546", "AffiliationID": "60102125, 60106903, 60008134, 60000905, 60104776", "AffiliationName": "University of Bordeaux, INSERM, CNRS, ARNA Laboratory"}, "7004632353": {"Name": "Grandori R.", "AuthorID": "7004632353", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biotechnology and Biosciences, University of Milano-Bicocca"}, "55752698700": {"Name": "Marklund E.G.", "AuthorID": "55752698700", "AffiliationID": "60022068, 60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry - BMC, Uppsala University"}, "56366188100": {"Name": "Menneteau T.", "AuthorID": "56366188100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biosciences, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College of London"}, "35097785800": {"Name": "Politis A.", "AuthorID": "35097785800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, King's College London"}, "15840628700": {"Name": "Thalassinos K.", "AuthorID": "15840628700", "AffiliationID": "100810810", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology"}, "57189466105": {"Name": "Sharon M.", "AuthorID": "57189466105", "AffiliationID": "60017563", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomolecular Sciences, Weizmann Institute of Science"}, "6602172684": {"Name": "Sobott F.", "AuthorID": "6602172684", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology, University of Leeds"}, "7003428980": {"Name": "Benesch J.L.P.", "AuthorID": "7003428980", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Chemistry Research Laboratory, University of Oxford"}}}
