The seed-mediated approach is one of the most promising and versatile routes to produce plasmonic heteromers. Selective growth of one or multiple domains on desired sites of noble metal, semiconductor, or magnetic seeds would form desired heteromeric nanostructures with multiple functionalities and synergistic effects. In this work, the challenges for the synthetic approaches are discussed with respect to tuning the thermodynamics, as well as the kinetic properties (e.g., pH, temperature, injection rate, among others). Then, plasmonic heteromers with their structure advantages displaying unique activities compared to other hybrid nanostructures (e.g., core\u2013shell, alloy) are highlighted. Some of the main most recent applications of plasmonic heteromers are also presented. Finally, perspectives for further exploitation of plasmonic heteromers are demonstrated. The goal of this work is to provide the current know-how on the synthesis routes of plasmonic heteromers in a summarized manner, so as to achieve a better understanding of the resulting properties and to gain an improved control of their performances and extend their breadth of applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["heterostructures", "interfaces", "plasmonic heteromers", "seed-mediated growth", "site-selective growth"], "IndexKeywords": ["Hybrid nanostructures", "Improved controls", "Kinetic properties", "Multiple domains", "Physical and chemical properties", "Selective growth", "Synergistic effect", "Synthetic approach"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089018654", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"56591264700": {"Name": "Zheng G.", "AuthorID": "56591264700", "AffiliationID": "60018554", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Microelectronics, Zhengzhou University"}, "16507083500": {"Name": "Mourdikoudis S.", "AuthorID": "16507083500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Healthcare Biomagnetic and Nanomaterials Laboratories"}, "56174456600": {"Name": "Zhang Z.", "AuthorID": "56174456600", "AffiliationID": "60019533", "AffiliationName": "Tianjin Key Laboratory of Molecular Optoelectronic Sciences, Department of Chemistry, School of Science, Tianjin University and Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemical Science and Engineering"}}}
