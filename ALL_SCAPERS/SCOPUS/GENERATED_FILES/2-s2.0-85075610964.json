As a novelty, this paper aims to quantify the influence of street aspect ratios (building height/street width, H/W = 0.5\u20135) and window sizes (1 m \u00d7 1 m, 1.5 m \u00d7 1.5 m) on indoor-outdoor ventilation in two-dimensional streets with single-sided naturally-ventilated buildings. Numerical simulations with RNG k-\u03b5 model are validated against experimental data and the grid independence are tested as well. Air change rates per hour (ACH, h\u22121) are adopted for assessing indoor-outdoor ventilation by mean flows (ACHmean) and turbulent fluctuations (ACHturb) respectively. Age of air(\u03c4), purging flow rate (PFR) and its corresponding ACHPFR are used to evaluate overall ventilation capacities. Shallower streets experience better indoor-outdoor ventilation. Outdoor ACHPFR drop from 14.69 to 17.55 h\u22121 to 3.96\u20133.97 h\u22121 as H/W rises from 0.5 to 3. In extremely deep canyon (H/W = 5), two-counter-rotating vortices produce much smaller velocity at low-level regions (U/Uref~10\u22123-10\u22125), resulting in small ACHPFR for outdoor (~0.76\u20130.91 h\u22121) and indoor in 1\u201313th floors (~0.03\u20130.61 h\u22121). When H/W = 0.5\u20131, leeward 5\u20136th floors experience smaller ACHPFR(e.g.~1.13\u20131.40 h\u22121 as H/W = 1) than the other floors (e.g. ~1.54\u20139.52 h\u22121 as H/W = 1). Particularly, as H/W = 2\u20133, leeward-side indoor ACHPFR in the middle floors (except the first and top two floors) are nearly constants (~1.02\u20131.69 h\u22121) and much smaller than windward-side ACHPFR(~1.41\u20134.35 h\u22121) which increase toward upper floors. Besides, the smaller window size reduces indoor ACHPFR by 19.38%~88.28%, but hardly influences outdoor ventilation. Moreover, both outdoor and indoor ACHPFR are greater than ACHmean but smaller than ACHmean + ACHturb. Although further investigations are still required, this paper provides an insight and scientific foundation on integrated indoor-outdoor ventilation evaluation with various effective ventilation indexes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Age of air", "Air change rate per hour (ACH)", "Building natural ventilation", "Computational fluid dynamics (CFD)", "Purging flow rate (PFR)", "Urban ventilation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age of air", "Air change rates", "Counter-rotating vortices", "Integrated assessment", "Natural ventilation", "Naturally ventilated buildings", "Scientific foundations", "Urban ventilation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075610964", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"]], "AuthorData": {"57207696586": {"Name": "Yang X.", "AuthorID": "57207696586", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "School of Atmospheric Sciences, Guangdong Province Key Laboratory for Climate Change and Natural Disaster Studies, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "57211989438": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "57211989438", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "School of Atmospheric Sciences, Guangdong Province Key Laboratory for Climate Change and Natural Disaster Studies, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "35240092500": {"Name": "Hang J.", "AuthorID": "35240092500", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "School of Atmospheric Sciences, Guangdong Province Key Laboratory for Climate Change and Natural Disaster Studies, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "57199188464": {"Name": "Lin Y.", "AuthorID": "57199188464", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "School of Atmospheric Sciences, Guangdong Province Key Laboratory for Climate Change and Natural Disaster Studies, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "41661913100": {"Name": "Mattsson M.", "AuthorID": "41661913100", "AffiliationID": "60031052", "AffiliationName": "Department of Building, Energy and Environmental Engineering, University of G\u00e4vle"}, "35585315900": {"Name": "Sandberg M.", "AuthorID": "35585315900", "AffiliationID": "60031052", "AffiliationName": "Department of Building, Energy and Environmental Engineering, University of G\u00e4vle"}, "57212870820": {"Name": "Zhang M.", "AuthorID": "57212870820", "AffiliationID": "60064143", "AffiliationName": "State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Physical Modeling and Pollution Control, State Power Environmental Protection Research Institute"}, "55547129784": {"Name": "Wang K.", "AuthorID": "55547129784", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College"}}}
