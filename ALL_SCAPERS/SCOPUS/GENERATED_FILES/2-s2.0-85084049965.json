Exploring the opportunities for energy savings and GHG emissions reductions requires understanding transportation energy or GHG intensity, which is defined as energy use or GHG emissions per unit activity, here passenger-kilometres travelled. This aggregate indicator quantifies the amount of energy required or GHGs emitted to provide a generic transportation service. We show that the range of observed energy and GHG intensities of major transportation modes is remarkably similar and that occupancy explains about 70\u201390% of the variation around the mean; only the remaining 10\u201330% is explained by differences in trip distances and other factors such as technology and operating conditions. Whereas average occupancy levels differ vastly, they translate into roughly similar levels of energy and GHG intensity for nearly all major transportation modes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Energy consumer", "Holistic analysis", "Occupancy levels", "Operating condition", "Passenger travels", "Transportation mode", "Transportation services", "Trip distances"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084049965", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Food Science", "AGRI", "1106"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"], ["Nature and Landscape Conservation", "ENVI", "2309"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"57209993091": {"Name": "Sch\u00e4fer A.W.", "AuthorID": "57209993091", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute, University College London"}, "57216615313": {"Name": "Yeh S.", "AuthorID": "57216615313", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Department of Space, Earth and Environment, Chalmers University of Technology"}}}
