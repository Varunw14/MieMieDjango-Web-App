Ukraine is a unique case due to the country\u2019s location in Eastern Europe, the sector\u2019s explosive growth within an otherwise stagnant economy, and related disconnectedness to other economic sectors. This study finds that the confluence of several windows of opportunity spurred an entrepreneurial response among hundreds of firms. However, most of these firms focus on low value-added segments of the ICT global value chain and lack the managerial and technical capabilities to compete globally, much less develop new products and services. As the global ICT services sector evolves, multi-level interventions are required to maintain the sector\u2019s growth trajectory and realize the economic and social benefits normally associated the development of a domestically inter-connected ICT sector. In order for Ukraine to secure its digital future, it must seize windows of opportunity in the global and European data economy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Organizational capabilities", "Outsourcing", "Software services", "Technology upgrading"], "IndexKeywords": ["Conceptual frameworks", "Developed economies", "Economic and social benefits", "Global value chain", "Growth trajectories", "Information and Communication Technology sectors", "Products and services", "Technical capabilities"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085132605", "SubjectAreas": [["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Accounting", "BUSI", "1402"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"57216878673": {"Name": "Aridi A.", "AuthorID": "57216878673", "AffiliationID": "60016293", "AffiliationName": "World Bank Group"}, "36491314800": {"Name": "Hayter C.S.", "AuthorID": "36491314800", "AffiliationID": "60015864", "AffiliationName": "Center for Organization Research and Design, School of Public Affairs, Arizona State University"}, "6701338037": {"Name": "Radosevic S.", "AuthorID": "6701338037", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Slavonic and East European Studies, University College London"}}}
