Prior to this, memory manipulation during sleep was at most a plot device in science fiction movies, but a large corpus of studies now demonstrates that TMR is both reliable and effective. TMR studies hypothesize that this method taps into normal consolidation mechanisms that require the repeated replay of memories during sleep. This idea has recently been supported by several new studies demonstrating that TMR upregulates the reactivation of cued memories, and that such upregulation predicts subsequent memory performance. This new body of work provides a unique window onto many properties of memory reactivation and helps to close the gap between our understanding of replay in rodents, where it has been visualised at the neural level for many years, and humans, where such studies are only just starting to become possible. We will discuss this new literature and highlight the vast potential of these new methods for future research. Lewis and Bendor review describe recent work using targeted memory reactivation during sleep in rodents and humans, which has allowed new insight into the neural mechanisms responsible for memory reconsolidation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Animals", "Cues", "Electroencephalography", "Humans", "Learning", "Memory", "Memory Consolidation", "Mental Recall", "Reaction Time", "Sleep"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072301113", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"55415067800": {"Name": "Lewis P.A.", "AuthorID": "55415067800", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Psychology Department, Cardiff University"}, "8533186700": {"Name": "Bendor D.", "AuthorID": "8533186700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}}}
