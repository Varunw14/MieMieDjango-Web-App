All rights reserved.Lake Baikal, lying in a rift zone in southeastern Siberia, is the world\u2019s oldest, deepest, and most voluminous lake that began to form over 30 million years ago. Cited as the \u201cmost outstanding example of a freshwater ecosystem\u201d and designated a World Heritage Site in 1996 due to its high level of endemicity, the lake and its ecosystem have become increasingly threatened by both climate change and anthropogenic disturbance. Here, we present a record of nutrient cycling in the lake, derived from the silicon isotope composition of diatoms, which dominate aquatic primary productivity. Using historical records from the region, we assess the extent to which natural and anthropogenic factors have altered biogeochemical cycling in the lake over the last 2,000 y. We show that rates of nutrient supply from deep waters to the photic zone have dramatically increased since the mid-19th century in response to changing wind dynamics, reduced ice cover, and their associated impact on limnological processes in the lake. With stressors linked to untreated sewage and catchment development also now impacting the near-shore region of Lake Baikal, the resilience of the lake\u2019s highly endemic ecosystem to ongoing and future disturbance is increasingly uncertain.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Climate", "Ecosystem", "Endemic", "Limnology", "Siberia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Climate Change", "Diatoms", "Ecosystem", "Environmental Science", "Fresh Water", "Geologic Sediments", "Ice Cover", "Lakes", "Nutrients", "Russia", "Siberia"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095665878", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"8577618200": {"Name": "Swann G.E.A.", "AuthorID": "8577618200", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, University of Nottingham"}, "22986519600": {"Name": "Panizzo V.N.", "AuthorID": "22986519600", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, University of Nottingham"}, "57219834552": {"Name": "Norman C.", "AuthorID": "57219834552", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, University of Nottingham"}, "7006808537": {"Name": "McGowan S.", "AuthorID": "7006808537", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, University of Nottingham"}, "55846056300": {"Name": "Piccolroaz S.", "AuthorID": "55846056300", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Physics of Aquatic Systems Laboratory, School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"}, "6505858739": {"Name": "Pashley V.", "AuthorID": "6505858739", "AffiliationID": "60022706", "AffiliationName": "Geochronology and Tracers Facility, British Geological Survey"}, "35801083300": {"Name": "Horstwood M.S.A.", "AuthorID": "35801083300", "AffiliationID": "60022706", "AffiliationName": "Geochronology and Tracers Facility, British Geological Survey"}, "56670690600": {"Name": "Roberts S.", "AuthorID": "56670690600", "AffiliationID": "60000673", "AffiliationName": "Canada Centre for Inland Waters, Environment and Climate Change Canada"}, "6506187811": {"Name": "Vologina E.", "AuthorID": "6506187811", "AffiliationID": "60103875, 60017604", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Earth\u2019s Crust, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "6506967071": {"Name": "Piotrowska N.", "AuthorID": "6506967071", "AffiliationID": "60009081", "AffiliationName": "Division of Geochronology and Environmental Isotopes, Institute of Physics\u2013Centre for Science and Education, Silesian University of Technology"}, "57203044843": {"Name": "Sturm M.", "AuthorID": "57203044843", "AffiliationID": "60002612, 60025858", "AffiliationName": "Eidgen\u00f6ssische Anstalt f\u00fcr Wasserversorgung, Abwasserreinigung und Gew\u00e4sserschutz, Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule, Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology"}, "7102748307": {"Name": "Zhdanov A.", "AuthorID": "7102748307", "AffiliationID": "60017604", "AffiliationName": "Limnology Institute, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "55382936000": {"Name": "Granin N.", "AuthorID": "55382936000", "AffiliationID": "60017604", "AffiliationName": "Limnology Institute, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "7202401987": {"Name": "Mackay A.W.", "AuthorID": "7202401987", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Research Centre, Department of Geography, University College London"}}}
