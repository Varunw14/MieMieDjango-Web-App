Historically, no such material exists, and materials engineers have had to sacrifice a desired property during materials selection, with metals (high density), fiber composites (brittle failure), and polymers (low stiffness) having fundamental limitations on at least one front. The ongoing revolution of nanomaterials provides a potential route to build on the potential of fiber-reinforced composites, matching their strength while integrating toughening behaviors akin to metal deformations, all while using low-weight constituents. Here, the challenges, approaches, and recent developments of nanomaterials for structural applications are discussed, with an emphasis on improving toughening mechanisms, which is often the neglected factor in a field that chases strength and stiffness.", "AuthorKeywords": ["carbon fiber", "carbon nanotube", "composite", "graphene", "nacre", "nanomaterials", "nanotechnology", "nanotube yarn", "supracrystal", "toughness"], "IndexKeywords": ["Fiber reinforced composites", "Fundamental limitations", "Materials selection", "Metal deformation", "Nanomaterial assemblies", "Strength and stiffness", "Structural applications", "Toughening mechanisms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083084966", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"56330351900": {"Name": "Clancy A.J.", "AuthorID": "56330351900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56379720700": {"Name": "Anthony D.B.", "AuthorID": "56379720700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "56999951000": {"Name": "De Luca F.", "AuthorID": "56999951000", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Materials Characterisation group, National Physical Laboratory"}}}
