There is moderate quality evidence that prenatal diagnosis of these conditions improves perinatal outcomes and the performance of ultrasound imaging in diagnosing them is considered excellent. The epidemiology of placenta previa is well known, and it is standard clinical practice to assess placental location at the routine screening second-trimester detailed fetal anatomy ultrasound examination. In contrast, the prevalence of placenta accreta spectrum and vasa previa in the general population is more difficult to evaluate because detailed confirmatory histopathologic data are not available in most studies. The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonography for the diagnosis of these anomalies is also difficult to assess. Recent epidemiologic studies show an increase in the incidence of placental and umbilical cord implantation anomalies, which may be the result of increased use of assisted reproductive technology and cesarean delivery. There is good evidence to support targeted standardized protocols for women at high risk and that screening and diagnosing placenta accreta spectrum and vasa previa should be integrated into obstetric ultrasound training programs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096508896", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"57203176734": {"Name": "Jauniaux E.", "AuthorID": "57203176734", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60019012", "AffiliationName": null}, "7201936904": {"Name": "Silver R.M.", "AuthorID": "7201936904", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
