When the lines utterly dominate their region of the spectrum, it becomes important to represent the profiles accurately over the whole range from the line centre to the far line wings. In this paper we examine the theories of spectral line shapes that have been used and carry out new calculations of the line shapes for the resonance lines of sodium and potassium broadened by helium.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alkali resonance doublets", "Cool stars: synthetic spectra", "Spectral line broadening calculations"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079281411", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"]], "AuthorData": {"6602083529": {"Name": "Peach G.", "AuthorID": "6602083529", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College"}, "35605893200": {"Name": "Yurchenko S.", "AuthorID": "35605893200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College"}, "57190285025": {"Name": "Chubb K.", "AuthorID": "57190285025", "AffiliationID": "60001512", "AffiliationName": "SRON, Netherlands Institute for Space Research"}, "55967916100": {"Name": "Baraffe I.", "AuthorID": "55967916100", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Exeter"}, "57209312587": {"Name": "Phillips M.", "AuthorID": "57209312587", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Exeter"}, "35321650700": {"Name": "Tremblin P.", "AuthorID": "35321650700", "AffiliationID": "60106225, 60019615", "AffiliationName": "Maison de la Simulation CEA Saclay"}}}
