Adaptation of research protocols using reagents designated as research-only to those which are suitable for clinical use, often referred to as good manufacturing practice (GMP) reagents, is a crucial and laborious step in the translational pipeline. However, published protocols to assist this process remain very limited. Methods: We adapted research-grade protocols for the derivation and differentiation of long-term neuroepithelial stem cell progenitors (lt-NES) to GMP-grade reagents and factors suitable for clinical applications. We screened the robustness of the protocol with six clinical-grade hESC lines deposited in the UK Stem Cell Bank. Results: Here, we present a new GMP-compliant protocol to derive lt-NES, which are multipotent, bankable and karyotypically stable. This protocol resulted in robust and reproducible differentiation of several clinical-grade embryonic stem cells from which we derived lt-NES. Furthermore, GMP-derived lt-NES demonstrated a high neurogenic potential while retaining the ability to be redirected to several neuronal sub-types. Conclusions: Overall, we report the feasibility of derivation and differentiation of clinical-grade embryonic stem cell lines into lt-NES under GMP-compliant conditions. Our protocols could be used as a flexible tool to speed up translation-to-clinic of pluripotent stem cells for a variety of neurological therapies or regenerative medicine studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cell therapy", "GMP", "hESCs", "Neural progenitors", "Pluripotent stem cells"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091266368", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)", "BIOC", "1301"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"44961659300": {"Name": "Vitillo L.", "AuthorID": "44961659300", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60105833", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Jeffrey Cheah Biomedical Centre, Department of Surgery, University of Cambridge"}, "57219107168": {"Name": "Durance C.", "AuthorID": "57219107168", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60105833", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Jeffrey Cheah Biomedical Centre, Department of Surgery, University of Cambridge"}, "8084280500": {"Name": "Smith A.", "AuthorID": "8084280500", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Living Systems Institute, University of Exeter"}, "22946015000": {"Name": "Vallier L.", "AuthorID": "22946015000", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60105833", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Jeffrey Cheah Biomedical Centre, Department of Surgery, University of Cambridge"}, "15056036500": {"Name": "Hewitt Z.", "AuthorID": "15056036500", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Stem Cell Biology, Department of Biomedical Science, University of Sheffield"}, "7202286939": {"Name": "Moore H.", "AuthorID": "7202286939", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Stem Cell Biology, Department of Biomedical Science, University of Sheffield"}}}
