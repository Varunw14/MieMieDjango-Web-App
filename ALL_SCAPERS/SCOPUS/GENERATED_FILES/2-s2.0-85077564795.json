Such models should be fast, as simple as possible, and user-friendly to be widely accepted by the ever-growing robotics research community. In this study, we introduce two new modeling methods for continuum manipulators: a general reduced-order model (ROM) and a discretized model with absolute states and Euler\u2013Bernoulli beam segments (EBA). In addition, a new formulation is presented for a recently introduced discretized model based on Euler\u2013Bernoulli beam segments and relative states (EBR). We implement these models in a Matlab software package, named TMTDyn, to develop a modeling tool for hybrid rigid\u2013continuum systems. The package features a new high-level language (HLL) text-based interface, a CAD-file import module, automatic formation of the system equation of motion (EOM) for different modeling and control tasks, implementing Matlab C-mex functionality for improved performance, and modules for static and linear modal analysis of a hybrid system. The underlying theory and software package are validated for modeling experimental results for (i) dynamics of a continuum appendage, and (ii) general deformation of a fabric sleeve worn by a rigid link pendulum. A comparison shows higher simulation accuracy (8\u201314% normalized error) and numerical robustness of the ROM model for a system with a small number of states, and computational efficiency of the EBA model with near real-time performances that makes it suitable for large systems. The challenges and necessary modules to further automate the design and analysis of hybrid systems with a large number of states are briefly discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["continuum robots", "Cosserat rod", "fabric", "high-level language", "hybrid mechanisms", "software", "tissue", "TMT Lagrange dynamics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Continuum robot", "Cosserat rod", "Hybrid mechanisms", "Lagrange dynamics", "MATLAB software package", "Modeling and control", "Numerical robustness", "Text-based interfaces"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077564795", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"57188663416": {"Name": "Sadati S.", "AuthorID": "57188663416", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Imaging and Biomedical Engineering, King\u2019s College London"}, "6602914628": {"Name": "Renson L.", "AuthorID": "6602914628", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Mathematics, University of Bristol"}, "35299439100": {"Name": "Hauser H.", "AuthorID": "35299439100", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Mathematics, University of Bristol"}, "26422797000": {"Name": "Bergeles C.", "AuthorID": "26422797000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Imaging and Biomedical Engineering, King\u2019s College London"}, "55386183900": {"Name": "Naghibi S.", "AuthorID": "55386183900", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "6701489118": {"Name": "Althoefer K.", "AuthorID": "6701489118", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57190121572": {"Name": "Shiva A.", "AuthorID": "57190121572", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Dyson School of Design Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "56921594000": {"Name": "Michael B.", "AuthorID": "56921594000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, King\u2019s College London"}, "7402455031": {"Name": "Howard M.", "AuthorID": "7402455031", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, King\u2019s College London"}, "6507021067": {"Name": "Zschaler S.", "AuthorID": "6507021067", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, King\u2019s College London"}, "6508336274": {"Name": "Nanayakkara T.", "AuthorID": "6508336274", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Dyson School of Design Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "57190497474": {"Name": "Rucker C.", "AuthorID": "57190497474", "AffiliationID": "60015574", "AffiliationName": "University of Tennessee"}, "35593049800": {"Name": "Walker I.", "AuthorID": "35593049800", "AffiliationID": "60026610", "AffiliationName": "Clemson University"}}}
