All rights reserved.Background Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a leading cause of morbidity and is associated with a 2 % - 17 % mortality rate in the UK and USA. Bleeding peptic ulcers account for 50 % of UGIB cases. Endoscopic intervention in a timely manner can improve outcomes. Hemostatic spray is an endoscopic hemostatic powder for GI bleeding. This multicenter registry was created to collect data prospectively on the immediate endoscopic hemostasis of GI bleeding in patients with peptic ulcer disease when hemostatic spray is applied as endoscopic monotherapy, dual therapy, or rescue therapy. Methods Data were collected prospectively (January 2016 - March 2019) from 14 centers in the UK, France, Germany, and the USA. The application of hemostatic spray was decided upon at the endoscopist's discretion. Results 202 patients with UGIB secondary to peptic ulcers were recruited. Immediate hemostasis was achieved in 178/202 patients (88 %), 26/154 (17 %) experienced rebleeding, 21/175 (12 %) died within 7 days, and 38/175 (22 %) died within 30 days (all-cause mortality). Combination therapy of hemostatic spray with other endoscopic modalities had an associated lower 30-day mortality (16 %, P < 0.05) compared with monotherapy or rescue therapy. There were high immediate hemostasis rates across all peptic ulcer disease Forrest classifications. Conclusions This is the largest case series of outcomes of peptic ulcer bleeding treated with hemostatic spray, with high immediate hemostasis rates for bleeding peptic ulcers.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85098194726", "SubjectAreas": [["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"57209028830": {"Name": "Hussein M.", "AuthorID": "57209028830", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London (UCL)"}, "35747755100": {"Name": "Alzoubaidi D.", "AuthorID": "35747755100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London (UCL)"}, "57203948405": {"Name": "Lovat L.B.", "AuthorID": "57203948405", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London (UCL)"}, "37120187600": {"Name": "Haidry R.", "AuthorID": "37120187600", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, University College London Hospital"}, "57221093015": {"Name": "Lopez M.F.", "AuthorID": "57221093015", "AffiliationID": "60025016", "AffiliationName": "Nottingham University Hospitals"}, "56076874600": {"Name": "Ortiz-Fernandez-Sordo J.", "AuthorID": "56076874600", "AffiliationID": "60025016", "AffiliationName": "Nottingham University Hospitals"}, "6603107719": {"Name": "Ragunath K.", "AuthorID": "6603107719", "AffiliationID": "60025016", "AffiliationName": "Nottingham University Hospitals"}, "57214761695": {"Name": "Weaver M.", "AuthorID": "57214761695", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis"}, "6506826031": {"Name": "Mullady D.K.", "AuthorID": "6506826031", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis"}, "57206683399": {"Name": "Early D.S.", "AuthorID": "57206683399", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis"}, "57217367086": {"Name": "Bassett P.", "AuthorID": "57217367086", "AffiliationID": "112710538", "AffiliationName": "Statsconsultancy Ltd."}, "35604357100": {"Name": "Rey J.W.", "AuthorID": "35604357100", "AffiliationID": "60022507", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Klinikum Osnabruck"}, "57221110544": {"Name": "Hayee B.H.", "AuthorID": "57221110544", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Kings College Hospital"}, "15759059900": {"Name": "Despott E.", "AuthorID": "15759059900", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, The Royal Free Hospital"}, "46861224500": {"Name": "Murino A.", "AuthorID": "46861224500", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, The Royal Free Hospital"}, "6507038947": {"Name": "Moreea S.", "AuthorID": "6507038947", "AffiliationID": "60016450", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Bradford Teaching Hospitals Foundation Trust"}, "36629935600": {"Name": "Boger P.", "AuthorID": "36629935600", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, University Hospital Southampton"}, "24066443800": {"Name": "Dunn J.", "AuthorID": "24066443800", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Guy's and St Thomas' Foundation Trust Hospitals"}, "8577263100": {"Name": "Mainie I.", "AuthorID": "8577263100", "AffiliationID": "60030456", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Belfast Health and Social Care Trust"}, "56358375900": {"Name": "Graham D.", "AuthorID": "56358375900", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, University College London Hospital"}, "56137363700": {"Name": "Anderson J.T.", "AuthorID": "56137363700", "AffiliationID": "60021179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8289974500": {"Name": "Bhandari P.", "AuthorID": "8289974500", "AffiliationID": "60030382", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "57221081335": {"Name": "Goetz M.", "AuthorID": "57221081335", "AffiliationID": "60022653", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, T\u00fcbingen University Hospital"}, "22234423500": {"Name": "Kiesslich R.", "AuthorID": "22234423500", "AffiliationID": "60073790", "AffiliationName": "Horst Schmidt Kliniken"}, "22134096900": {"Name": "Coron E.", "AuthorID": "22134096900", "AffiliationID": "60028048", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire"}}}
