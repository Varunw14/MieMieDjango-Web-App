However, there is a lack of efficient strategies and comprehensive approaches for managing assets and their associated data that can help to monitor, detect, record, and communicate operation and maintenance (O&M) issues. With the importance of Digital Twin (DT) concepts being proven in the architecture, engineering, construction and facility management (AEC/FM) sectors, a DT-enabled anomaly detection system for asset monitoring and its data integration method based on extended industry foundation classes (IFC) in daily O&M management are provided in this study. This paper presents a novel IFC-based data structure, using which a set of monitoring data that carries diagnostic information on the operational condition of assets is extracted from building DTs. Considering that assets run under changing loads determined by human demands, a Bayesian change point detection methodology that handles the contextual features of operational data is adopted to identify and filter contextual anomalies through cross-referencing with external operation information. Using the centrifugal pumps in the heating, ventilation and air-cooling (HVAC) system as a case study, the results indicate and prove that the novel DT-based anomaly detection process flow realizes a continuous anomaly detection of pumps, which contributes to efficient and automated asset monitoring in O&M.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anomaly detection", "Digital twin", "Industry Foundation Classes (IFC)", "Operation and Maintenance management"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anomaly detection systems", "Change point detection", "Efficient strategy", "Facility management", "Industry Foundation Classes - IFC", "Integration method", "Operation and maintenance", "Operational conditions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085247924", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"]], "AuthorData": {"56717065200": {"Name": "Lu Q.", "AuthorID": "56717065200", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London"}, "57210411313": {"Name": "Xie X.", "AuthorID": "57210411313", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Manufacturing, University of Cambridge"}, "9736080300": {"Name": "Parlikad A.K.", "AuthorID": "9736080300", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Manufacturing, University of Cambridge"}, "57189900369": {"Name": "Schooling J.M.", "AuthorID": "57189900369", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Smart Infrastructure and Construction, University of Cambridge"}}}
