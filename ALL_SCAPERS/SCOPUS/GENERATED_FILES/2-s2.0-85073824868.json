We often hold each other to account for the beliefs that we hold. We do this by criticising other believers as \u2018gullible\u2019 or \u2018biased\u2019, and by trying to persuade others to revise their beliefs. But responsibility for belief looks hard to understand because we seem to lack control over our beliefs. In this paper, I argue that we can make progress in our understanding of responsibility for belief by thinking about it in parallel with another kind of responsibility: legal responsibility for criminal negligence. Specifically, I argue that that a popular account of responsibility for belief, which grounds it in belief\u2019s reasons-responsiveness, faces a problem analogous to one faced by H.L.A. Hart\u2019s influential capacity-based account of culpability. This points towards a more promising account of responsibility of belief, though, if we draw on accounts of negligence that improve on Hart\u2019s. Broadly speaking, the account of negligence that improves on Hart\u2019s account grounds culpability in a (lack of) concern for others\u2019 interests, whereas my account of epistemic responsibility grounds responsibility for belief in a (lack of) concern for the truth.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Belief", "Epistemology", "H.L.A.
