The technique models either the incident or reflected wave as the output of a finite impulse response (FIR) filter, and subsequently apply least-squares estimation (LSE) to estimate the reflection or transmission coefficients which minimize the error of said wave. When compared against the existing technique, the proposed technique offers precision improvement to the estimated reflection and transmission coefficients. Faster VNA measurements using up to 15-MHz intermediate frequency (IF) bandwidth are experimentally shown to be significantly improved to give good correspondence with slower measurements using 100-Hz IF bandwidth as reference. Error improvement across the measurement bandwidth of more than 17 dB is experimentally observed. Furthermore, the improvement is applicable to both the frequency regions with higher and lower signal to noise ratios of the reflected waves. On the other hand, applying the proposed technique in a wideband active load-pull system to estimate the load reflection coefficients, results in significant error improvement over the existing technique. The error improvement is also experimentally observed both in the in-band 3-dB bandwidth frequency region of the wideband modulated test signal and the out-of-band intermodulation frequency regions, where error improvement of 36 dB is observed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Active load-pull", "dynamic range", "estimation theory", "finite impulse response (FIR) filter", "identification theory", "least squares estimation (LSE)", "measurement technique", "microwave network analysis", "passive load-pull", "reflection coefficient", "scattering parameters (S-parameters)", "transmission coefficient", "vector network analyzer (VNA)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Active load", "Dynamic range", "Estimation theory", "Least-squares estimation", "Load pull", "Measurement techniques", "Microwave networks", "Transmission coefficients", "Vector network analyzers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078256457", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55773261300": {"Name": "Nopchinda D.", "AuthorID": "55773261300", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microtechnology and Nanoscience, Microwave Electronics Laboratory, Chalmers University of Technology"}, "57193219885": {"Name": "Zirath H.", "AuthorID": "57193219885", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microtechnology and Nanoscience, Microwave Electronics Laboratory, Chalmers University of Technology"}, "14821875800": {"Name": "Buisman K.", "AuthorID": "14821875800", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microtechnology and Nanoscience, Microwave Electronics Laboratory, Chalmers University of Technology"}, "35617103600": {"Name": "Eriksson T.", "AuthorID": "35617103600", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology"}}}
