We design and conduct a three-part study: (1) an analytic evaluation of the user interface of private mode in different browsers; (2) a qualitative user study to explore user mental models of private browsing; (3) a participatory design study to investigate why existing browser disclosures, the in-browser explanations of private mode, do not communicate the actual protection of private mode. We find the user interface of private mode in different browsers violated well-established design guidelines and heuristics. Further, most participants had incorrect mental models of private browsing, influencing their understanding and usage of private mode. We also find existing browser disclosures did not explain the primary security goal of private mode. Drawing from the results of our study, we extract a set of recommendations to improve the design of disclosures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["human-computer interaction", "usable security and privacy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Analytic evaluation", "End-user experience", "In browsers", "Mental model", "Participatory design", "Security goals", "User study"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091307270", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"56426418900": {"Name": "Abu-Salma R.", "AuthorID": "56426418900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL)"}, "12139816400": {"Name": "Livshits B.", "AuthorID": "12139816400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Brave Software and Imperial College London"}}}
