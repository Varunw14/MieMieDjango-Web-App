III-V semiconductors, which offer excellent optical emission properties have therefore been widely investigated to produce efficient emitters integrated on silicon substrates. The material dissimilarity between silicon and III-V materials poses a major challenge to monolithic integration. Recently, direct III-V/Si integration has received renewed interest, boosted by the recent demonstration of high performance III-V quantum dot lasers by direct epitaxial growth on Si. These quantum dot lasers, monolithically grown on Si substrates, provide an alternative to hybrid integration for integrating photonic circuitry on a Si platform.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Hybrid integration", "III-V/Si integrations", "Monolithic integration", "Optical emissions", "Photonic circuitry", "Si photonics", "Si substrates", "Silicon substrates"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088356649", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"7004751445": {"Name": "Seeds A.", "AuthorID": "7004751445", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "10141185300": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "10141185300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "54939079100": {"Name": "Chen S.", "AuthorID": "54939079100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55365959800": {"Name": "Tang M.", "AuthorID": "55365959800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "36573632900": {"Name": "Jiang Q.", "AuthorID": "36573632900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "15765485000": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "15765485000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
