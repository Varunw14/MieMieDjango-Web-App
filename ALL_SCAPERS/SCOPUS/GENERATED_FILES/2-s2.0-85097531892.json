However, one of the most critical issues for superhydrophobic surfaces is the durability or stability of the water-repellent property, since the micro- or nanoscale structures on superhydrophobic surfaces are fragile and can be easily destroyed. Once the superhydrophobicity is lost, the surface anti-adhesion and antibacterial properties will decline. In this work, we present a large-scale fabrication of free-standing silicone-based composite monoliths with strong robust superhydrophobic properties under abrasion, stretching, bending, twisting, knife-scratch, high external pressure and low temperature. The water-repellent property prevents bacteria adhesion, and the addition of antimicrobial particles will further kill any surface-attached bacteria. The general fabrication can be extended to other elastic silicone-based antibacterial materials on a large scale, which are potentially advantageous in practical applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["antibacterial adhesion", "flexible", "robust", "silicone rubber", "superhydrophobic"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85097531892", "SubjectAreas": [["Polymers and Plastics", "MATE", "2507"], ["Process Chemistry and Technology", "CENG", "1508"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"57208510476": {"Name": "Wang H.", "AuthorID": "57208510476", "AffiliationID": "60003146", "AffiliationName": "Engineering Research Center for Nanomaterials, Henan University"}, "57218552765": {"Name": "Wang K.", "AuthorID": "57218552765", "AffiliationID": "60011549, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Solid Lubrication, Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "57188633922": {"Name": "Lu H.", "AuthorID": "57188633922", "AffiliationID": "60003146", "AffiliationName": "Engineering Research Center for Nanomaterials, Henan University"}, "55152871600": {"Name": "Zhang X.", "AuthorID": "55152871600", "AffiliationID": "60011549, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Solid Lubrication, Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
