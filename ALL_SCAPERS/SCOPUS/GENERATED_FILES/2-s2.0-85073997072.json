By reviewing existing literature and drawing on a survey of practice around the democratic world, this article addresses this gap by making three contributions. First, it identifies four key dimensions to high-quality information: accuracy; balance; accessibility; and relevance. Second, it identifies four strategies through which information quality may be advanced: controlling campaign finance; confronting misinformation; creating and disseminating quality information; and promoting quality discussion. Third, it examines existing knowledge on the most promising of these strategies, offering preliminary conclusions and pointers for further research. The article suggests that the optimal strategy has not yet been found, and that further research could help to develop it.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deliberation", "democracy", "information", "referendum"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073997072", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"57201726743": {"Name": "Renwick A.", "AuthorID": "57201726743", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Constitution Unit, Department of Political Science, University College London"}, "57204364439": {"Name": "Palese M.", "AuthorID": "57204364439", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Constitution Unit, Department of Political Science, University College London"}, "57204364221": {"Name": "Sargeant J.", "AuthorID": "57204364221", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Constitution Unit, Department of Political Science, University College London"}}}
