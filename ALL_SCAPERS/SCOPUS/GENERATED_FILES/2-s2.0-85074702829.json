The disease is characterized by motor, behavioural and cognitive symptoms for which at present there are no disease altering treatments. It has been shown that manipulating the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway using rapamycin or its analogue CCI-779 can improve the cellular and behavioural phenotypes of HD models. Ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) is a major downstream signalling molecule of mTOR, and its activity is reduced by rapamycin suggesting that deregulation of S6K1 activity may be beneficial in HD. Furthermore, S6k1 knockout mice have increased lifespan and improvement in age-related phenotypes. To evalute the potential benefit of S6k1 loss on HD-related phenotypes, we crossed the R6/2 HD model with the long-lived S6k1 knockout mouse line. We found that S6k1 knockout does not ameliorate behavioural or physiological phenotypes in the R6/2 mouse model. Additionally, no improvements were seen in brain mass reduction or mutant huntingtin protein aggregate levels. Therefore, these results suggest that while a reduction in S6K1 signalling has beneficial effects on ageing it is unlikely to be a therapeutic strategy for HD patients.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Female", "Gene Deletion", "Humans", "Huntingtin Protein", "Huntington Disease", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Mice, Transgenic", "Phenotype", "Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 90-kDa"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074702829", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"7005163901": {"Name": "Irvine E.E.", "AuthorID": "7005163901", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "43161109200": {"Name": "Katsouri L.", "AuthorID": "43161109200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "8523286100": {"Name": "Al-Qassab H.", "AuthorID": "8523286100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "7005989616": {"Name": "Withers D.J.", "AuthorID": "7005989616", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "8855208200": {"Name": "Plattner F.", "AuthorID": "8855208200", "AffiliationID": "60026695", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center"}, "56114889200": {"Name": "Al-Nackkash R.", "AuthorID": "56114889200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, King\u2019s College London"}, "35380748900": {"Name": "Bates G.P.", "AuthorID": "35380748900", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Huntington\u2019s Disease Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease and UK Dementia Research Institute, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
