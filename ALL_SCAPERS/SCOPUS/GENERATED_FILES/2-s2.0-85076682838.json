Robotic THA improves precision and reduces outliers in restoring the planned centre of hip rotation compared to conventional manual THA. Improved accuracy in restoring hip biomechanics and acetabular cup positioning in robotic THA have not translated to any differences in early functional outcomes, correction of leg-length discrepancy, or postoperative complications compared to conventional manual THA. Limitations of robotic THA include substantive installation costs, additional radiation exposure, steep learning curves for gaining surgical proficiency, and compatibility of the robotic technology with a limited number of implant designs. Further higher quality studies are required to compare differences in conventional versus robotic THA in relation to long-term functional outcomes, implant survivorship, time to revision surgery, and cost-effectiveness.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Functional outcomes", "Hip biomechanics", "Implant positioning", "Robotics", "Total hip arthroplasty/replacement"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076682838", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"53979939900": {"Name": "Kayani B.", "AuthorID": "53979939900", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital"}, "24466324900": {"Name": "Konan S.", "AuthorID": "24466324900", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital"}, "57211990959": {"Name": "Ayuob A.", "AuthorID": "57211990959", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital"}, "57206656986": {"Name": "Ayyad S.", "AuthorID": "57206656986", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital"}, "7203033976": {"Name": "Haddad F.S.", "AuthorID": "7203033976", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital"}}}
