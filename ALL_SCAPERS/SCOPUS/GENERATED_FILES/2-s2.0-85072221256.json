As MRI lacks contrast for bony structures, computed tomography (CT) is preferred for clinical evaluation of bone tissue and orthopaedic surgical planning. Combining the complementary information of MRI and CT could improve current clinical practice for diagnosis, monitoring and treatment planning. In particular, the different contrast of these modalities could help better quantify the presence of fatty infiltration to characterise muscular condition and assess implant failure. In this work, we combine CT and MRI for joint bone and muscle segmentation and we propose a novel Intramuscular Fat Fraction estimation method for the quantification of muscle atrophy. Methods: Our multimodal framework is able to segment healthy and pathological musculoskeletal structures as well as implants, and develops into three steps. First, input images are pre-processed to improve the low quality of clinically acquired images and to reduce the noise associated with metal artefact. Subsequently, CT and MRI are non-linearly aligned using a novel approach which imposes rigidity constraints on bony structures to ensure realistic deformation. Finally, taking advantage of a multimodal atlas we created for this task, a multi-atlas based segmentation delineates pelvic bones, abductor muscles and implants on both modalities jointly. From the obtained segmentation, a multimodal estimation of the Intramuscular Fat Fraction can be automatically derived. Results: Evaluation of the segmentation in a leave-one-out cross-validation study on 22 hip sides resulted in an average Dice score of 0.90 for skeletal and 0.84 for muscular structures. Our multimodal Intramuscular Fat Fraction was benchmarked on 27 different cases against a standard radiological score, showing stronger association than a single modality approach in a one-way ANOVA F-test analysis. Conclusions: The proposed framework represents a promising tool to support image analysis in hip arthroplasty, being robust to the presence of implants and associated image artefacts. By allowing for the automated extraction of a muscle atrophy imaging biomarker, it could quantitatively inform the decision-making process about patient's management.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fat infiltration", "Hip arthroplasty", "Multimodal registration", "Multimodal segmentation", "Muscle atrophy", "Musculoskeletal imaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Decision making process", "Hip arthroplasties", "Leave-one-out cross validations", "Multi atlas-based segmentations", "Multi-modal segmentation", "Multimodal registration", "Muscle atrophy", "Musculo-skeletal structures", "Adipose Tissue", "Adult", "Aged", "Algorithms", "Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip", "Female", "Hip Joint", "Hip Prosthesis", "Humans", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multimodal Imaging", "Muscles", "Muscular Atrophy", "Pattern Recognition, Automated", "Reproducibility of Results", "Retrospective Studies", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072221256", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"57200575540": {"Name": "Ranzini M.B.M.", "AuthorID": "57200575540", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "57193152354": {"Name": "Ebner M.", "AuthorID": "57193152354", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "56089319500": {"Name": "Henckel J.", "AuthorID": "56089319500", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24597673100": {"Name": "Hart A.", "AuthorID": "24597673100", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57204636980": {"Name": "Cardoso M.J.", "AuthorID": "57204636980", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "57192649326": {"Name": "Isaac A.", "AuthorID": "57192649326", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Radiology Department, Guys & St Thomas Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "23010613000": {"Name": "Vercauteren T.", "AuthorID": "23010613000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "24376919100": {"Name": "Modat M.", "AuthorID": "24376919100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering Department, University College London"}}}
