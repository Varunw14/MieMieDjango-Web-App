The transcription factor c-MYB functions as one such mediator in a diverse range of leukemias. Here we show for the first time that transcriptional repression of myeloid differentiation associated c-MYB target genes in AML is enforced by the AAA+ ATPase RUVBL2. Silencing RUVBL2 expression resulted in increased binding of c-MYB to these loci and their transcriptional activation. RUVBL2 inhibition resulted in AML cell apoptosis and severely impaired disease progression of established AML in engrafted mice. In contrast, such inhibition had little impact on normal hematopoietic progenitor differentiation. These data demonstrate that RUVBL2 is essential for the oncogenic function of c-MYB in AML by governing inhibition of myeloid differentiation. They also indicate that targeting the control of c-MYB function by RUVBL2 is a promising approach to developing future anti-AML therapies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "ATPases Associated with Diverse Cellular Activities", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Transformation, Neoplastic", "Disease Models, Animal", "Disease Progression", "DNA Helicases", "Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic", "Gene Knockdown Techniques", "Hematopoiesis", "Humans", "Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute", "Mice", "Protein Binding", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb", "Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072796893", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"55200320600": {"Name": "Armenteros-Monterroso E.", "AuthorID": "55200320600", "AffiliationID": "118268667", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Section, Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme"}, "57211989592": {"Name": "Zhao L.", "AuthorID": "57211989592", "AffiliationID": "118268667", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Section, Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme"}, "55632515700": {"Name": "Gasparoli L.", "AuthorID": "55632515700", "AffiliationID": "118268667", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Section, Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme"}, "57220659499": {"Name": "de Boer J.", "AuthorID": "57220659499", "AffiliationID": "118268667", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Section, Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme"}, "8081160000": {"Name": "Williams O.", "AuthorID": "8081160000", "AffiliationID": "118268667", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Section, Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme"}, "55531982300": {"Name": "Brooks T.", "AuthorID": "55531982300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Genomics, UCL GOS Institute of Child Health"}, "24595835100": {"Name": "Pearce K.", "AuthorID": "24595835100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Genomics, UCL GOS Institute of Child Health"}, "16646833400": {"Name": "Mansour M.R.", "AuthorID": "16646833400", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, UCL Cancer Institute"}, "7201836987": {"Name": "Martens J.H.A.", "AuthorID": "7201836987", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Science, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University"}}}
