CMR-guided right heart catheterization (CMR-RHC) combines the benefits of CMR and invasive cardiac catheterization, but its feasibility in patients with acquired PAH has not been established. The aims of this study are to: (1) demonstrate the feasibility of CMR-RHC in patients being assessed for PAH in a conventional diagnostic CMR scanner room; (2) determine the predictors of (i) procedure duration, and (ii) procedural failure or technical difficulty as determined by the adjunctive need for a guidewire. Methods: Fifty patients investigated for suspected or known PH underwent CMR-RHC. Durations of separate procedural components were recorded, including time taken to pass the catheter from the femoral vein to a stable wedge position (procedure time) and total time the patient spent in the CMR department (department time). Associations between procedural failure/guidewire usage and hemodynamic/CMR measures were assessed using logistic regression. Relationships between procedure times and hemodynamic/CMR measures were evaluated using Spearman's correlation coefficient. Results: A full CMR-RHC study was successfully completed in 47 (94%) patients. CMR-conditional guidewires were used in 6 (12%) patients. Metrics associated with guidewire use/procedural failure were higher mean pulmonary artery (PA) pressures (mPAP: OR = 1.125, p = 0.018), right heart dilatation (right ventricular (RV) end-systolic volume (RVESV): OR = 1.028, p = 0.018), RV hypertrophy (OR = 1.050, p = 0.0067) and RV ejection fraction (EF) (OR = 0.914, p = 0.014). Median catheter and department times were 3.6 (2.0-7.7) minutes and 60.0 (54.0-68.5) minutes, respectively. All procedure times became significantly shorter with increasing procedural experience (p < 0.05). Catheterization time was also associated with PH severity (RV systolic pressure: rho = 0.46, p = 0.0013) and increasing RV end-systolic volume (RVESV: rho = 0.41, p = 0.0043), hypertrophy (rho = 0.43, p = 0.0025) and dysfunction (RVEF: rho = - 0.32, p = 0.031). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that CMR-RHC using standard technology can be incorporated into routine clinical practice for the investigation of PAH. Procedural failure was rare but more likely in patients with severe PAH. Procedure time is clinically acceptable and increases with worsening PAH severity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging", "Guidewire", "Interventional cardiovascular MR catheterization", "Pulmonary hypertension", "Right heart catheterization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Arterial Pressure", "Cardiac Catheterization", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Interventional", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prognosis", "Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension", "Pulmonary Artery", "Time Factors", "Workflow", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071896462", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"55589453200": {"Name": "Knight D.S.", "AuthorID": "55589453200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Cardiac MRI, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "57212760167": {"Name": "Brown J.T.", "AuthorID": "57212760167", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Cardiac MRI, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "35393553500": {"Name": "Coghlan J.G.", "AuthorID": "35393553500", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "38661453500": {"Name": "Kotecha T.", "AuthorID": "38661453500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Cardiac MRI, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "55343433500": {"Name": "Martinez-Naharro A.", "AuthorID": "55343433500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Cardiac MRI, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "48460979200": {"Name": "Bertelli M.", "AuthorID": "48460979200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Cardiac MRI, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "16306839900": {"Name": "Fontana M.", "AuthorID": "16306839900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Cardiac MRI, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "7801671480": {"Name": "Muthurangu V.", "AuthorID": "7801671480", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London and Great Ormond Street, Hospital for Children"}}}
