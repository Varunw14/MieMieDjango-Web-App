We used fMRI to examine neural representation of task identity, component items, and sequential position, focusing on two major cortical systems\u2014the multiple-demand (MD) and default mode networks (DMN). Human participants (20 males, 22 females) learned six tasks each consisting of four steps. Inside the scanner, participants were cued which task to perform and then sequentially identified the target item of each step in the correct order. Univariate time course analyses indicated that intra-episode progress was tracked by a tonically increasing global response, plus an increasing phasic step response specific to MD regions. Inter-episode boundaries evoked a widespread response at episode onset, plus a marked offset response specific to DMN regions. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) was used to examine representation of task identity and component steps. Both networks represented the content and position of individual steps, however the DMN preferentially represented task identity while the MD network preferentially represented step-level information. Thus, although both MD and DMN networks are sensitive to step-level and episode-level information in the context of hierarchical task performance, they exhibit dissociable profiles in terms of both temporal dynamics and representational content. The results suggest collaboration of multiple brain regions in control of multistep behavior, with MD regions particularly involved in processing the detail of individual steps, and DMN adding representation of broad task context.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Default mode network", "FMRI", "Hierarchy", "Multiple-demand network", "Representational similarity analysis", "Task episodes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Connectome", "Executive Function", "Female", "Frontal Lobe", "Goals", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Memory"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092681092", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"56440888500": {"Name": "Wen T.", "AuthorID": "56440888500", "AffiliationID": "60029069, 60015879, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, University of Cambridge"}, "57211727566": {"Name": "Duncan J.", "AuthorID": "57211727566", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford, Radcliffe Observatory"}, "55722202000": {"Name": "Mitchell D.J.", "AuthorID": "55722202000", "AffiliationID": "60029069, 60015879, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, University of Cambridge"}}}
