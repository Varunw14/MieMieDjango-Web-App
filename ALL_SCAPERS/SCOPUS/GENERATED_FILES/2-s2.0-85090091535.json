We describe the composition of the corpus and mention the technical challenges inherent in its creation, and then present the 500-email subset, in which all messages are categorized according to sender and recipient gender, position in the workplace hierarchy, and personal closeness to Clinton. The analysis looks at the most frequent bigrams in each of these subsets as a starting point for the identification of linguistic differences. We find that the main differences relate to the content and function of the messages rather than their tone. Individuals lower in the hierarchy but not in Clinton\u2019s inner circle are more often engaged in practical tasks, while members of the inner circle primarily discuss issues and use email to arrange in-person conversations. Clinton herself is generally found to engage neither in extensive politeness nor in overt displays of power. These findings present further evidence of how corpus linguistics can be used to advance our understanding of workplace pragmatics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Email", "Gender", "Hillary Clinton", "Politeness", "Workplace communication"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090091535", "SubjectAreas": [["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"52163504300": {"Name": "De Felice R.", "AuthorID": "52163504300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56479198300": {"Name": "Garretson G.", "AuthorID": "56479198300", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Uppsala University"}}}
