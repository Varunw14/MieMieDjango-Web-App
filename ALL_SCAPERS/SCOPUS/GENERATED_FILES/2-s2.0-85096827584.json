For this reason, such trials require large numbers of patients observed over long intervals and become more costly. We propose a probabilistic ensemble model and a cycle-consistent perceptual loss for improving the statistical power of trials utilizing TDOCT. TDOCT are converted to synthesized SDOCT and segmented via Bayesian fusion of an ensemble of GANs. The final retinal nerve fibre layer segmentation is obtained automatically on an averaged synthesized image using label fusion. We benchmark different networks using i) GAN, ii) Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) (iii) GAN + perceptual loss and iv) WGAN + perceptual loss. For training and validation, an independent dataset is used, while testing is performed on the UK Glaucoma Treatment Study (UKGTS), i.e. a TDOCT-based trial. We quantify the statistical power of the measurements obtained with our method, as compared with those derived from the original TDOCT. The results provide new insights into the UKGTS, showing a significantly better separation between treatment arms, while improving the statistical power of TDOCT on par with visual field measurements.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clinical trials", "Deep learning", "GAN", "Glaucoma", "Label fusion", "Optical coherence tomography", "Perceptual loss", "Statistical power"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adversarial networks", "Glaucoma management", "Layer segmentation", "Low signal-to-noise ratio", "Probabilistic ensemble", "Spectral domain OCT", "Statistical power", "Synthesized images"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096827584", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"57220383547": {"Name": "Lazaridis G.", "AuthorID": "57220383547", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and the Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "26654433200": {"Name": "Lorenzi M.", "AuthorID": "26654433200", "AffiliationID": "60110693, 60013373", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 C\u00f4te dAzur, Inria"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "7004460319": {"Name": "Garway-Heath D.", "AuthorID": "7004460319", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and the Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}}}
