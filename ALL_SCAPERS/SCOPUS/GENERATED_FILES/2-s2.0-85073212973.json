However, the onset of vortex-shedding and the mixing efficiency are highly sensitive to the confinement imposed by the microchannel walls. In this work, the time dependent flow past a cylindrical pin in microchannels with different levels of confinement was studied experimentally. The onset of vortex-shedding in such flows is associated with high, kilohertz range frequencies that are difficult to resolve using conventional laser-based microscale particle image velocimetry (\u03bcPIV) techniques. Hence, in this study, a high-speed \u03bcPIV technique was implemented in order to obtain time-resolved measurements of the velocity fields downstream of the micropin to estimate the corresponding vortex-shedding frequencies and quantify the mixing in the pin wake. The vertical confinement (pin length to diameter ratio) was found to delay the onset of vortex-shedding. When vortex-shedding was present, the shedding frequency and the corresponding Strouhal numbers were found to be greater in channels with higher lateral confinement for the same Reynolds number. Finite-time Lyapunov exponent analysis was performed on the acquired velocity fields to estimate the mixing performance. The results clearly illustrated the significant enhancement in both the mixing in the wake and the mass flux across the centerline of the wake induced by vortex-shedding.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Conventional lasers", "Finite-time Lyapunov exponent", "Lateral confinement", "Micro-scale particles", "Shedding frequencies", "Time resolved measurement", "Time-dependent flow", "Vortex shedding frequency"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073212973", "SubjectAreas": [["Computational Mechanics", "ENGI", "2206"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes", "CENG", "1507"]], "AuthorData": {"57207873753": {"Name": "Zhang S.", "AuthorID": "57207873753", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Nanoengineered Systems Laboratory, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "33167773300": {"Name": "Naveira-Cotta C.", "AuthorID": "33167773300", "AffiliationID": "60000036", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical Engineering Department (PEM), Federal University of Rio de Janeiro-UFRJ"}, "35323167300": {"Name": "Tiwari M.", "AuthorID": "35323167300", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "55555319600": {"Name": "Cagney N.", "AuthorID": "55555319600", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "6602671760": {"Name": "Balabani S.", "AuthorID": "6602671760", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}}}
