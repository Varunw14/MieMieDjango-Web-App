The formulation is based on Nitsche\u2019s method for weak enforcement of essential boundary conditions together with addition of certain stabilization terms that enable us to establish coercivity and stability of the resulting system of linear equations. We also take geometric approximation of the boundary into account and we focus our presentation on the simply supported boundary conditions which is the most sensitive case for geometric approximation of the boundary.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cut finite element method", "Kirchhoff plate", "Rectangular plate element"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086402595", "SubjectAreas": [["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Engineering (miscellaneous)", "ENGI", "2201"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"7004271452": {"Name": "Burman E.", "AuthorID": "7004271452", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "7004355911": {"Name": "Hansbo P.", "AuthorID": "7004355911", "AffiliationID": "60016471", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping University"}, "7203022296": {"Name": "Larson M.G.", "AuthorID": "7203022296", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics, Ume\u00e5 University"}}}
