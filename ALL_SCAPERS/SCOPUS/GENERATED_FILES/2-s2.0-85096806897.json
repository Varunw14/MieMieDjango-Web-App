Using the \u201chard-sphere\u201d approximation, where the ions are represented by spheres of a fixed radius, we derive four limiting models that each constrain the distances between constituent ions in different ways. We compare the lattice parameters predicted by these four models with experimental data from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD). For the fluorides, the maintenance of the AX bond length at the sum of the A and X radii gives the best approximation of the lattice parameter, leading to structures with widely separated BX6 octahedra. For the heavier halides, a balance between forming an A-site cavity of the correct size and maintaining suitable anion\u2212anion distances determines the lattice parameter. It is found that in many A2BX6 compounds of heavier halides, the neighboring octahedra show very significant anion\u2212anion overlap. We use these models to predict a compound with A-site rattling and use density functional theory (DFT) to confirm this prediction. Finally, we use the geometric models to derive formability criteria for vacancy-ordered double perovskites.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Best approximations", "Constituent ions", "Geometric analysis", "Geometric models", "Hard spheres", "Heavier halides", "Inorganic crystal structure database", "Ordered double perovskites"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096806897", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57220069524": {"Name": "Cheng A.", "AuthorID": "57220069524", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57220072654": {"Name": "Lyu C.", "AuthorID": "57220072654", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57220071304": {"Name": "Shi T.", "AuthorID": "57220071304", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57221406917": {"Name": "Wang Z.", "AuthorID": "57221406917", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "8227436900": {"Name": "Palgrave R.G.", "AuthorID": "8227436900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57214103108": {"Name": "Rahim W.", "AuthorID": "57214103108", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175885", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and, Thomas Young Centre, University College London"}, "16647397400": {"Name": "Scanlon D.O.", "AuthorID": "16647397400", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd."}}}
