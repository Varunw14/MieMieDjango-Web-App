Anaesthesia published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Association of AnaesthetistsThese guidelines aim to ensure that patients with adrenal insufficiency are identified and adequately supplemented with glucocorticoids during the peri-operative period. There are two major categories of adrenal insufficiency. Primary adrenal insufficiency is due to diseases of the adrenal gland (failure of the hormone-producing gland), and secondary adrenal insufficiency is due to deficient adrenocorticotropin hormone secretion by the pituitary gland, or deficient corticotropin-releasing hormone secretion by the hypothalamus (failure of the regulatory centres). Patients taking physiological replacement doses of corticosteroids for either primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency are at significant risk of adrenal crisis and must be given stress doses of hydrocortisone during the peri-operative period. Many more patients other than those with adrenal and hypothalamic\u2013pituitary causes of adrenal failure are receiving glucocorticoids as treatment for other medical conditions. Daily doses of prednisolone of 5 mg or greater in adults and 10\u201315 mg.m\u22122 hydrocortisone equivalent or greater in children may result in hypothalamo\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis suppression if administered for 1 month or more by oral, inhaled, intranasal, intra-articular or topical routes; this chronic administration of glucocorticoids is the most common cause of secondary adrenal suppression, sometimes referred to as tertiary adrenal insufficiency. A pragmatic approach to adrenal replacement during major stress is required; considering the evidence available, blanket recommendations would not be appropriate, and it is essential for the clinician to remember that adrenal replacement dosing following surgical stress or illness is in addition to usual steroid treatment. Patients with previously undiagnosed adrenal insufficiency sometimes present for the first time following the stress of surgery. Anaesthetists must be familiar with the symptoms and signs of acute adrenal insufficiency so that inadequate supplementation or undiagnosed adrenal insufficiency can be detected and treated promptly. Delays may prove fatal.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adrenal insufficiency", "glucocorticoids", "guidelines", "peri-operative medicine", "surgical stress"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adrenal Insufficiency", "Adult", "Child", "Glucocorticoids", "Guidelines as Topic", "Humans", "Perioperative Care", "Prevalence", "Treatment Outcome", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079008949", "SubjectAreas": [["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"57217332981": {"Name": "Woodcock T.", "AuthorID": "57217332981", "AffiliationID": "124283899", "AffiliationName": "Co-Chair, Working Party on behalf of the Association of Anaesthetists"}, "57196837613": {"Name": "Barker P.", "AuthorID": "57196837613", "AffiliationID": "60017129", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital NHS Trust"}, "57215076273": {"Name": "Daniel S.", "AuthorID": "57215076273", "AffiliationID": "60000020", "AffiliationName": "Adult Intensive Care Unit, University Hospital of Wales"}, "7202047937": {"Name": "Fletcher S.", "AuthorID": "7202047937", "AffiliationID": "60017129, 60116802", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital NHS Trust, on behalf of the Royal College of Anaesthetists"}, "7103324354": {"Name": "Wass J.A.H.", "AuthorID": "7103324354", "AffiliationID": "60021328, 60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Endocrinology, Oxford Centre for Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Churchill Hospital, Chair Clinical Reference Group for Endocrinology, on behalf of the Royal College of Physicians"}, "7101990992": {"Name": "Tomlinson J.W.", "AuthorID": "7101990992", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60021328, 60172675", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Centre for Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Churchill Hospital, University of Oxford"}, "7101824672": {"Name": "Misra U.", "AuthorID": "7101824672", "AffiliationID": "60017651", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, Sunderland Royal Hospital"}, "7003534902": {"Name": "Dattani M.", "AuthorID": "7003534902", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Consultant Paediatric Endocrinologist and Head of Clinical Service in Endocrinology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "57216556962": {"Name": "Arlt W.", "AuthorID": "57216556962", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research, University of Birmingham & Centre for Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Birmingham Health Partners, on behalf of the Society for Endocrinology"}, "57218952916": {"Name": "Vercueil A.", "AuthorID": "57218952916", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Intensive Care Medicine, King's College Hospital, Co-Chair, Working Party on behalf of the Association of Anaesthetists"}}}
