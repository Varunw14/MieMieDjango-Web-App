Here we examined country-specific kidney transplantation and graft failure rates in children and explore their country- and patient-level determinants. Patients under 20 years of age initiating kidney replacement therapy from January 2007 through December 2015 in 37 European countries participating in the ESPN/ERA-EDTA Registry were included in the analyses. Countries were categorized as low-, middle-, and high-income based on gross domestic product. At five years of follow-up, 4326 of 6909 children on kidney replacement therapy received their first kidney transplant. Overall median time from kidney replacement therapy start to first kidney transplantation was 1.4 (inter quartile range 0.3-4.3) years. The five-year kidney transplantation probability was 48.8% (95% confidence interval: 45.9-51.7%) in low-income, 76.3% (72.8-79.5%) in middle-income and 92.3% (91.0-93.4%) in high-income countries and was strongly associated with macro-economic factors. Gross domestic product alone explained 67% of the international variation in transplantation rates. Compared with high-income countries, kidney transplantation was 76% less likely to be performed in low-income and 58% less likely in middle-income countries. Overall five-year graft survival in Europe was 88% and showed little variation across countries. Thus, despite large disparities transplantation access across Europe, graft failure rates were relatively similar. Hence, graft survival in low-risk transplant recipients from lower-income countries seems as good as graft survival among all (low-, medium-, and high-risk) graft recipients from high-income countries.", "AuthorKeywords": ["disparities", "end-stage kidney disease", "kidney graft survival", "kidney transplantation", "pediatric nephrology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087923086", "SubjectAreas": [["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"36130877600": {"Name": "Bonthuis M.", "AuthorID": "36130877600", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60117142", "AffiliationName": "ESPN/ERA-EDTA Registry, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Department of Medical Informatics, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute, Meibergdreef 9"}, "57218099301": {"Name": "Cuperus L.", "AuthorID": "57218099301", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60117142", "AffiliationName": "ESPN/ERA-EDTA Registry, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Department of Medical Informatics, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute, Meibergdreef 9"}, "45960892700": {"Name": "Chesnaye N.C.", "AuthorID": "45960892700", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60117142", "AffiliationName": "ESPN/ERA-EDTA Registry, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Department of Medical Informatics, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute, Meibergdreef 9"}, "55382765700": {"Name": "Jager K.J.", "AuthorID": "55382765700", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60117142", "AffiliationName": "ESPN/ERA-EDTA Registry, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Department of Medical Informatics, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute, Meibergdreef 9"}, "7005050235": {"Name": "Akman S.", "AuthorID": "7005050235", "AffiliationID": "60030671", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Nephrology, Akdeniz University Faculty of Medicine"}, "6603128415": {"Name": "Melgar A.A.", "AuthorID": "6603128415", "AffiliationID": "60016890", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Nephrology, La Paz Children's Hospital"}, "56060108700": {"Name": "Baiko S.", "AuthorID": "56060108700", "AffiliationID": "60053292", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Belarusian State Medical University"}, "6602108355": {"Name": "Bouts A.H.", "AuthorID": "6602108355", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Department of Pediatric Nephrology, Emma Children's Academic Medical Center, Meibergdreef 9"}, "57210794658": {"Name": "Groothoff J.W.", "AuthorID": "57210794658", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Department of Pediatric Nephrology, Emma Children's Academic Medical Center, Meibergdreef 9"}, "8509255100": {"Name": "Boyer O.", "AuthorID": "8509255100", "AffiliationID": "60026877, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Nephrology Department, Universit\u00e9 de Paris, H\u00f4pital Necker-Enfants Malades, Assistance Publique H\u00f4pitaux de Paris"}, "57202156324": {"Name": "Dimitrova K.", "AuthorID": "57202156324", "AffiliationID": "60028054", "AffiliationName": "Nephrology and Hemodialysis Clinic, Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of Sofia"}, "57205574491": {"Name": "Carmo C.d.", "AuthorID": "57205574491", "AffiliationID": "60019112", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Nephrology, Hospital Pedi\u00e1trico de Coimbra"}, "13606275800": {"Name": "Grenda R.", "AuthorID": "13606275800", "AffiliationID": "60087496", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, Kidney Transplantation and Hypertension, The Children's Memorial Health Institute"}, "7004499802": {"Name": "Heaf J.", "AuthorID": "7004499802", "AffiliationID": "60136205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Zealand University Hospital"}, "6602193869": {"Name": "Jahnukainen T.", "AuthorID": "6602193869", "AffiliationID": "60016987, 60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Nephrology and Transplantation, Helsinki University Hospital, University of Helsinki"}, "6603408774": {"Name": "Jankauskiene A.", "AuthorID": "6603408774", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Center for Pediatrics, Vilnius University"}, "57204168960": {"Name": "Kaltenegger L.", "AuthorID": "57204168960", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pediatric Nephrology and Gastroenterology, Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Medical University of Vienna"}, "56247970900": {"Name": "Kostic M.", "AuthorID": "56247970900", "AffiliationID": "60068815, 60068827", "AffiliationName": "Medical Faculty, University of Belgrade"}, "8889557300": {"Name": "Marks S.D.", "AuthorID": "8889557300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Nephrology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6508179149": {"Name": "Mitsioni A.", "AuthorID": "6508179149", "AffiliationID": "60081323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, \u201cP. and A.
