Vat photopolymerization 3D printing technology combines the benefits of high resolution and favourable printing speed, offering a sophisticated approach to fabricate bespoke medical devices and drug delivery systems. Herein, an overview of the vat polymerization techniques, their unique applications in the fields of drug delivery and medical device fabrication, material examples and the advantages they provide within healthcare, is provided. The challenges and drawbacks presented by this technology are also discussed. It is forecast that the adoption of 3D printing could pave the way for a personalised health system, advancing from traditional treatments pathways towards digital healthcare.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D printed drug products", "Additive manufacturing", "Personalized pharmaceuticals and medicines", "Photopolymerisation", "Stereolithographic printing", "Stereolithography"], "IndexKeywords": ["3-D printing", "Drug delivery system", "High resolution", "Manufacturing paradigm", "Medical Devices", "Personalised health systems", "Printing speed", "Three-dimensional (3D) printing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094317833", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"57203585474": {"Name": "Xu X.", "AuthorID": "57203585474", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57197865403": {"Name": "Awad A.", "AuthorID": "57197865403", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "56613374000": {"Name": "Robles-Martinez P.", "AuthorID": "56613374000", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "6602683597": {"Name": "Gaisford S.", "AuthorID": "6602683597", "AffiliationID": "60118373", "AffiliationName": "FabRx Ltd."}, "37037477300": {"Name": "Goyanes A.", "AuthorID": "37037477300", "AffiliationID": "60028419", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Farmacolog\u00eda, Farmacia y Tecnolog\u00eda Farmac\u00e9utica, I + D Farma (GI-1645), Facultad de Farmacia, and Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS), Universidade de Santiago de Compostela"}, "7003826707": {"Name": "Basit A.W.", "AuthorID": "7003826707", "AffiliationID": "60118373", "AffiliationName": "FabRx Ltd."}}}
