By comparison, at present, little is known about the role of this cytokine in childhood (non-convulsive) absence epilepsy. The aim of this work was to investigate the potential effects of acute and chronic treatment with tocilizumab (TCZ, 10 and 30 mg/kg/day), on absence seizures, their development, and related psychiatric comorbidity in WAG/Rij rats. It is known that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced changes in inflammatory processes increase absence epileptic activity. In order to study the central effects of TCZ, we investigated whether administration of this anti-IL-6R antibody could modulate the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or IL-6-evoked changes in absence epileptic activity in WAG/Rij rats. Our results demonstrate that TCZ, at both doses, significantly reduced the development of absence seizures in adult WAG/Rij rats at 6 months of age (1 month after treatment suspension) compared with untreated controls, thus showing disease-modifying effects. Decreased absence seizure development at 6 months of age was also accompanied by reduced comorbid depressive-like behavior, whereas no effects were observed on anxiety-related behavior. Acute treatment with TCZ, at 30 mg/kg, had anti-absence properties lasting ~25 h. The co-administration TCZ with i.c.v. LPS or IL-6 showed that TCZ inhibited the worsening of absence seizures induced by both proinflammatory agents in the WAG/Rij rats, supporting a central anti-inflammatory-like protective action. These results suggest the possible role of IL-6 and consequent neuroinflammation in the epileptogenic process underlying the development and maintenance of absence seizures in WAG/Rij rats. Accordingly, IL-6 signaling could be a promising pharmacological target in absence epilepsy and depressive-like comorbidity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Absence epilepsy", "anxiety", "depressive-like behavior", "epileptogenesis", "neuroinflammation", "tocilizumab"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088092042", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"55761723200": {"Name": "Leo A.", "AuthorID": "55761723200", "AffiliationID": "60069616", "AffiliationName": "Science of Health Department, School of Medicine and Surgery, Magna Gr\u00e6cia University of Catanzaro"}, "57208750679": {"Name": "Nesci V.", "AuthorID": "57208750679", "AffiliationID": "60069616", "AffiliationName": "Science of Health Department, School of Medicine and Surgery, Magna Gr\u00e6cia University of Catanzaro"}, "57208759774": {"Name": "Tallarico M.", "AuthorID": "57208759774", "AffiliationID": "60069616", "AffiliationName": "Science of Health Department, School of Medicine and Surgery, Magna Gr\u00e6cia University of Catanzaro"}, "57218161117": {"Name": "Gallo Cantafio E.M.", "AuthorID": "57218161117", "AffiliationID": "60069616", "AffiliationName": "Science of Health Department, School of Medicine and Surgery, Magna Gr\u00e6cia University of Catanzaro"}, "57201386594": {"Name": "De Sarro G.", "AuthorID": "57201386594", "AffiliationID": "60069616", "AffiliationName": "Science of Health Department, School of Medicine and Surgery, Magna Gr\u00e6cia University of Catanzaro"}, "57200140760": {"Name": "Russo E.", "AuthorID": "57200140760", "AffiliationID": "60069616", "AffiliationName": "Science of Health Department, School of Medicine and Surgery, Magna Gr\u00e6cia University of Catanzaro"}, "13806486700": {"Name": "Citraro R.", "AuthorID": "13806486700", "AffiliationID": "60069616", "AffiliationName": "Science of Health Department, School of Medicine and Surgery, Magna Gr\u00e6cia University of Catanzaro"}, "23768213600": {"Name": "Amodio N.", "AuthorID": "23768213600", "AffiliationID": "60069616", "AffiliationName": "Experimental and Clinical Medicine Department, School of Medicine and Surgery, Magna Gr\u00e6cia University"}, "7006013892": {"Name": "Constanti A.", "AuthorID": "7006013892", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacology Department, UCL School of Pharmacy"}}}
