Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Association for Child and Adolescent Mental HealthBackground: In England, all state-funded schools are inspected by an independent government agency, the Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills (Ofsted). Inspections aim to hold schools accountable and to promote the improvement of education, with the results made available to the public. Ofsted reports intend to index school quality, but their influence on students\u2019 individual outcomes has not been previously studied. The aim of the current study was to explore the extent to which school quality, as indexed by Ofsted ratings, is associated with students\u2019 educational achievement, well-being and school engagement. Methods: We use an England population-based sample of 4,391 individuals, for whom school performance at age 11 and GCSE grades at age 16 were accessed from the National Pupil Database, and who completed measures of well-being and school engagement at age 16. Results: We found that Ofsted ratings of secondary school quality accounted for 4% of the variance in students' educational achievement at age 16, which was further reduced to 1% of the variance after we accounted for prior school performance at age 11 and family socioeconomic status. Furthermore, Ofsted ratings were weak predictors of school engagement and student well-being, with an average correlation of.03. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that differences in school quality, as indexed by Ofsted ratings, have little relation to students\u2019 individual outcomes. Accordingly, our results challenge the usefulness of Ofsted ratings as guides for parents and students when choosing secondary schools.", "AuthorKeywords": ["educational achievement", "Ofsted", "school engagement", "School quality", "well-being"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085691150", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"26436419000": {"Name": "von Stumm S.", "AuthorID": "26436419000", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Psychology in Education Research Centre, Department of Education, University of York"}, "6506500146": {"Name": "Asbury K.", "AuthorID": "6506500146", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Psychology in Education Research Centre, Department of Education, University of York"}, "57185766300": {"Name": "Smith-Woolley E.", "AuthorID": "57185766300", "AffiliationID": "121161482", "AffiliationName": "The Physiological Society"}, "57199271963": {"Name": "Cheesman R.", "AuthorID": "57199271963", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "8369960100": {"Name": "Pingault J.B.", "AuthorID": "8369960100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational & Health Psychology, Division of Psychology & Language Sciences, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "57209335477": {"Name": "Plomin R.", "AuthorID": "57209335477", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "7101987679": {"Name": "Dale P.S.", "AuthorID": "7101987679", "AffiliationID": "60033021", "AffiliationName": "Department of Speech and Hearing Sciences, University of New Mexico"}, "7404224559": {"Name": "Allen R.", "AuthorID": "7404224559", "AffiliationID": "60007919", "AffiliationName": "School of Education, University of Brighton"}, "8680670800": {"Name": "Kovas Y.", "AuthorID": "8680670800", "AffiliationID": "60010964", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Goldsmiths, University of London"}}}
