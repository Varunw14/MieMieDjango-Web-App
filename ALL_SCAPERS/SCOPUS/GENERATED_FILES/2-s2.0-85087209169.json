For all the systems, the \u201cinverse-hydration\u201d where the metal center acts as an acceptor of hydrogen bond has been observed. This has motivated to consider the inversely bonded solvent molecule in the definition of the reaction coordinate required to initiate the constrained DFT-MD trajectories. We found that there exists little difference in free enthalpies of activation, such that these platinum-based anticancer drugs are likely to behave the same way in aqueous media. Detailed analysis of the microsolvation structure of the square-planar complexes, along with the key steps of the aquation mechanism, is discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Ensemble simulation", "Microsolvation structures", "Platinum anticancer drugs", "Reaction coordinates", "Solvent molecules", "Square planar complex", "State of the art", "Thermodynamic integration"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087209169", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"]], "AuthorData": {"57195684371": {"Name": "Hirakawa T.", "AuthorID": "57195684371", "AffiliationID": "60102125, 60106844", "AffiliationName": "Institut des Sciences Mol\u00e9culaires (ISM), Universit\u00e9 Bordeaux"}, "56042230400": {"Name": "Morikawa Y.", "AuthorID": "56042230400", "AffiliationID": "60024322", "AffiliationName": "Research Center for Ultra-Precision Science and Technology, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University"}, "16834204500": {"Name": "Truflandier L.A.", "AuthorID": "16834204500", "AffiliationID": "60102125, 60106844", "AffiliationName": "Institut des Sciences Mol\u00e9culaires (ISM), Universit\u00e9 Bordeaux"}, "7006156424": {"Name": "Bowler D.R.", "AuthorID": "7006156424", "AffiliationID": "60002414", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Materials Nanoarchitechtonics (WPI-MANA), National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS)"}, "56052137500": {"Name": "Miyazaki T.", "AuthorID": "56052137500", "AffiliationID": "60002414", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Materials Nanoarchitechtonics (WPI-MANA), National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS)"}}}
