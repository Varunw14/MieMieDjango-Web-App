Cefepime has not been widely studied in combination with BLIs. Sulbactam, with dual BL/BLI activity, has been partnered with very few BLs. We investigated the potential of cefepime/sulbactam as an unorthodox BL/BLI combination against MDR Gram-negative bacteria. Methods: In vitro activity of cefepime/sulbactam (1:1, 1:2 and 2:1) was assessed against 157 strains. Monte Carlo simulation was used to predict the PTA with a number of simulated cefepime combination regimens, modelled across putative cefepime/sulbactam breakpoints (\u226416/\u22640.25 mg/L). Results: Cefepime/sulbactam was more active (MIC50/MIC90 8/8-64/128 mg/L) compared with either drug alone (MIC50/MIC90 128 to >256 mg/L). Activity was enhanced when sulbactam was added at 1:1 or 1:2 (P<0.05). Reduction in MIC was most notable against Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacterales (MIC 8/8-32/64 mg/L). Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling highlighted that up to 48% of all isolates and 73% of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii with a cefepime/sulbactam MIC of \u226416/\u22648 mg/L may be treatable with a high-dose, fixed-ratio (1:1 or 1:2) combination of cefepime/sulbactam. Conclusions: Cefepime/sulbactam (1:1 or 1:2) displays enhanced in vitro activity versus MDR Gram-negative pathogens. It could be a potential alternative to existing BL/BLI combinations for isolates with a cefepime/sulbactam MIC of 16/8 mg/L either as a definitive treatment or as a carbapenem-sparing option.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076450188", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"7004167527": {"Name": "Wareham D.W.", "AuthorID": "7004167527", "AffiliationID": "122988061", "AffiliationName": "Antibiotic Research UK (ANTRUK), York Science Park"}, "57090333700": {"Name": "Momin M.H.F.A.", "AuthorID": "57090333700", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Antimicrobial Research Group, Centre for Immunobiology, Queen Mary University of London"}, "54420882300": {"Name": "Phee L.M.", "AuthorID": "54420882300", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Antimicrobial Research Group, Centre for Immunobiology, Queen Mary University of London"}, "35558739500": {"Name": "Hornsey M.", "AuthorID": "35558739500", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Antimicrobial Research Group, Centre for Immunobiology, Queen Mary University of London"}, "8702431000": {"Name": "Standing J.F.", "AuthorID": "8702431000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, University College London"}}}
