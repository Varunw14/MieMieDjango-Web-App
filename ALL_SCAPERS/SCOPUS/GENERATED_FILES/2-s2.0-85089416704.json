However, only three PINK1 patients with brain autopsy have been reported in the literature. Methods: We describe the clinical and pathological characteristics of a patient with early-onset PD. We screened for copy number variants SNCA, PRKN, PINK1, DJ-1, ATP13A2, LPA and TNFRSF9 by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), and subsequently we performed whole-exome sequencing. Results: Clinically the patient presented with typical parkinsonism that responded well to levodopa. After 23 years of disease she had a bilateral GPi deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. Genetic analyses revealed a heterozygous exon 4\u20135 deletion and a homozygous exon 1 [c. 230T > C (p.Leu77Pro)] mutation in PINK1. Post-mortem neuropathological examination after more than 30 years of disease revealed gliosis and a large loss of melanin-containing neurons in the substantia nigra. Lewy body pathology was evident in substantia nigra, temporal cortex, locus coeruleus and the parahippocampal region. Conclusion: We describe the first clinical and pathological characterization of a PINK1 patient with a typical disease presentation and long disease duration. Previous reports describe two patients with Lewy-related pathologies, albeit with differential distribution, and one patient with no Lewy-related pathology. Hence, it seems that only two patients with parkinsonism due to mutations in PINK1 are consistent with \u03b1-synucleinopathy distribution like that seen in the majority of cases with sporadic PD. Our data further extend the clinicopathological characterization of PINK1-associated PD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deep brain stimulation", "Lewy bodies", "Parkinson's disease", "Pathology", "PINK1"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089416704", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57201645677": {"Name": "Nyb\u00f8 C.J.", "AuthorID": "57201645677", "AffiliationID": "117039506", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, \u00c5lesund Hospital"}, "55959825700": {"Name": "Gustavsson E.K.", "AuthorID": "55959825700", "AffiliationID": "60023052", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, St. Olavs University Hospital"}, "35380197600": {"Name": "Farrer M.J.", "AuthorID": "35380197600", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia"}, "7004207163": {"Name": "Aasly J.O.", "AuthorID": "7004207163", "AffiliationID": "60013141", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Norwegian University of Science and Technology"}}}
