The objective of this study was to test the association between microglial expression of soluble Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 (sTREM2), as a measure of neuroinflammation, and brain atrophy in cognitively unimpaired older adults. Brain magnetic resonance imagings (MRIs) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sTREM2, total tau (t-Tau), phosphorylated181 tau (p-Tau), and A\u03b242 were analyzed in 115 cognitively unimpaired older adults, classified according to the A/T/(N)-framework. MRIs were repeated after 2 (n = 95) and 4 (n = 62) years. High baseline sTREM2 was associated with accelerated cortical thinning in the temporal cortex of the left hemisphere, as well as bilateral hippocampal atrophy, independently of age, A\u03b242, and tau. sTREM2-related atrophy only marginally increased with biomarker positivity across the AD continuum (A-T-#x2292; A+T-#x2292; A+T+) but was significantly stronger in participants with a high level of p-Tau (T+). sTREM2-related cortical thinning correlated significantly with areas of high microglial-specific gene expression in the Allen Human Brain Atlas. In conclusion, increased CSF sTREM2 was associated with accelerated cortical and hippocampal atrophy in cognitively unimpaired older participants, particularly in individuals with tau pathology. This suggests a link between neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and amyloid-independent tauopathy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aging", "Alzheimer's disease", "brain atrophy", "neuroinflammation", "tau"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083913394", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"57204967014": {"Name": "Halaas N.B.", "AuthorID": "57204967014", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo"}, "52463643800": {"Name": "Henjum K.", "AuthorID": "52463643800", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo"}, "57216569705": {"Name": "Dakhil S.", "AuthorID": "57216569705", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo"}, "56798381200": {"Name": "Idland A.V.", "AuthorID": "56798381200", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo"}, "7006685915": {"Name": "Wyller T.B.", "AuthorID": "7006685915", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo"}, "55946965200": {"Name": "Watne L.O.", "AuthorID": "55946965200", "AffiliationID": "60105037", "AffiliationName": "Oslo Delirium Research Group, Department of Geriatric Medicine, Oslo University Hospital"}, "57191481628": {"Name": "Sederevicius D.", "AuthorID": "57191481628", "AffiliationID": "60105037", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Oslo University Hospital"}, "44961535700": {"Name": "Vidal-Pi\u00f1eiro D.", "AuthorID": "44961535700", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Center for Lifespan Changes in Brain and Cognition, University of Oslo"}, "6603364599": {"Name": "Walhovd K.B.", "AuthorID": "6603364599", "AffiliationID": "60105037", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Oslo University Hospital"}, "6601949049": {"Name": "Fjell A.M.", "AuthorID": "6601949049", "AffiliationID": "60105037", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Oslo University Hospital"}, "35592478900": {"Name": "Nilsson L.N.G.", "AuthorID": "35592478900", "AffiliationID": "60105037", "AffiliationName": "Oslo University Hospital"}, "7101909602": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "7101909602", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "57208899083": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "57208899083", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL"}}}
