Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.This research focuses on the adaptive navigation of maritime autonomous surface ships (MASSs) in an uncertain environment. To achieve intelligent obstacle avoidance of MASSs in a port, an autonomous navigation decision-making model based on hierarchical deep reinforcement learning is proposed. The model is mainly composed of two layers: the scene division layer and an autonomous navigation decision-making layer. The scene division layer mainly quantifies the sub-scenarios according to the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREG). This research divides the navigational situation of a ship into entities and attributes based on the ontology model and Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 language. In the decision-making layer, we designed a deep Q-learning algorithm utilizing the environmental model, ship motion space, reward function, and search strategy to learn the environmental state in a quantized sub-scenario to train the navigation strategy. Finally, two sets of verification experiments of the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and improved DRL algorithms were designed with Rizhao port as a study case. Moreover, the experimental data were analyzed in terms of the convergence trend, iterative path, and collision avoidance effect. The results indicate that the improved DRL algorithm could effectively improve the navigation safety and collision avoidance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autonomous navigation", "Collision avoidance", "Decision-making", "Deep reinforcement learning", "Maritime autonomous surface ships", "Scene division"], "IndexKeywords": ["Autonomous navigation", "Decision making models", "International regulations", "Navigation strategies", "Q-learning algorithms", "Scene divisions", "Surface ship", "Uncertain environments"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072573722", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57016254000": {"Name": "Zhang X.", "AuthorID": "57016254000", "AffiliationID": "60029322", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Maritime Dynamic Simulation and Control of Ministry of Transportation, Dalian Maritime University"}, "57208848060": {"Name": "Wang C.", "AuthorID": "57208848060", "AffiliationID": "60029322", "AffiliationName": "Marine Engineering College, Dalian Maritime University"}, "56515441900": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "56515441900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "56596186500": {"Name": "Chen X.", "AuthorID": "56596186500", "AffiliationID": "60176024", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Environmental and Geomatic Engineering"}}}
