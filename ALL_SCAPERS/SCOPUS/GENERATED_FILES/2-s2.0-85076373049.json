However, it is uncertain whether MP-TCP may cause inflammation and scarring of the bulbar conjunctiva. Thus, we aimed to study the histological effects of MP-TCP (compared to controls and continuous wave [CW]-TCP) on the conjunctiva. Our study included 10 Dutch Belted Rabbits that underwent TCP in their right eyes (n = 5, MP-TCP; n = 5, CW-TCP), while their left eyes served as controls. The rabbits were euthanised at 4 weeks, and their dissected globes underwent histopathological and immunohistochemical examination. We observed greater conjunctival inflammation in MP-TCP or CW-TCP-treated eyes compared to controls, but not between each other. The majority of the lymphocytic infiltrates were CD4 T-cells. Increased conjunctival fibrosis was evident in MP-TCP or CW-TCP-treated eyes, to similar extents, compared to controls. However, the increased staining for myofibroblasts was not statistically significant in TCP-treated eyes. We concluded that MP-TCP causes significantly greater overall conjunctival inflammation and scarring compared to controls, similar to CW-TCP. As these are risk-factors for fibrosis and failure of the conjunctival bleb, further studies are required to explore the effect, if any, of post-TCP conjunctival changes on future bleb morphology and survival.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cicatrix", "Ciliary Body", "Conjunctiva", "Female", "Glaucoma", "Intraocular Pressure", "Laser Coagulation", "Rabbits", "Sclera"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076373049", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57195493939": {"Name": "Tan N.Y.Q.", "AuthorID": "57195493939", "AffiliationID": "60008970", "AffiliationName": "Singapore National Eye Centre"}, "23767097100": {"Name": "Ang M.", "AuthorID": "23767097100", "AffiliationID": "60095034", "AffiliationName": "Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences Academic Clinical Program, Duke-NUS Medical School"}, "36058625600": {"Name": "Chan A.S.Y.", "AuthorID": "36058625600", "AffiliationID": "60095034", "AffiliationName": "Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences Academic Clinical Program, Duke-NUS Medical School"}, "23491536600": {"Name": "Barathi V.A.", "AuthorID": "23491536600", "AffiliationID": "60026680, 60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"}, "24279147300": {"Name": "Sng C.C.A.", "AuthorID": "24279147300", "AffiliationID": "60031325", "AffiliationName": "Ophthalmology Department, National University Hospital"}, "7006081241": {"Name": "Tham C.C.", "AuthorID": "7006081241", "AffiliationID": "60014411", "AffiliationName": "Hong Kong Eye Hospital"}, "7007041047": {"Name": "Barton K.", "AuthorID": "7007041047", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College"}}}
