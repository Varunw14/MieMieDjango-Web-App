We develop the calculation of the macroscopic diamagnetic susceptibility tensor, \u03c7cryst, for organic molecular crystals using periodic density functional methods. The crystal magnetic susceptibility tensor, \u03c7cryst, for all experimentally known polymorphs, and its molecular counterpart, \u03c7mol, are calculated for flexible pharmaceuticals such as carbamazepine, flufenamic acid, and chalcones, and rigid molecules, such as benzene, pyridine, acridine, anthracene, and coronene, whose molecular magnetic properties have been traditionally studied. A tensor addition method is developed to approximate the crystal diamagnetic susceptibility tensor, \u03c7cryst, from the molecular one, \u03c7mol, giving good agreement with those calculated directly using the more costly periodic density functional method for \u03c7cryst. The response of pharmaceutical molecules and crystals to magnetic fields, as embodied by \u03c7cryst, is largely determined by the packing in the crystal, as well as the molecular conformation. The anisotropy of \u03c7cryst can vary considerably between polymorphs though the isotropic terms are fairly constant. The implications for developing a computational method for predicting whether crystallization in a magnetic field could produce a novel or different polymorph are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Diamagnetic response", "Diamagnetic susceptibility", "Magnetic susceptibility tensors", "Molecular conformation", "Organic crystal", "Organic molecular crystal", "Periodic density", "Strong magnetic fields", "Crystallization", "Density Functional Theory", "Magnetic Fields", "Molecular Structure", "Particle Size", "Pharmaceutical Preparations", "Polycyclic Compounds", "Polymers", "Surface Properties"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85080845798", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"36056622300": {"Name": "Guo R.", "AuthorID": "36056622300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57215384706": {"Name": "Uddin M.N.", "AuthorID": "57215384706", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7201882352": {"Name": "Price L.S.", "AuthorID": "7201882352", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7202475468": {"Name": "Price S.L.", "AuthorID": "7202475468", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
