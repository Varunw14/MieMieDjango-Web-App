Many URMs have experienced the cumulative stress of being exposed both to the adverse environmental conditions which drive forced migration, and to the traumatic experience of displacement and resettlement. These experiences, coupled with other developmental stressors, may impede their overall development and increase their likelihood of mental health problems. Despite the evident vulnerability of URMs, much controversy currently surrounds the legitimacy of their arrival in host countries and their mental health is given little consideration. Objective: This review synthesises and examines the limited published literature on the impact of traumatic refugee experiences on the mental health and development of URMs. Methods: Academic databases and other sources were searched using key terms relating to URMs and mental health. Results: The findings confirm in large part that being a URM negatively influences mental health development, and that adolescence and being female are particular indicators of increased risk of psychiatric disorders. However, cultural differences in measurement and assessment of mental health are important confounding factors. Conclusions: The current literature on youth in transit consistently paints a picture of how experiences URMs face can place a great burden on their mental health - clearly depicting an urgent need to consider their mental health within the current climate. The pressing need for improved care based on best practice is discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Asylum-seekers", "Development", "Mental health", "Minors", "Refugees", "Unaccompanied"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Europe", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Health", "Minors", "Personal Satisfaction", "Refugees", "Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072016047", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57204951069": {"Name": "von Werthern M.", "AuthorID": "57204951069", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Child and Adolescent Mental Health, UCL Great Ormond Street Institue for Child Health"}, "57210964611": {"Name": "Grigorakis G.", "AuthorID": "57210964611", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Child and Adolescent Mental Health, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute for Child Heatlh"}, "55887912800": {"Name": "Vizard E.", "AuthorID": "55887912800", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}}}
