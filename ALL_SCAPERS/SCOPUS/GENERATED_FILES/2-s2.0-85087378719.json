Our results showed that it was possible to infect chicken embryos with Staphylococcus aureus, one of the main types of bacteria found in the persistent infection associated with chronic wounds, and maintain the embryos\u2019 survival for up to 48 h. Survival of the embryos varied with the dose of bacteria inoculum and with the use and time of streptomycin application after infection. In infected yet viable embryos, the blood vessels network of the CAM was maintained with minimal disruption. Microbiological tests could confirm embryo infection, but quantification was difficult. By publishing these preliminary results, we hope that not only our group but others within the scientific community further this research towards the establishment of biomimetic and reproducible ex vivo models of persistent infection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomaterials", "Chick embryo CAM", "Chronic wounds", "Ex ovo", "Infection"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087378719", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"55375422500": {"Name": "Garc\u00eda-Gareta E.", "AuthorID": "55375422500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013985", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "57217531703": {"Name": "Binkowska J.", "AuthorID": "57217531703", "AffiliationID": "60022734, 60189084", "AffiliationName": "Regenerative Biomaterials Group, RAFT Institute, Griffin Institute, Northwick Park and Saint Mark\u2019s Hospitals"}, "57191580990": {"Name": "Kohli N.", "AuthorID": "57191580990", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Biomechanics Research Group, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Imperial Collage London, South Kensington Campus"}, "56390982500": {"Name": "Sharma V.", "AuthorID": "56390982500", "AffiliationID": "60022734, 60189084", "AffiliationName": "Regenerative Biomaterials Group, RAFT Institute, Griffin Institute, Northwick Park and Saint Mark\u2019s Hospitals"}}}
