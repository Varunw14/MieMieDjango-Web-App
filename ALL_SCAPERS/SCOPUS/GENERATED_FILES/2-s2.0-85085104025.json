This fact has given rise to a rather simple but remarkably useful numerical approach to simulate the dynamics of quantum many-body systems, called dynamical quantum typicality (DQT). In this paper, we give a brief overview of selected applications of DQT, where particular emphasis is given to questions on transport and thermalization in low-dimensional lattice systems like chains or ladders of interacting spins or fermions. For these systems, we discuss that DQT provides an efficient means to obtain time-dependent equilibrium correlation functions for comparatively large Hilbert-space dimensions and long time scales, allowing the quantitative extraction of transport coefficients within the framework of, e. g., linear response theory (LRT). Furthermore, it is discussed that DQT can also be used to study the far-from-equilibrium dynamics resulting from sudden quench scenarios, where the initial state is a thermal Gibbs state of the pre-quench Hamiltonian. Eventually, we summarize a few combinations of DQT with other approaches such as numerical linked cluster expansions or projection operator techniques. In this way, we demonstrate the versatility of DQT.", "AuthorKeywords": ["low-dimensional lattice models", "numerical simulation", "quantum many-body dynamics", "quantum typicality", "transport and thermalization"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085104025", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematical Physics", "MATH", "2610"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57212249085": {"Name": "Heitmann T.", "AuthorID": "57212249085", "AffiliationID": "60009731", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Osnabr\u00fcck"}, "57202418311": {"Name": "Richter J.", "AuthorID": "57202418311", "AffiliationID": "60009731", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Osnabr\u00fcck"}, "57216876377": {"Name": "Schubert D.", "AuthorID": "57216876377", "AffiliationID": "60009731", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Osnabr\u00fcck"}, "22636326900": {"Name": "Steinigeweg R.", "AuthorID": "22636326900", "AffiliationID": "60009731", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Osnabr\u00fcck"}}}
