Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases, and in particular the PI4KIII\u03b2 isoform, act in concert with PI4P to recruit macromolecular complexes to initiate the biogenesis of trafficking vesicles for several Golgi exit routes. Dysregulation of Golgi PI4P metabolism and the PI4P protein interactome features in many cancers and is often associated with tumour progression and a poor prognosis. Increased expression of PI4P-binding proteins, such as GOLPH3 or PITPNC1, induces a malignant secretory phenotype and the release of proteins that can remodel the extracellular matrix, promote angiogenesis and enhance cell motility. Aberrant Golgi PI4P metabolism can also result in the impaired post-translational modification of proteins required for focal adhesion formation and cell-matrix interactions, thereby potentiating the development of aggressive metastatic and invasive tumours. Altered expression of the Golgi-targeted PI 4-kinases, PI4KIII\u03b2, PI4KII\u03b1 and PI4KII\u03b2, or the PI4P phosphate Sac1, can also modulate oncogenic signalling through effects on TGN-endosomal trafficking. A Golgi trafficking role for a PIP 5-kinase has been recently described, which indicates that PI4P is not the only functionally important phosphoinositide at this subcellular location. This review charts new developments in our understanding of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase function at the Golgi and how PI4P-dependent trafficking can be deregulated in malignant disease.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["1-Phosphatidylinositol 4-Kinase", "Animals", "Golgi Apparatus", "Humans", "Membrane Proteins", "Membrane Transport Proteins", "Neoplasm Proteins", "Neoplasms", "Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates", "Secretory Vesicles"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071637969", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"35563939800": {"Name": "Waugh M.G.", "AuthorID": "35563939800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lipid and Membrane Biology Group, Division of Medicine, UCL, Floor U3, Royal Free Campus"}}}
