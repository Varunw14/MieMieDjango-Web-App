However, the efficacy of tele-health in COPD is still controversial. Despite this, there appears to be widespread adoption of this technology. Aim: To explore the international use of tele-heath for COPD, to assess the perceptions of clinicians employing tele-health in COPD, and to summarize the techniques that have been used by health care providers to personalize alarm limits for patients with COPD enrolled on tele-health programs. Methods: A cross-sectional survey consisting of 15 questions was distributed and advertised to health care professionals worldwide. Questions were designed to cover five different aspects of tele-health in COPD: purpose of use, equipment type, clinician perceptions, variables monitored, and personalization of alarm limits. Results: A total of 138 participants completed the survey from 29 different countries. As high as 59% of the participants had ever used tele-health for COPD, and 33% still provided tele-health services to patients with COPD. Tele-health was most commonly used for baseline monitoring, with 90% believing it to be effective. The three most commonly monitored variables were oxygen saturation, heart rate, and the use of rescue medication. Conclusion: Twenty-nine different countries use tele-health for managing COPD and therefore there is widespread international use of tele-health in COPD. The majority of providers thought tele-health was effective despite evidence to the contrary.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alarm limits", "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease", "COPD", "Home monitoring", "Perception", "Tele-health"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cross-Sectional Studies", "Disease Management", "Follow-Up Studies", "Health Care Surveys", "Health Personnel", "Humans", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive", "Retrospective Studies", "Telemedicine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072384254", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57210375316": {"Name": "Alrajeh A.M.", "AuthorID": "57210375316", "AffiliationID": "60030736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Respiratory Care, King Faisal University"}, "57206726993": {"Name": "Aldabayan Y.S.", "AuthorID": "57206726993", "AffiliationID": "60030736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Respiratory Care, King Faisal University"}, "57211048928": {"Name": "Aldhair A.M.", "AuthorID": "57211048928", "AffiliationID": "60106293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Respiratory Care, Jazan University"}, "57201381285": {"Name": "Pickett E.", "AuthorID": "57201381285", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Respiratory, University College London"}, "56113018900": {"Name": "Quaderi S.A.", "AuthorID": "56113018900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Respiratory, University College London"}, "57202039470": {"Name": "Alqahtani J.S.", "AuthorID": "57202039470", "AffiliationID": "110183310", "AffiliationName": "Department of Respiratory Care, Prince Sultan Military College of Health Sciences"}, "57195311478": {"Name": "Lipman M.", "AuthorID": "57195311478", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Respiratory, University College London"}, "57201513306": {"Name": "Hurst J.R.", "AuthorID": "57201513306", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Respiratory, University College London"}}}
