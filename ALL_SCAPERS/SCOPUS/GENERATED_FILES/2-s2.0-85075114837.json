A key challenge is to understand why some people struggle with speech-in-noise perception, despite having clinically normal hearing. Here, we developed new figure-ground tests that require participants to extract a coherent tone pattern from a stochastic background of tones. These tests dissociated variability in speech-in-noise perception related to mechanisms for detecting static (same-frequency) patterns and those for tracking patterns that change frequency over time. In addition, elevated hearing thresholds that are widely considered to be \u2018normal\u2019 explained significant variance in speech-in-noise perception, independent of figure-ground perception. Overall, our results demonstrate that successful speech-in-noise perception is related to audiometric thresholds, fundamental grouping of static acoustic patterns, and tracking of acoustic sources that change in frequency. Crucially, speech-in-noise deficits are better assessed by measuring central (grouping) processes alongside audiometric thresholds.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Audiometry, Speech", "Auditory Threshold", "Female", "Hearing Tests", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Noise", "Perceptual Masking", "Speech Perception", "Stochastic Processes", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075114837", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57189340121": {"Name": "Holmes E.", "AuthorID": "57189340121", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL"}, "7102183421": {"Name": "Griffiths T.D.", "AuthorID": "7102183421", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience, Newcastle University"}}}
