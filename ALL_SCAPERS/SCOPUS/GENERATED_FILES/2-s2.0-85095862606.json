METHODS: All adult patients who underwent TIPSS insertion for refractory ascites between 2010 and 2018 were included. Skeletal muscle index at L3 was used to determine sarcopenia status. RESULTS: One hundred seven patients were followed for 14.2 months. Sarcopenia was present in 57% of patients. No patient had history of pre-TIPSS hepatic encephalopathy (HE). De novo HE occurred in 30% of patients. On multivariate analysis, only platelet count and L3-SMI predicted de novo HE. On multivariate analysis, age and model for end-stage liver disease with sodium predicted mortality, whereas L3-SMI and sarcopenia did not. In patients with repeat imaging, L3-SMI improved significantly post-TIPSS compared with baseline. DISCUSSION: Sarcopenia should not be considered as a contraindication to TIPSS insertion in refractory ascites because it is not associated with de novo HE or increased mortality.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Ascites", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Hepatic Encephalopathy", "Humans", "Liver Cirrhosis", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Paracentesis", "Portasystemic Shunt, Transjugular Intrahepatic", "Prognosis", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Psoas Muscles", "Recurrence", "Retrospective Studies", "Sarcopenia", "Survival Rate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095862606", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"57219874235": {"Name": "Benmassaoud A.", "AuthorID": "57219874235", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College of London"}, "22958739600": {"Name": "Roccarina D.", "AuthorID": "22958739600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College of London"}, "57219874771": {"Name": "Arico F.", "AuthorID": "57219874771", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College of London"}, "57219874639": {"Name": "Yu B.", "AuthorID": "57219874639", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College of London"}, "57219875657": {"Name": "Cheng F.", "AuthorID": "57219875657", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College of London"}, "7003739447": {"Name": "Patch D.", "AuthorID": "7003739447", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College of London"}, "16023392700": {"Name": "Tsochatzis E.", "AuthorID": "16023392700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College of London"}, "7007165323": {"Name": "Leandro G.", "AuthorID": "7007165323", "AffiliationID": "112608085", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Gastroenterology, S.
