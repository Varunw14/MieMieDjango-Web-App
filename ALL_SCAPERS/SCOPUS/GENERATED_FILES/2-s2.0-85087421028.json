A small number of ocular complications have been reported. We present the unique findings in a patient who had molecular confirmation of AKT1 mosaicism alongside fulfilling the clinical criteria for Proteus syndrome. Methods: Pattern electroretinography, visual evoked potentials and multifocal electroretinography testing were performed alongside detailed retinal imaging and clinical examination to detail the ophthalmic characteristics. Results: Electrophysiological findings characterised unilateral macular dysfunction alongside sector retinal dysfunction of the right eye. This was demonstrated through optical coherence tomography and ultra-wide-field imaging to be associated with a misaligned foveal morphology and sector retinal dysfunction extending into the temporal retina. Conclusion: We propose this patient has asymmetric foveal development and concomitant sector retinal dysfunction as the result of the mosaic AKT1 mutation, either through disruption in the retinal PI3K-AKT1 signalling pathway or through mechanical distortion of ocular growth, resulting in disproportionate inner retinal development. The findings expand the ocular phenotype of Proteus syndrome and encourage early assessment to identify any incipient ocular abnormalities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AKT1", "Foveal misalignment", "Mosaic", "Mosaicism", "Multifocal", "Pattern electroretinogram", "Proteus syndrome"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087421028", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"57208050749": {"Name": "Marmoy O.R.", "AuthorID": "57208050749", "AffiliationID": "60022046", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Metropolitan University"}, "23476862600": {"Name": "Henderson R.H.", "AuthorID": "23476862600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL-GOSH Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "55553818000": {"Name": "Handley S.E.", "AuthorID": "55553818000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL-GOSH Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7403102020": {"Name": "Moore W.", "AuthorID": "7403102020", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Clinical and Academic Department of Ophthalmology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "7404935216": {"Name": "Thompson D.A.", "AuthorID": "7404935216", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL-GOSH Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "6506836269": {"Name": "Kinsler V.A.", "AuthorID": "6506836269", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL-GOSH Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
