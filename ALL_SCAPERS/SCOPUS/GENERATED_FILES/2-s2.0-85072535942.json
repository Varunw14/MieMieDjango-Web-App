Consequently, the UK government announced its intention to ban diesel vehicles by 2040 to achieve a sustainable zero-carbon road transport system. Since no empirical studies have used a bottom-up approach to seek Londoners\u2019 views, it is therefore worth investigating the public opinion regarding this forthcoming ban. This paper aims to fill this research gap by taking London as a case study. A survey was designed, and fieldwork was conducted to distribute questionnaires to Londoners. Completed questionnaires were analysed using both quantitative and qualitative methods. The findings revealed that the majority of Londoners would be in favour of the ban if they were sufficiently exposed to the appropriate sources of information and were favourably disposed towards environmental protection measures. The results also showed that Londoners were more likely to switch to electric vehicles (EVs) if they were offered generous incentives and encouraged to use scrappage schemes. The present study makes a strong case for enforcing the ban well before 2040. The significance of this research is to provide clearer signals regarding the future of diesel vehicles, which in turn will strengthen the EV policy and uptake.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Air pollution", "Decarbonisation", "Diesel ban", "Electric vehicles", "London", "Low carbon technologies", "Low carbon transition", "Transport planning", "Transport policy", "Zero carbon"], "IndexKeywords": ["Decarbonisation", "Diesel ban", "London", "Low-carbon technologies", "Low-carbon transitions", "Transport planning", "Transport policy", "Zero carbons"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072535942", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Energy (miscellaneous)", "ENER", "2101"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57211063330": {"Name": "Shammut M.", "AuthorID": "57211063330", "AffiliationID": "60008221", "AffiliationName": "School of People, Environment and Planning, Massey University"}, "57193545823": {"Name": "Cao M.", "AuthorID": "57193545823", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Planning, University College London"}, "57207781228": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "57207781228", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College London"}, "57202628780": {"Name": "Gao X.", "AuthorID": "57202628780", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Planning, University College London"}, "56674776800": {"Name": "Papaix C.", "AuthorID": "56674776800", "AffiliationID": "60021889", "AffiliationName": "Department of Systems Management and Strategy, University of Greenwich"}, "56946494800": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "56946494800", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Work and Social Administration, University of Hong Kong"}}}
