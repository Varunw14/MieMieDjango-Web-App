Most authorities recommend excision of the fused area with glans resurfacing, although partial circumcision is often performed. Objective: To evaluate an alternative technique that preserves the fused area and allows a complete circumcision without grafting. Design, setting, and participants: Over 3 yr (January 2016\u2014March 2018), 28 men (age 28\u201393 yr; mean 62 yr) underwent the restoration of lost obscured coronal sulcus (ROLOCS) procedure with over 1 yr of follow-up. Complications were reviewed retrospectively with an additional survey. Surgical procedure: The shaft skin is incised at the corona. Dartos is divided, which allows antegrade dissection just outside the fused glans membrane. The foreskin is removed and shaft skin sutured to dartos below the corona. Measurements: Postoperative pain, aesthetic satisfaction, sexual enjoyment, glans sensation, and urinary symptoms were measured. Results and limitations: There were no major complications. In all cases, the coronal sulcus was restored and the glans skin became soft without skin grafting. All were satisfied with the aesthetics. Of the patients, <70% experienced mild to low-moderate pain; 55% and 25% had, respectively, improved or reduced glans sensation; and 40% reported improved enjoyment of sex. Histology showed LS in all cases with squamous cell carcinoma in four, including three out of five patients who had previously undergone partial circumcision. Although this is the largest series reported yet, the numbers were too small for a meaningful statistical analysis. Conclusions: The ROLOCS operation offers an aesthetically superior alternative to partial circumcision and is easier to perform with less morbidity than skin grafting. Patient summary: The restoration of lost obscured coronal sulcus (ROLOCS) procedure provides an alternative to partial circumcision or circumcision with skin grafting when the foreskin is welded to the head of the penis (glans) due to lichen sclerosus. It produces a good cosmetic result, but the glans can be sore until it heals.\u00a9 2020 European Association of UrologyIn patients with lichen sclerosus, where the foreskin and glans are fused, it is not necessary to resurface the glans when performing a circumcision, provided that the fused layer is preserved.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Circumcision", "Glans reconstruction", "Lichen sclerosus", "Penile cancer", "Preputial adhesions", "Restoration of lost obscured coronal sulcus"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086393996", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"21934918700": {"Name": "Skrodzka M.", "AuthorID": "21934918700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital"}, "57217137102": {"Name": "Morgenstern S.", "AuthorID": "57217137102", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital"}, "57205001739": {"Name": "Hadway P.", "AuthorID": "57205001739", "AffiliationID": "60007312", "AffiliationName": "Royal Berkshire Hospital"}, "24339107700": {"Name": "Muneer A.", "AuthorID": "24339107700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital"}, "7102425111": {"Name": "Malone P.R.", "AuthorID": "7102425111", "AffiliationID": "60007312", "AffiliationName": "Royal Berkshire Hospital"}, "57217128567": {"Name": "Britnell W.", "AuthorID": "57217128567", "AffiliationID": "60007312", "AffiliationName": "Royal Berkshire Hospital"}, "57217128405": {"Name": "Ayers J.", "AuthorID": "57217128405", "AffiliationID": "60007312", "AffiliationName": "Royal Berkshire Hospital"}, "57217138160": {"Name": "Rea A.", "AuthorID": "57217138160", "AffiliationID": "60007312", "AffiliationName": "Royal Berkshire Hospital"}}}
