This multicentre cohort study reports on risk factors associated with perioperative morbidity and mortality in 422 patients (340 COVID-19-negative vs 82 COVID-19-positive) undergoing hip fracture surgery during the pandemic. Treatment groups were comparable for age, sex, body mass index, fracture configuration, and type of surgery performed. Predefined perioperative outcomes were recorded within a 30-day postoperative period. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard modelling was used to identify risk factors associated with increased risk of mortality. COVID-19-positive patients had increased postoperative mortality rates compared to COVID- 19- negative patients (30.5% (25/82) vs 10.3% (35/340) respectively, p < 0.001). Risk factors for increased perioperative mortality in patients with COVID-19 included positive smoking status (hazard ratio (HR) 15.4 (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.55 to 52.2; p < 0.001) and greater than three medical comorbidities (HR 13.5 (95% CI 2.82 to 66.0, p < 0.001). COVID-19-positive patients had increased risk of postoperative complications (89.0% (73/82) vs 35.0% (119/340) respectively; p < 0.001), more critical care unit admissions (61.0% (50/82) versus 18.2% (62/340) respectively; p < 0.001), and increased length of hospital stay (mean 13.8 days (standard deviation (SD) 4.6) versus 6.7 days (SD 2.5) respectively; p < 0.001), compared to COVID-19-negative patients. Hip fracture surgery in COVID-19-positive patients is associated with increased perioperative morbidity and mortality rates compared to COVID-19-negative patients. Risk factors for increased mortality in patients with COVID-19 undergoing surgery included positive smoking status and multiple (more than three) comorbidities.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Betacoronavirus", "Coronavirus Infections", "Fracture Fixation", "Global Health", "Hip Fractures", "Humans", "Morbidity", "Pandemics", "Perioperative Period", "Pneumonia, Viral", "Survival Rate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092454020", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"53979939900": {"Name": "Kayani B.", "AuthorID": "53979939900", "AffiliationID": "60027403, 60010088", "AffiliationName": "University College Hospital, Royal London Hospital"}, "7201982018": {"Name": "Bates P.", "AuthorID": "7201982018", "AffiliationID": "60027403, 60010088", "AffiliationName": "University College Hospital, Royal London Hospital"}, "57211988009": {"Name": "Onochie E.", "AuthorID": "57211988009", "AffiliationID": "60014048, 60020849", "AffiliationName": "Newham University Hospital, Whipps Cross Hospital"}, "55933673200": {"Name": "Patil V.", "AuthorID": "55933673200", "AffiliationID": "60170321", "AffiliationName": "Basildon University Hospital"}, "57205729820": {"Name": "Begum F.", "AuthorID": "57205729820", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "University College Hospital"}, "57197835360": {"Name": "Cuthbert R.", "AuthorID": "57197835360", "AffiliationID": "60007937", "AffiliationName": "Queen's Hospital"}, "21133997200": {"Name": "Ferguson D.", "AuthorID": "21133997200", "AffiliationID": "60022873", "AffiliationName": "King George Hospital"}, "49962846400": {"Name": "Bhamra J.S.", "AuthorID": "49962846400", "AffiliationID": "60032639", "AffiliationName": "Wexham Park Hospital"}, "56149816200": {"Name": "Sharma A.", "AuthorID": "56149816200", "AffiliationID": "60015343", "AffiliationName": "Hillingdon Hospital"}, "7203033976": {"Name": "Haddad F.S.", "AuthorID": "7203033976", "AffiliationID": "60027403, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College Hospital, NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at UCLH"}}}
