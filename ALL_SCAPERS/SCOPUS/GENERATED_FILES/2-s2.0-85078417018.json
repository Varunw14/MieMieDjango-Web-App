Methods: This study was determined by an institutional review board to be \u201cexempt\u201d research. The survey consisted of 70 questions about CTE/MRE patient preparation, administration of contrast materials, imaging techniques, and other protocol details. The survey was administered to DFP members using SurveyMonkey\u00ae (Surveymonkey.com). Descriptive statistical analyses were performed. Results: Responses were received from 16 DFP institutions (3 non-USA, 2 pediatric); 15 (94%) were academic/university-based. 10 (63%) Institutions image most CD patients with MRE; 4 (25%) use CTE and MRE equally. Hypoperistaltic medication is given for MRE at 13 (81%) institutions versus only 2 (13%) institutions for CTE. Most institutions have a technologist or nurse monitor oral contrast material drinking (n = 12 for CTE, 75%; n = 11 for MRE, 69%). 2 (13%) institutions use only dual-energy capable scanners for CTE, while 9 (56%) use either a single-energy or dual-energy scanner based on availability. Axial CTE images are reconstructed at 2\u20133 mm thickness at 8 (50%) institutions, > 3 mm at 5 (31%), and < 2 mm at 3 (19%) institutions. 13 (81%) institutions perform MRE on either 1.5 or 3T scanners without preference. All institutions perform MRE multiphase postcontrast imaging (median = 4 phases), ranging from 20 to 600 s after contrast material injection. Conclusion: CTE and MRE protocol knowledge from DFP institutions can help radiology practices optimize/standardize protocols, potentially improving image quality and patient outcomes, permitting objective comparisons between examinations, and facilitating research.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Crohn\u2019s disease", "Crohn\u2019s Disease-Focused Panel", "CT enterography", "MR enterography"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078417018", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"], ["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"8234875300": {"Name": "Gandhi N.S.", "AuthorID": "8234875300", "AffiliationID": "60021160", "AffiliationName": "Imaging Institute, Cleveland Clinic"}, "7403075441": {"Name": "Baker M.E.", "AuthorID": "7403075441", "AffiliationID": "60021160", "AffiliationName": "Imaging Institute, Cleveland Clinic"}, "16425581500": {"Name": "Dillman J.R.", "AuthorID": "16425581500", "AffiliationID": "60017412, 60030440", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine"}, "7004005236": {"Name": "Grand D.J.", "AuthorID": "7004005236", "AffiliationID": "60017866", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Rhode Island Hospital"}, "57192829699": {"Name": "Huang C.", "AuthorID": "57192829699", "AffiliationID": "60032105", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, New York University Langone Health"}, "7402937851": {"Name": "Fletcher J.G.", "AuthorID": "7402937851", "AffiliationID": "60005558", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic"}, "7102924315": {"Name": "Fidler J.L.", "AuthorID": "7102924315", "AffiliationID": "60005558", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic"}, "16244388800": {"Name": "Al-Hawary M.M.", "AuthorID": "16244388800", "AffiliationID": "60007200", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University of Michigan Health System"}, "6603575783": {"Name": "Anupindi S.A.", "AuthorID": "6603575783", "AffiliationID": "60030118, 60006297", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia & University of Pennsylvania"}, "16833358400": {"Name": "Bruining D.H.", "AuthorID": "16833358400", "AffiliationID": "60005558", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic"}, "36463063700": {"Name": "Chatterji M.", "AuthorID": "36463063700", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine"}, "14035619000": {"Name": "Gee M.S.", "AuthorID": "14035619000", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60029929", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "57209779792": {"Name": "Grajo J.R.", "AuthorID": "57209779792", "AffiliationID": "60007567", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University of Florida College of Medicine"}, "24369020300": {"Name": "Guglielmo F.F.", "AuthorID": "24369020300", "AffiliationID": "60032333", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Thomas Jefferson University Hospital"}, "12782660800": {"Name": "Jaffe T.A.", "AuthorID": "12782660800", "AffiliationID": "60113147", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Duke University Medical Center"}, "57049729900": {"Name": "Park S.H.", "AuthorID": "57049729900", "AffiliationID": "60006240, 60068691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine"}, "12801375500": {"Name": "Rimola J.", "AuthorID": "12801375500", "AffiliationID": "60030315", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Hospital Cl\u00ednic of Barcelona"}, "6701595965": {"Name": "Taouli B.", "AuthorID": "6701595965", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}, "57203543924": {"Name": "Taylor S.A.", "AuthorID": "57203543924", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "7005394710": {"Name": "Yeh B.", "AuthorID": "7005394710", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University of California"}}}
