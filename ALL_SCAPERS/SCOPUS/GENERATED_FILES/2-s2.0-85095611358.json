While Mo-containing medium pore zeolites have been widely studied for methane dehydroaromatisation (MDA), the use of small pore supports has drawn limited attention due to the fast deactivation of the catalyst. This work investigates the structure of the small pore Mo/H-SSZ-13 during catalyst preparation and reaction by operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in situ synchrotron powder diffraction (SPD), and electron microscopy; then, the results are compared with the medium pore Mo/H-ZSM-5. While SPD suggests that during catalyst preparation, part of the MoOx anchors inside the pores, Mo dispersion and subsequent ion exchange was less effective in the small pore catalyst, resulting in the formation of mesopores and Al2(MOO4)3 particles. Unlike Mo/H-ZSM-5, part of the Mo species in Mo/H-SSZ-13 undergoes full reduction to Mo0 during MDA, whereas characterisation of the spent catalyst indicates that differences also exist in the nature of the formed carbon deposits. Hence, the different Mo speciation and the low performance on small pore zeolites can be attributed to mesopores formation during calcination and the ineffective ion exchange into well dispersed Mo-oxo sites. The results open the scope for the optimisation of synthetic routes to explore the potential of small pore topologies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["MDA", "Mo/CHA", "operando XAS/XRD"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095611358", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Chemistry (miscellaneous)", "CHEM", "1601"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"57219799587": {"Name": "Agote-Ar\u00e1n M.", "AuthorID": "57219799587", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": null}, "16401902100": {"Name": "Lezcano-Gonz\u00e1lez I.", "AuthorID": "16401902100", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "8889480300": {"Name": "Beale A.M.", "AuthorID": "8889480300", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "55372640600": {"Name": "Kroner A.B.", "AuthorID": "55372640600", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": null}, "6603019460": {"Name": "Wragg D.S.", "AuthorID": "6603019460", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, NGAP Centre for Research Based Innovation, University of Oslo"}, "8562701100": {"Name": "S\u0142awi\u0144ski W.A.", "AuthorID": "8562701100", "AffiliationID": "60013756", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Physics, University of Warsaw"}, "24723395100": {"Name": "Briceno M.", "AuthorID": "24723395100", "AffiliationID": "60027782", "AffiliationName": null}, "55683301600": {"Name": "Islam H.U.", "AuthorID": "55683301600", "AffiliationID": "60027782", "AffiliationName": null}, "7102419422": {"Name": "Rivas M.E.", "AuthorID": "7102419422", "AffiliationID": "60027782", "AffiliationName": null}, "57221244826": {"Name": "Smith A.W.J.", "AuthorID": "57221244826", "AffiliationID": "60027782", "AffiliationName": null}, "54419832100": {"Name": "Collier P.", "AuthorID": "54419832100", "AffiliationID": "60027782", "AffiliationName": null}, "6603168710": {"Name": "Sazanovich I.V.", "AuthorID": "6603168710", "AffiliationID": "60009523", "AffiliationName": "Central Laser Facility, Research Complex at Harwell, Science and Technology Facilities Council"}}}
