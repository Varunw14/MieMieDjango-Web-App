Immunology published by John Wiley & Sons LtdOur barrier surfaces are fundamental in protecting us from the outside world and segregating key biological processes. The immunological fortifications found at these sites therefore possess many distinct qualities, which are discussed in Immunology's series of reviews on Barrier Immunity. Together these reviews showcase novel biological processes identified through the use of state-of-the-art technologies, and specifically highlight how these change throughout our lives.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aging", "Female", "Genitalia, Female", "Humans", "Immunity", "Liver", "Microbiota", "Skin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084433378", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"23008804000": {"Name": "Harker J.A.", "AuthorID": "23008804000", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "55613142700": {"Name": "Pallett L.J.", "AuthorID": "55613142700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London"}}}
