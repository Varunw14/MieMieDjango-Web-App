However, few studies describe how the SRPS has been adapted and validated for use within global youth sexual health studies. We examined gender-specific psychometric properties, reliability, and validity of a SRPS used within a South African youth-engaged cohort study. Methods Young men and women (16\u201324 years) enrolled in community-based cohorts in Durban and Soweto (2014\u20132016) reporting a primary partner at 6-month follow-up completed a 13-item (strongly agree/agree/disagree/strongly disagree) South African adaptation of Pulerwitz\u2019s SRPS (range 13\u201352, higher scores indicating greater sexual relationship power [SRP] equity). SRPS modifications were made using gender-specific exploratory factor analyses (EFAs), removing items with factor loadings <0.3. Cronbach alphas were conducted for full and modified scales by gender. Using modified scales, unadjusted and adjusted regression models examined associations between 1. relevant socio-demographic and relationship determinants and SRP equity, and 2. SRP equity and sexual relationship related outcomes. All models adjusted for education, age, site, and current employment. Results 235 sexually-active youth (66% women, median age = 20) were included. Mean scores across all 13 scale items were 2.71 (SD 0.30) for women and 2.70 (SD 0.4) for men. Scale Cronbach\u2019s alphas were 0.63 for women and 0.64 for men. EFAs resulted in two gender-specific single-factor SRPS. Modified SRPS Cronbach alphas increased to 0.67 for women (8-items) and 0.70 for men (9-items). After adjusting for age, site and current employment, higher education remained associated with SRP equity across genders. In adjusted models, correlates of SRP equity included primary partnerships that were age-similar (<5 years older) and <2 years in length for women and living in Soweto and younger age for men. Greater SRP equity among women was also independently associated with no recent partner violence. Conclusions Results highlight important gender differences in SRP equity measures and associations, highlighting the critically need for future research to examine gendered constructions of SRP equity in order to accurately develop, validate and use appropriate measures within quantitative surveys.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Factor Analysis, Statistical", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Interpersonal Relations", "Intimate Partner Violence", "Male", "Power, Psychological", "Psychometrics", "Risk Factors", "Sex Factors", "Sexual Behavior", "Sexual Partners", "Socioeconomic Factors", "South Africa", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072647964", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57189869193": {"Name": "Closson K.", "AuthorID": "57189869193", "AffiliationID": "60026960", "AffiliationName": "BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS"}, "57212258070": {"Name": "Smith T.", "AuthorID": "57212258070", "AffiliationID": "60018491", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser University"}, "6701840797": {"Name": "Brockman M.", "AuthorID": "6701840797", "AffiliationID": "60018491", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser University"}, "15048041200": {"Name": "Kaida A.", "AuthorID": "15048041200", "AffiliationID": "60018491", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser University"}, "35174230300": {"Name": "Dietrich J.J.", "AuthorID": "35174230300", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "Perinatal HIV Research Unit (PHRU), Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand"}, "56205695800": {"Name": "Hornschuh S.", "AuthorID": "56205695800", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "Perinatal HIV Research Unit (PHRU), Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand"}, "57203557626": {"Name": "Gray G.", "AuthorID": "57203557626", "AffiliationID": "60028973", "AffiliationName": "South African Medical Research Council"}, "6701588631": {"Name": "Beksinska M.", "AuthorID": "6701588631", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "Maternal Adolescent and Child Health (MatCH) Research Unit (MRU), Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand"}, "35601488200": {"Name": "Smit J.", "AuthorID": "35601488200", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "Maternal Adolescent and Child Health (MatCH) Research Unit (MRU), Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand"}, "24733933600": {"Name": "Gibbs A.", "AuthorID": "24733933600", "AffiliationID": "60028973", "AffiliationName": "South African Medical Research Council"}, "57204021682": {"Name": "Ndung\u2019u T.", "AuthorID": "57204021682", "AffiliationID": "60022344", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology"}}}
