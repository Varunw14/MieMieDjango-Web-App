Our objective was to find a genetic cause in a British family with a dominantly inherited autoinflammatory disease complicated by AA amyloidosis. Methods: The index patient and his sister underwent comprehensive clinical and laboratory assessment including the next-generation sequencing panel targeting autoinflammatory genes. Subsequently, other relatives underwent clinical evaluation and genetic testing. Screening of the SAA1 gene was performed in all symptomatic cases. Results: The index case and his sister presented with proteinuria due to AA amyloidosis. They have been suffering from episodes of fever accompanied by severe abdominal and chest pain, arthritis and erythema since childhood. Their father died aged 52 years from complications following a cadaveric renal transplantation. The post-mortem examination demonstrated AA amyloidosis. The index case's grandmother, two paternal cousins and two of their children described similar symptoms. All symptomatic individuals had excellent responses to colchicine. Next-generation sequencing analysis identified a single MEFV p.P373L variant in the index case, his sister and subsequently, in symptomatic family members. Sequencing of the SAA1 gene revealed all cases were heterozygous for the SAA1.1 allele. Conclusion: Typically FMF is an autosomal recessive disorder; nonetheless rare cases of dominantly inherited disease have previously been described. Here we report a novel MEFV variant p.P373L, causing dominant FMF complicated by AA amyloidosis in four generations of a British family.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AA amyloidosis", "colchicine", "familial Mediterranean fever (FMF)", "MEFV gene"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Amyloidosis", "Colchicine", "Familial Mediterranean Fever", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pedigree", "Pyrin", "Treatment Outcome", "Tubulin Modulators"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85080843213", "SubjectAreas": [["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"14012189400": {"Name": "Rowczenio D.M.", "AuthorID": "14012189400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London"}, "16481538400": {"Name": "Youngstein T.", "AuthorID": "16481538400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London"}, "55598248400": {"Name": "Trojer H.", "AuthorID": "55598248400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London"}, "55547947300": {"Name": "Baginska A.", "AuthorID": "55547947300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London"}, "55674746000": {"Name": "Papadopoulou C.", "AuthorID": "55674746000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London"}, "55985701600": {"Name": "Rezk T.", "AuthorID": "55985701600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London"}, "35464959200": {"Name": "Hawkins P.N.", "AuthorID": "35464959200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London"}, "7004915734": {"Name": "Lachmann H.J.", "AuthorID": "7004915734", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London"}, "55376853000": {"Name": "Omoyinmi E.", "AuthorID": "55376853000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health (ICH)"}, "7004602186": {"Name": "Brogan P.", "AuthorID": "7004602186", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health (ICH)"}}}
