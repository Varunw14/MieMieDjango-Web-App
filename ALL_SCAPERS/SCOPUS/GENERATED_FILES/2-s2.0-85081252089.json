It uses the popular and versatile Pandas library, and can be straightforwardly integrated into existing analysis code/pipelines. Seqfam can be used to verify pedigree information, to perform Monte Carlo gene dropping, to undertake regression-based gene burden testing, and to identify variants which segregate by affection status in families via user-defined pattern of occurrence rules. Additionally, it can generate scripts for running analyses in a \u2018MapReduce pattern\u2019 on a computer cluster, something which is usually desirable in NGS data analysis and indeed \u2018big data\u2019 analysis in general. This article summarises how seqfam\u2019s main user functions work and motivates their use. It also provides explanatory context for example scripts and data included in the package which demonstrate use cases. With respect to verifying pedigree information, software exists for efficiently calculating kinship coefficients, so seqfam performs the necessary extra steps of mapping pedigrees and kinship coefficients to expected and observed degrees of relationship respectively. Gene dropping and the application of variant pattern of occurrence rules in families can provide evidence for a variant being causal. The authors are unaware of other software which performs these tasks in familial cohorts, so seqfam fulfils this need. Gene burden rather than single marker tests are often used to detect rare causal variants due to greater power. Seqfam may be an attractive alternative to existing gene burden testing software due to its flexibility, particularly in grouping and aggregating variants.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bioinformatics", "DNA", "Gene-burden", "Gene-drop", "Kinship", "Mapreduce", "NGS", "Pedigree-information", "Python"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081252089", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)", "PHAR", "3000"]], "AuthorData": {"55224938800": {"Name": "Frampton M.", "AuthorID": "55224938800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Medicine, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "57191417575": {"Name": "Schiff E.R.", "AuthorID": "57191417575", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Medicine, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "57197868821": {"Name": "Segal A.W.", "AuthorID": "57197868821", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Medicine, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "37063339800": {"Name": "Levine A.P.", "AuthorID": "37063339800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Medicine, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "37665820900": {"Name": "Pontikos N.", "AuthorID": "37665820900", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital, University College London"}}}
