This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) License.This study aimed to compare the gap between gender role values and domestic practice in the UK and Spain. The data were drawn from a sample of British and Spanish male and female respondents to the International Social Survey Programme\u2019s (ISSP) \u2018Family and Changing Gender Roles\u2019 module (2002, 2012) and used to create multivariate models using ordinary least-squares regression techniques. The findings suggest that gender role values impacts domestic practice: more time is devoted to housework by egalitarian than non-egalitarian men and less by egalitarian than non-egalitarian women. That effect was not observed for care-giving, however. The impact of gender values on the division by sex of household chores was found to be similar in the UK and Spain. A gradual move to more egalitarian ideals was also observed in both countries over the 10 year period studied.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Care", "Comparative study", "Gender values", "Housework allocation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090519924", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"55547195200": {"Name": "Romero-Balsas P.", "AuthorID": "55547195200", "AffiliationID": "60026796", "AffiliationName": "Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid (UAM)"}, "57190298386": {"Name": "O\u2019Brien M.", "AuthorID": "57190298386", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL)"}, "57203976301": {"Name": "Bustamante C.C.", "AuthorID": "57203976301", "AffiliationID": "60027282", "AffiliationName": "Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM)"}}}
