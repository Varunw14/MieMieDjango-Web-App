We use importance sampling to approximate the Bellman operators defining the two functions. The random Bellman operators, and therefore also the corresponding solutions, are generally non-smooth which is undesirable. To circumvent this issue, we introduce smoothed versions of the random Bellman operators and solve for the corresponding smoothed value functions using sieve methods. We also show that one can avoid using sieves by generalizing and adapting the \u201cself-approximating\u201d method of Rust (1997b) to our setting. We provide an asymptotic theory for both approximate solution methods and show that they converge with N-rate, where N is number of Monte Carlo draws, towards Gaussian processes. We examine their performance in practice through a set of numerical experiments and find that both methods perform well with the sieve method being particularly attractive in terms of computational speed and accuracy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dynamic discrete choice", "Monte Carlo", "Numerical solution", "Sieves"], "IndexKeywords": ["Approximate solution", "Asymptotic theories", "Computational speed", "Corresponding solutions", "Discrete choice models", "Gaussian Processes", "Numerical experiments", "Value functions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094628639", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"22937960200": {"Name": "Kristensen D.", "AuthorID": "22937960200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University College London"}, "57219544778": {"Name": "Mogensen P.K.", "AuthorID": "57219544778", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University of Copenhagen"}, "24475083400": {"Name": "Schjerning B.", "AuthorID": "24475083400", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University of Copenhagen"}, "57219587186": {"Name": "Moon J.M.", "AuthorID": "57219587186", "AffiliationID": "106110342", "AffiliationName": "PIMCO"}}}
