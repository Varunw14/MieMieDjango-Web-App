Our objectives were to assess the feasibility, acceptability and impact of a novel intervention to reduce burnout and improve wellbeing. This is the first wellbeing intervention for medical doctors to include strategies for work-life boundary management and digital wellbeing. Methods: Twenty-two doctors participated in face-to-face workshops which included group discussion of challenges experienced and strategies to enhance self-care and wellbeing. A pre-post-test mixed-methods evaluation was undertaken. Questionnaire measures were the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory, Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale and the boundary control subscale of the Work-Life Indicator (i.e., the degree of perception of control of the boundaries between work and personal life). Paired t-tests examined whether there were statistically significant differences. Eleven doctors also participated in post-intervention semi-structured interviews. Transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: The intervention was well-received, with all trainees finding the workshop useful and saying they would recommend it to others. At baseline most participants had scores indicative of burnout on both the disengagement (82%) and exhaustion (82%) subscales of the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory. One month post-intervention, participants had a statistically significant reduction in burnout (both disengagement and exhaustion) and improvement in boundary control. Wellbeing scores also improved, but differences were not statistically significant. Qualitative analysis indicated participants had welcomed a safe space to discuss stressors and many had implemented digital wellbeing strategies to manage their smartphone technology, and increased self-care such as mindfulness practice and walking in green space. Conclusions: The intervention reduced burnout and improved boundary control. We suggest that having protected time for doctors to share personal experiences, adopt digital wellbeing and self-care strategies are effective tools to support doctors\u2019 wellbeing and should be investigated further.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Boundary control", "Burnout", "Digital technologies", "Doctors-in-training", "Intervention", "Wellbeing"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090820769", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"57192165072": {"Name": "Rich A.", "AuthorID": "57192165072", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Medical Education, UCL Medical School, University College London"}, "57218932560": {"Name": "Aly A.", "AuthorID": "57218932560", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Medical Education, UCL Medical School, University College London"}, "57200130456": {"Name": "Baker M.", "AuthorID": "57200130456", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Medical Education, UCL Medical School, University College London"}, "57002953700": {"Name": "Viney R.", "AuthorID": "57002953700", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Medical Education, UCL Medical School, University College London"}, "55851220100": {"Name": "Cecchinato M.E.", "AuthorID": "55851220100", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Computer and Information Sciences Department, Northumbria University"}, "57209397994": {"Name": "Lascau L.", "AuthorID": "57209397994", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College London"}, "23391770800": {"Name": "Cox A.L.", "AuthorID": "23391770800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College London"}}}
