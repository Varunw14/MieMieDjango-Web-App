These aim to resolve the deficiencies of on-site manual manipulation of hand-held ultrasound probes. This paper presents the recent ongoing developments of a series of bespoke robotic systems, including both single-arm and dual-arm versions, for a project known as intelligent Fetal Imaging and Diagnosis (iFIND). After a brief review of the development history of the extracorporeal ultrasound robotic system used for fetal and abdominal examinations, the specific aim of the iFIND robots, the design evolution, the implementation details of each version, and the initial clinical feedback of the iFIND robot series are presented. Based on the preliminary testing of these newly-proposed robots on 42 volunteers, the successful and reliable working of the mechatronic systems were validated. Analysis of a participant questionnaire indicates a comfortable scanning experience for the volunteers and a good acceptance rate to being scanned by the robots.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acceptance rate", "Design evolution", "Development history", "Mechatronic systems", "Robotic systems", "Technical aspects", "Ultrasound probes", "Ultrasound system"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073894511", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57190987771": {"Name": "Wang S.", "AuthorID": "57190987771", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "57204179926": {"Name": "Housden J.", "AuthorID": "57204179926", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "56637802700": {"Name": "Noh Y.", "AuthorID": "56637802700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "57211431121": {"Name": "Tan C.", "AuthorID": "57211431121", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "55429442800": {"Name": "Gomez A.", "AuthorID": "55429442800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "35747505200": {"Name": "Toussaint N.", "AuthorID": "35747505200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "55865061600": {"Name": "Zimmer V.", "AuthorID": "55865061600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "57205933336": {"Name": "Hajnal J.", "AuthorID": "57205933336", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "57197702550": {"Name": "Razavi R.", "AuthorID": "57197702550", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "9245867600": {"Name": "Rhode K.", "AuthorID": "9245867600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "57209912238": {"Name": "Singh D.", "AuthorID": "57209912238", "AffiliationID": "60170137", "AffiliationName": "Xtronics Ltd."}, "57205465825": {"Name": "Singh A.", "AuthorID": "57205465825", "AffiliationID": "60170137", "AffiliationName": "Xtronics Ltd."}, "56035771700": {"Name": "Skelton E.", "AuthorID": "56035771700", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Women's Ultrasound Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57192071101": {"Name": "Matthew J.", "AuthorID": "57192071101", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Women's Ultrasound Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57194856597": {"Name": "Fletcher T.", "AuthorID": "57194856597", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Women's Ultrasound Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56496402200": {"Name": "Back J.", "AuthorID": "56496402200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, King's College London"}, "56741222700": {"Name": "Lindenroth L.", "AuthorID": "56741222700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, King's College London"}, "55719408400": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "55719408400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, King's College London"}, "55750027100": {"Name": "Knight C.", "AuthorID": "55750027100", "AffiliationID": "60109217, 60005518", "AffiliationName": "Division of Women's Health, Fetal Medicine Unit, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, Women's Health Academic Centre, King's Health Partners"}, "24315243700": {"Name": "Pasupathy D.", "AuthorID": "24315243700", "AffiliationID": "60109217, 60005518", "AffiliationName": "Division of Women's Health, Fetal Medicine Unit, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, Women's Health Academic Centre, King's Health Partners"}, "57191544056": {"Name": "Lloyd D.", "AuthorID": "57191544056", "AffiliationID": "60107269", "AffiliationName": "Fetal Cardiology, Evelina Children's Hospital"}, "7404325466": {"Name": "Simpson J.", "AuthorID": "7404325466", "AffiliationID": "60107269", "AffiliationName": "Fetal Cardiology, Evelina Children's Hospital"}, "6701489118": {"Name": "Althoefer K.", "AuthorID": "6701489118", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Science and Engineering, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
