The trials aimed to evaluate the efficacy of daily subcutaneous concizumab prophylaxis (evaluated as annualized bleeding rate [ABR] at last dose level), with secondary objectives being safety and immunogenicity (assessed as number of adverse events [AEs] and antidrug antibodies [ADAs]). Patients received 0.15 mg/kg concizumab, with potential dose escalation to 0.20 and 0.25 mg/kg (if \u20213 spontaneous bleeding episodes within 12 weeks of concizumab treatment). Relevant pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) parameters were assessed. Thirty-six HA, 9 HAwI, and 8 HBwI patients were exposed to concizumab. Most inhibitor patients (15 of 17; 88.2%) did not escalate the dose; all patients chose to continue to the extension phase of the trials. Clinical proof of concept for prevention of bleeding episodes was demonstrated in both trials. Estimated ABRs in HAwI and HBwI were lower vs HA: 3.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7; 5.3) and 5.9 (95% CI, 4.2; 8.5) vs 7.0 (95% CI, 4.6; 10.7), respectively. PK/PD results were as expected, with no difference between hemophilia subtypes for concizumab exposure, free tissue factor pathway inhibitor, thrombin generation, prothrombin fragment 112, and D-dimers. Concizumab was safe and well tolerated (no severe AEs, AE-related withdrawals, or thromboembolic events). Three patients had (very low to medium titer) ADA1 tests in each trial, with no observed clinical effect. These results support further development of concizumab as a daily prophylactic treatment in all hemophilia patients.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized", "Blood Coagulation Factor Inhibitors", "Female", "Hemophilia A", "Hemophilia B", "Hemorrhage", "Humans", "Injections, Subcutaneous", "Male", "Middle Aged"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074346534", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"56079165500": {"Name": "Shapiro A.D.", "AuthorID": "56079165500", "AffiliationID": "100322773", "AffiliationName": "Indiana Hemophilia and Thrombosis Center"}, "6602706106": {"Name": "Angchaisuksiri P.", "AuthorID": "6602706106", "AffiliationID": "60015887, 60012718", "AffiliationName": "Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University"}, "7004176306": {"Name": "Astermark J.", "AuthorID": "7004176306", "AffiliationID": "60029170, 60014077", "AffiliationName": "Center for Thrombosis and Haemostasis, Lund University, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital"}, "12779379600": {"Name": "Benson G.", "AuthorID": "12779379600", "AffiliationID": "60030456", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hematology, Belfast Health and Social Care Trust"}, "7005594597": {"Name": "Castaman G.", "AuthorID": "7005594597", "AffiliationID": "60021921", "AffiliationName": "Center for Bleeding Disorders and Coagulation, Department of Oncology, Careggi University Hospital"}, "57193134405": {"Name": "Chowdary P.", "AuthorID": "57193134405", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Katharine Dormandy Hemophilia Centre and Thrombosis Unit, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55611724500": {"Name": "Eichler H.", "AuthorID": "55611724500", "AffiliationID": "60023686", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Hemostaseology and Transfusion Medicine, Saarland University and University Hospital"}, "24437049200": {"Name": "Jim\u00e9nez-Yuste V.", "AuthorID": "24437049200", "AffiliationID": "60028162, 60026796", "AffiliationName": "Haematology Department, La Paz University Hospital, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma Madrid"}, "35885183600": {"Name": "Kavakli K.", "AuthorID": "35885183600", "AffiliationID": "60022028", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hematology, Ege University Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "7402306083": {"Name": "Matsushita T.", "AuthorID": "7402306083", "AffiliationID": "60024818", "AffiliationName": "Department of Transfusion Medicine, Nagoya University Hospital"}, "19435622000": {"Name": "Poulsen L.H.", "AuthorID": "19435622000", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Hemophilia Centre, Department of Haematology, Aarhus University"}, "57189994725": {"Name": "Wheeler A.P.", "AuthorID": "57189994725", "AffiliationID": "60030769", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "7402899904": {"Name": "Young G.", "AuthorID": "7402899904", "AffiliationID": "60015183, 60020565, 60029311", "AffiliationName": "Hemostasis and Thrombosis Center, Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California"}, "6602658452": {"Name": "Zupancic-Salek S.", "AuthorID": "6602658452", "AffiliationID": "60006461, 60008408", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, University of Zagreb"}, "7005152976": {"Name": "Oldenburg J.", "AuthorID": "7005152976", "AffiliationID": "60030465", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Hemostasis, Institute of Experimental Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, University Clinic"}}}
