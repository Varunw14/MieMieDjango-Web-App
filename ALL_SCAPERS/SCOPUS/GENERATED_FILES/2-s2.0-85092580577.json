The Authors.We calculate the magnetospheric drag torques on Saturn's northern and southern polar thermospheres during late southern summer in 2008 and northern spring in 2012\u20132013 using previously derived profiles of ionospheric meridional coupling currents determined from high-latitude Cassini magnetic field data. We show that the drag torques in the \u201cwinter\u201d and \u201csummer\u201d auroral regions are near equal at ~2.3 \u00d7 1016 N m, contrary to the recent discussion of Brooks et al. (2019, https://doi.org/10.1002/2019JA026870) who suggest that significant seasonal differences should occur in these regions. Instead, seasonally dependent torques occur in the adjacent polar open field regions, where the \u201cwinter\u201d and \u201csummer\u201d torques are ~0.3 \u00d7 1016 and ~1.8 \u00d7 1016 N m, respectively. We derive a simple rotating disc model of the polar thermosphere and estimate the speed of the poleward flow from midlatitudes required to balance these torques in steady state, finding values of tens of m s\u22121 consistent with previous numerical modeling. Comparison of the calculated torques with concurrent periods of the northern and southern planetary period oscillations (PPOs) does not suggest a direct connection between these quantities as proposed by Brooks et al., 2019, showing at the least that significant additional factors must be involved. We further note some issues with their scenario for dual modulation of radio emissions, previous observations having shown that the principal oscillatory PPO field-aligned currents that modulate the emissions rotate in the auroral region with periods ~10.7 \u00b1 0.1 hr, propagating through the more slowly rotating ~15\u201320 hr period outer magnetospheric plasma, with implications for the proposed \u201catmospheric flywheel\u201d picture.", "AuthorKeywords": ["auroral region", "ionosphere", "magnetosphere", "planetary period oscillations", "Saturn"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092580577", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Forestry", "AGRI", "1107"], ["Oceanography", "EART", "1910"], ["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"], ["Soil Science", "AGRI", "1111"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"], ["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"], ["Paleontology", "EART", "1911"]], "AuthorData": {"57205960565": {"Name": "Cowley S.W.H.", "AuthorID": "57205960565", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester"}, "57193190424": {"Name": "Bradley T.J.", "AuthorID": "57193190424", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester"}, "7006249139": {"Name": "Provan G.", "AuthorID": "7006249139", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester"}, "6602683160": {"Name": "Bunce E.J.", "AuthorID": "6602683160", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester"}, "6602674743": {"Name": "Achilleos N.", "AuthorID": "6602674743", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56465420300": {"Name": "Hunt G.J.", "AuthorID": "56465420300", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Blackett Laboratory, Imperial College London"}}}
