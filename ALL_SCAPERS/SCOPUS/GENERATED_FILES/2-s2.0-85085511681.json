This result is consistent with subsequent data generated in chimeric mouse-human livers showing that the AAV2 capsid transduces primary human hepatocytes in vivo with low efficiency. In contrast, novel variants generated by directed evolution in the same model, such as AAV-NP59, transduce primary human hepatocytes with high efficiency. While these empirical data have immense translational implications, the mechanisms underpinning this enhanced AAV capsid transduction performance in primary human hepatocytes are yet to be fully elucidated. Remarkably, AAV-NP59 differs from the prototypical AAV2 capsid by only 11 aa and can serve as a tool to study the correlation between capsid sequence/structure and vector function. Using two orthogonal vectorological approaches, we have determined that just 2 of the 11 changes present in AAV-NP59 (T503A and N596D) account for the enhanced transduction performance of this capsid variant in primary human hepatocytes in vivo, an effect that we have associated with attenuation of heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) binding affinity. In support of this hypothesis, we have identified, using directed evolution, two additional single amino acid substitution AAV2 variants, N496D and N582S, which are highly functional in vivo. Both substitution mutations reduce AAV2\u2019s affinity for HSPG. Finally, we have modulated the ability of AAV8, a highly murine-hepatotropic serotype, to interact with HSPG. The results support our hypothesis that enhanced HSPG binding can negatively affect the in vivo function of otherwise strongly hepatotropic variants and that modulation of the interaction with HSPG is critical to ensure maximum efficiency in vivo. The insights gained through this study can have powerful implications for studies into AAV biology and capsid development for preclinical and clinical applications targeting liver and other organs. Adeno-associated viral vectors based on serotype 2 transduce primary human hepatocytes in a xenograft model of human liver with low efficiency. Lisowski and colleagues demonstrated that attenuation of the interaction of AAV2 with its primary receptor, heparan sulfate proteoglycan, significantly enhances transduction of human hepatocytes in this preclinical model.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085511681", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"57195225527": {"Name": "Cabanes-Creus M.", "AuthorID": "57195225527", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60016007", "AffiliationName": "Translational Vectorology Research Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, The University of Sydney"}, "56912446600": {"Name": "Westhaus A.", "AuthorID": "56912446600", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57216803976": {"Name": "Navarro R.G.", "AuthorID": "57216803976", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60016007", "AffiliationName": "Translational Vectorology Research Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, The University of Sydney"}, "57216803770": {"Name": "Baltazar G.", "AuthorID": "57216803770", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60016007", "AffiliationName": "Translational Vectorology Research Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, The University of Sydney"}, "23767680900": {"Name": "Zhu E.", "AuthorID": "23767680900", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60016007, 60026571", "AffiliationName": "Gene Therapy Research Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute & The Children's Hospital at Westmead, University of Sydney"}, "36340034100": {"Name": "Liao S.H.Y.", "AuthorID": "36340034100", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60016007", "AffiliationName": "Translational Vectorology Research Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, The University of Sydney"}, "57216221170": {"Name": "Sallard E.", "AuthorID": "57216221170", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60016007", "AffiliationName": "Translational Vectorology Research Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, The University of Sydney"}, "57204856551": {"Name": "Dilworth K.L.", "AuthorID": "57204856551", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60016007", "AffiliationName": "Translational Vectorology Research Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, The University of Sydney"}, "55680878000": {"Name": "Rybicki A.", "AuthorID": "55680878000", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60016007", "AffiliationName": "Translational Vectorology Research Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, The University of Sydney"}, "57193560662": {"Name": "Drouyer M.", "AuthorID": "57193560662", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60016007", "AffiliationName": "Translational Vectorology Research Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, The University of Sydney"}, "57208461286": {"Name": "Lisowski L.", "AuthorID": "57208461286", "AffiliationID": "60085463", "AffiliationName": "Military Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, Biological Threats Identification and Countermeasure Center"}, "55907715700": {"Name": "Santilli G.", "AuthorID": "55907715700", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7005085037": {"Name": "Thrasher A.J.", "AuthorID": "7005085037", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57195233474": {"Name": "Amaya A.K.", "AuthorID": "57195233474", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60016007, 60026571", "AffiliationName": "Gene Therapy Research Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute & The Children's Hospital at Westmead, University of Sydney"}, "57212388839": {"Name": "Scott S.", "AuthorID": "57212388839", "AffiliationID": "60029470", "AffiliationName": "Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)"}, "8970366300": {"Name": "Hallwirth C.V.", "AuthorID": "8970366300", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60016007, 60026571", "AffiliationName": "Gene Therapy Research Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute & The Children's Hospital at Westmead, University of Sydney"}, "7103382748": {"Name": "Alexander I.E.", "AuthorID": "7103382748", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Discipline of Child and Adolescent Health, The University of Sydney"}, "23059362100": {"Name": "Bennett A.", "AuthorID": "23059362100", "AffiliationID": "60013959", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Center for Structural Biology, University of Florida"}, "57220384915": {"Name": "Agbandje-McKenna M.", "AuthorID": "57220384915", "AffiliationID": "60013959", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Center for Structural Biology, University of Florida"}}}
