Focal treatment reduces this risk while offering a second opportunity for cure. We report updated outcomes of ultrafocal salvage high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT). Methods and Materials: Prospectively collected data from the first 50 treated patients were analyzed. Disease status was assessed by 3T multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 18F-Choline or 68Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computed tomography, and systematic or tumor-targeted biopsies. Ultrafocal salvage HDR-BT (1 \u00d7 19 Gy) was performed by implanting the clinical target volume (CTV: gross tumor volume + 5 mm margin) under fused transrectal ultrasound/MRI guidance. Follow-up included toxicity grading (using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 4.0), quality of life assessment, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing. Results: Median follow-up was 31 months. Median CTV D95% was 18.8 Gy. We observed 2% grade 3 genitourinary toxicity, no grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity, and 22% newly developed grade 3 erectile dysfunction. Five of 13 patients (38%) with self-reported pretreatment potency (International Index of Erectile Function >17) remained potent. Clinically relevant quality of life deterioration was reported for only 6 of 31 items and was not statistically significant. Biochemical failure (nadir + 2) occurred in 26 patients. Among intraprostatic recurrences, 73% were in field. After 2.5 years, biochemical disease-free survival was 51% (95% confidence interval, 37%-69%), metastases-free survival was 75% (64%-89%), androgen deprivation therapy\u2013free survival was 90% (82%-99%), and overall survival was 98% (94%-100%). Presalvage PSA, CTV size, and stage \u2265T3 were significantly associated with biochemical failure. Higher-risk patients (stage \u2265T3, PSA \u226510, or PSA double time \u22649 months) had 25% biochemical disease-free survival at 2.5 years versus 71% for lower-risk patients. Conclusions: At this early stage, MRI-guided ultrafocal HDR-BT seems to be a safe salvage treatment option, with acceptable biochemical control in a well-selected group of patients and potential for effectively postponing androgen deprivation therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Androgen deprivation therapy", "Common terminology criteria", "Gastrointestinal toxicities", "High-dose-rate brachytherapy", "Metastases-free survivals", "Positron emission tomography/computed tomographies", "Prostate specific antigen", "Prostate-specific membrane antigens", "Aged", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Grading", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "Quality of Life", "Radiation Dosage", "Radiotherapy Dosage", "Radiotherapy, Image-Guided", "Recurrence", "Risk", "Safety", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079899452", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"57203945828": {"Name": "van Son M.J.", "AuthorID": "57203945828", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiotherapy, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "55334701600": {"Name": "Peters M.", "AuthorID": "55334701600", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiotherapy, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "6603676425": {"Name": "Moerland M.A.", "AuthorID": "6603676425", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiotherapy, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "7007117582": {"Name": "Lagendijk J.J.W.", "AuthorID": "7007117582", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiotherapy, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "36135494300": {"Name": "Eppinga W.S.C.", "AuthorID": "36135494300", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiotherapy, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "8974308500": {"Name": "van der Voort van Zyp J.R.N.", "AuthorID": "8974308500", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiotherapy, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "57114379700": {"Name": "Shah T.T.", "AuthorID": "57114379700", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60012558", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Charing Cross Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "8147855500": {"Name": "Ahmed H.U.", "AuthorID": "8147855500", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60012558", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Charing Cross Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}}}
