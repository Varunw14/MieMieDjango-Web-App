Here, Sm0.75A0.25MnxCo1-xO2.88 (A = Ca, or Sr) is investigated as a potential new cathode material to substitute the traditional lanthanum-strontium manganate for intermediate temperature SOFCs. Using a combination of density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamics simulations, the crucial parameters for SOFC performance, such as the electronic structure, electronic and ionic conductivity, and thermal expansion coefficient, were evaluated. An evaluation of the results illustrates that the conductivity and thermal match of the materials with the electrolyte is dramatically improved with respect to the existing state-of-the-art.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Crucial parameters", "Electronic and ionic conductivity", "Intermediate temperatures", "Lanthanum strontium manganates", "Molecular dynamics simulations", "New cathode material", "State of the art", "Thermal expansion coefficients"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077403316", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57190303700": {"Name": "Olsson E.", "AuthorID": "57190303700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57193753001": {"Name": "Aparicio-Angl\u00e8s X.", "AuthorID": "57193753001", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "54790560500": {"Name": "De Leeuw N.H.", "AuthorID": "54790560500", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff University, Main Building"}, "57189512233": {"Name": "Cottom J.", "AuthorID": "57189512233", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
