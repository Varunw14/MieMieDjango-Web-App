All rights reserved.Background Artificial intelligence (AI) research in colonoscopy is progressing rapidly but widespread clinical implementation is not yet a reality. We aimed to identify the top implementation research priorities. Methods An established modified Delphi approach for research priority setting was used. Fifteen international experts, including endoscopists and translational computer scientists/engineers, from nine countries participated in an online survey over 9 months. Questions related to AI implementation in colonoscopy were generated as a long-list in the first round, and then scored in two subsequent rounds to identify the top 10 research questions. Results The top 10 ranked questions were categorized into five themes. Theme 1: clinical trial design/end points (4 questions), related to optimum trial designs for polyp detection and characterization, determining the optimal end points for evaluation of AI, and demonstrating impact on interval cancer rates. Theme 2: technological developments (3 questions), including improving detection of more challenging and advanced lesions, reduction of false-positive rates, and minimizing latency. Theme 3: clinical adoption/integration (1 question), concerning the effective combination of detection and characterization into one workflow. Theme 4: data access/annotation (1 question), concerning more efficient or automated data annotation methods to reduce the burden on human experts. Theme 5: regulatory approval (1 question), related to making regulatory approval processes more efficient. Conclusions This is the first reported international research priority setting exercise for AI in colonoscopy. The study findings should be used as a framework to guide future research with key stakeholders to accelerate the clinical implementation of AI in endoscopy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85099584066", "SubjectAreas": [["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"57194317365": {"Name": "Ahmad O.F.", "AuthorID": "57194317365", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences, University College London"}, "57217833493": {"Name": "Stoyanov D.", "AuthorID": "57217833493", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences, University College London"}, "57203948405": {"Name": "Lovat L.B.", "AuthorID": "57203948405", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Gastrointestinal Services, University College London Hospital"}, "54392344400": {"Name": "Mori Y.", "AuthorID": "54392344400", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Effectiveness Research Group, Institute of Health and Society, University of Oslo"}, "36632805600": {"Name": "Misawa M.", "AuthorID": "36632805600", "AffiliationID": "60159849", "AffiliationName": "Digestive Disease Center, Showa University Northern Yokohama Hospital"}, "7202763165": {"Name": "Kudo S.E.", "AuthorID": "7202763165", "AffiliationID": "60159849", "AffiliationName": "Digestive Disease Center, Showa University Northern Yokohama Hospital"}, "56137363700": {"Name": "Anderson J.T.", "AuthorID": "56137363700", "AffiliationID": "60021179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "42261157100": {"Name": "Bernal J.", "AuthorID": "42261157100", "AffiliationID": "60023020, 60104040", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science Department, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Computer Vision Center"}, "35760130200": {"Name": "Berzin T.M.", "AuthorID": "35760130200", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60030058", "AffiliationName": "Center for Advanced Endoscopy, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School"}, "6701827503": {"Name": "Bisschops R.", "AuthorID": "6701827503", "AffiliationID": "60031069, 60025063, 60121260", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University Hospitals Leuven, TARGID KU Leuven"}, "7202358618": {"Name": "Byrne M.F.", "AuthorID": "7202358618", "AffiliationID": "60010365, 60027009", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology, Vancouver General Hospital, University of British Columbia"}, "57116757500": {"Name": "Chen P.J.", "AuthorID": "57116757500", "AffiliationID": "60011828, 60004965", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center"}, "14323287300": {"Name": "East J.E.", "AuthorID": "14323287300", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60172675", "AffiliationName": "Oxford NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, University of Oxford"}, "57212009491": {"Name": "Eelbode T.", "AuthorID": "57212009491", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Medical Imaging Research Center, ESAT/PSI, KU Leuven"}, "7005533698": {"Name": "Elson D.S.", "AuthorID": "7005533698", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}, "6506671818": {"Name": "Gurudu S.R.", "AuthorID": "6506671818", "AffiliationID": "60026952", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic"}, "6507053505": {"Name": "Histace A.", "AuthorID": "6507053505", "AffiliationID": "60002272, 60008134, 60070482", "AffiliationName": "ETIS, Universite de Cergy-Pointoise, ENSEA, CNRS"}, "7004068848": {"Name": "Karnes W.E.", "AuthorID": "7004068848", "AffiliationID": "60007278", "AffiliationName": "H.
