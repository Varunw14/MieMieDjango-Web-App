Methods: Between April and May 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional, electronic survey on remote systems use before and during the COVID-19 pandemic through the European reference center for rare and complex epilepsies (EpiCARE) network, the International and the French Leagues Against Epilepsy, and the International and the French Child Neurology Associations. After descriptive statistical analysis, we compared the results of France, China, and Italy. Results: One hundred and seventy-two respondents from 35 countries completed the survey. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, 63.4% had experienced remote systems for clinical care. During the pandemic, the use of remote clinics, either institutional or personal, significantly increased (p < 10\u22124). Eighty-three percent used remote systems with video, either institutional (75%) or personal (25%). During the pandemic, 84.6% of respondents involved in academic activities transformed their courses to online teaching. From February to July 2020, few scientific meetings relevant to epileptologists and routinely attended was adapted to virtual meeting (median: 1 [25th\u201375th percentile: 0\u20132]). Responders were quite satisfied with remote systems in all three activity domains. Interestingly, before the COVID-19 pandemic, remote systems were significantly more frequently used in China for clinical activity compared with France or Italy. This difference became less marked during the pandemic. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically altered how academic epileptologists carry out their core missions of clinical care, medical education, and scientific discovery and dissemination. Close attention to the impact of these changes is merited.", "AuthorKeywords": ["E-health", "E-learning", "Remote work system", "Teleconsultations", "Telemedicine", "Virtual meeting"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Africa", "Aged", "Asia", "Attitude of Health Personnel", "Betacoronavirus", "China", "Computer Security", "Confidentiality", "Coronavirus Infections", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Education, Distance", "Epilepsy", "Europe", "Female", "France", "Humans", "Italy", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neurologists", "Neurology", "North America", "Pandemics", "Pneumonia, Viral", "Practice Patterns, Physicians'", "Remote Consultation", "South America", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Telemedicine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090013684", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"55776110500": {"Name": "Kuchenbuch M.", "AuthorID": "55776110500", "AffiliationID": "60123804, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Translational Research for Neurological Disorders, INSERM UMR 1163, Imagine institute, Universit\u00e9 de Paris"}, "57217380606": {"Name": "d'Onofrio G.", "AuthorID": "57217380606", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Residency Program, Department of Women and Child Health, University of Padua"}, "6701756441": {"Name": "Nabbout R.", "AuthorID": "6701756441", "AffiliationID": "60123804, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Translational Research for Neurological Disorders, INSERM UMR 1163, Imagine institute, Universit\u00e9 de Paris"}, "6603731456": {"Name": "Wirrell E.", "AuthorID": "6603731456", "AffiliationID": "60005558", "AffiliationName": "Divisions of Child and Adolescent Neurology and Epilepsy, Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic"}, "7404833361": {"Name": "Jiang Y.", "AuthorID": "7404833361", "AffiliationID": "107063808", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Pediatrics and Pediatric Epilepsy Center, Peking, University First Hospital"}, "56519409700": {"Name": "Dupont S.", "AuthorID": "56519409700", "AffiliationID": "60001422", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Paris Sorbonne"}, "36967058100": {"Name": "Grinspan Z.M.", "AuthorID": "36967058100", "AffiliationID": "60007997", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Population Health Sciences and Pediatrics, Weill Cornell Medicine"}, "15135263800": {"Name": "Auvin S.", "AuthorID": "15135263800", "AffiliationID": "60011675, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "APHP, Department of Pediatric Neurology, H\u00f4pital Robert-Debr\u00e9"}, "7004360200": {"Name": "Wilmshurst J.M.", "AuthorID": "7004360200", "AffiliationID": "60000356, 60013264", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Neurology Department, Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital, Neuroscience Institute, University of Cape Town"}, "7003564550": {"Name": "Arzimanoglou A.", "AuthorID": "7003564550", "AffiliationID": "60001576", "AffiliationName": "Epilepsy Unit, San Juan de Dios Children's Hospital, Universitat de Barcelona, Member of the ERN EpiCARE"}, "9250118200": {"Name": "Cross J.H.", "AuthorID": "9250118200", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL NIHR BRC Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "6603496267": {"Name": "Specchio N.", "AuthorID": "6603496267", "AffiliationID": "60017905", "AffiliationName": "Rare and Complex Epilepsy Unit, Department of Neuroscience, Bambino Gesu\u2019 Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Member of European Reference Network EpiCARE"}}}
