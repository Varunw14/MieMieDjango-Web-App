When the number of relay antennas M becomes very large and tends to be infinite, we study the large-scale approximation of the sum spectral efficiency (SE) with the effect of spatial correlation generated by the constrained space. Furthermore, we investigate the energy efficiency (EE) with a practical power consumption model, and demonstrate the impact of the relay antenna number and the size of constrained space on the EE performance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Decode-and-forward relaying", "massive MIMO", "spatial correlation", "spectral efficiency and energy efficiency", "zero forcing processing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Constrained space", "Decode and forward", "Decode-and-forward relaying", "Half-duplex relay", "Power consumption model", "Spatial correlations", "Spectral efficiencies", "Zero-forcing"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075857378", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57202600201": {"Name": "Qian J.", "AuthorID": "57202600201", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}, "23009493900": {"Name": "Masouros C.", "AuthorID": "23009493900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}}}
