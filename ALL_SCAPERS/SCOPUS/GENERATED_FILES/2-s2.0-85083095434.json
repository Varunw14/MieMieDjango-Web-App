Current risk scores are mostly derived from clinical trials with stringent patient selection. We aimed to establish and evaluate a composite scoring system to improve short-term mortality classification after index episodes of AMI, independent of electrocardiography (ECG) pattern, in a large real-world cohort. Methods: Using electronic health records, patients admitted to our regional teaching hospital (derivation cohort, n = 1747) and an independent tertiary care center (validation cohort, n = 1276), with index acute myocardial infarction between January 2013 and December 2017, as confirmed by principal diagnosis and laboratory findings, were identified retrospectively. Results: Univariate logistic regression was used as the primary model to identify potential contributors to mortality. Stepwise forward likelihood ratio logistic regression revealed that neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, peripheral vascular disease, age, and serum creatinine (NPAC) were significant for 90-day mortality (Hosmer- Lemeshow test, p = 0.21). Each component of the NPAC score was weighted by beta-coefficients in multivariate analysis. The C-statistic of the NPAC score was 0.75, which was higher than the conventional Charlson's score (C-statistic = 0.63). Judicious application of a deep learning model to our dataset improved the accuracy of classification with a C-statistic of 0.81. Conclusions: The NPAC score comprises four items from routine laboratory parameters to basic clinical information and can facilitate early identification of cases at risk of short-term mortality following index myocardial infarction. Deep learning model can serve as a gatekeeper to facilitate clinical decision-making.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardiovascular", "Heart disease", "Mortality", "Myocardial infarction", "Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083095434", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57216322206": {"Name": "Li C.K.", "AuthorID": "57216322206", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "56754283200": {"Name": "Ho J.", "AuthorID": "56754283200", "AffiliationID": "60002798", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, Li Ka Shing Institute of Health Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"}, "57210469337": {"Name": "Liu Y.Z.", "AuthorID": "57210469337", "AffiliationID": "60002798", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, Li Ka Shing Institute of Health Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"}, "56049927100": {"Name": "Chan M.T.", "AuthorID": "56049927100", "AffiliationID": "60002798", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, Li Ka Shing Institute of Health Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"}, "35243901900": {"Name": "Zhang L.", "AuthorID": "35243901900", "AffiliationID": "60002798", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Digestive Disease, Institute of Digestive Disease, Li Ka Shing Institute of Health Sciences, And Shenzhen Research Institute, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"}, "57220380914": {"Name": "Gin T.", "AuthorID": "57220380914", "AffiliationID": "60002798", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, Li Ka Shing Institute of Health Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"}, "18345422600": {"Name": "Wu W.K.K.", "AuthorID": "18345422600", "AffiliationID": "60002798", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Digestive Disease, Institute of Digestive Disease, Li Ka Shing Institute of Health Sciences, And Shenzhen Research Institute, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"}, "57200531287": {"Name": "Lakhani I.", "AuthorID": "57200531287", "AffiliationID": "110855795", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Cardiovascular Physiology, Li Ka Shing Institute of Health Sciences"}, "57205252749": {"Name": "Bazoukis G.", "AuthorID": "57205252749", "AffiliationID": "60064532", "AffiliationName": "Second Department of Cardiology, Laboratory of Cardiac Electrophysiology, Evangelismos General Hospital of Athens"}, "23568158200": {"Name": "Liu T.", "AuthorID": "23568158200", "AffiliationID": "60121926", "AffiliationName": "Tianjin Key Laboratory of Ionic-Molecular Function of Cardiovascular Disease, Tianjin Institute of Cardiology, Department of Cardiology, Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University"}, "56829029100": {"Name": "Tse G.", "AuthorID": "56829029100", "AffiliationID": "60002798", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"}, "56423885000": {"Name": "Wong W.T.", "AuthorID": "56423885000", "AffiliationID": "60002798", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"}, "7404684691": {"Name": "Cheng S.H.", "AuthorID": "7404684691", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine and Life Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "7403907890": {"Name": "Wong M.C.", "AuthorID": "7403907890", "AffiliationID": "60002798", "AffiliationName": "The Jockey Club School of Public Health and Primary Care, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"}, "7102513915": {"Name": "Wong I.C.K.", "AuthorID": "7102513915", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57216277754": {"Name": "Xu Z.", "AuthorID": "57216277754", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "School of Data Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "36448087800": {"Name": "Zhang Q.", "AuthorID": "36448087800", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "School of Data Science, City University of Hong Kong"}}}
