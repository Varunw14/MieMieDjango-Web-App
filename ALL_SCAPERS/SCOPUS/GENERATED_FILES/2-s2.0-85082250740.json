By unpacking mundane food occasions - from school dinners to domestic meals and from breakfast to snacks - Feeding Children Inside and Outside the Home shows the role of food in the everyday lives of children and adults around them. Investigating food occasions at home, schools and in nurseries during weekdays and holidays, this book reveals how children, mothers, fathers, teachers and other adults involved in feeding children, understand, make sense of and navigate ideological discourses of parenting, health imperatives and policy interventions. Revealing the material and symbolic complexity of feeding children, and the role that parenting and healthy discourses play in shaping, perpetuating and transforming both feeding and eating, this volume shows how micro and macro aspects are at play in mundane and everyday practices of family life and education. This volume will be of great interested to a wide range of students and researchers interested in the sociology of family life, education, food studies and everyday consumption.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082250740", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"15519589600": {"Name": "Harman V.", "AuthorID": "15519589600", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "University of Surrey"}, "54879988100": {"Name": "Cappellini B.", "AuthorID": "54879988100", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Royal Holloway, University of London"}, "36157708400": {"Name": "Faircloth C.", "AuthorID": "36157708400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
