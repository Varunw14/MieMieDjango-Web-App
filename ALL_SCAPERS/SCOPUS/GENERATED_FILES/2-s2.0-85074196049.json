Here, we report a molybdenum dioxide (MoOx)-based system for synergistic chemo- and photothermal therapy of cancer. MoOx nanosheets were generated via a one-step hydrothermal route, grafted with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), and decorated with melanin (Mel), with successful functionalization confirmed by IR spectroscopy. The mean diameter and thickness of the MoOx particles were found to be 302 \u00b1 34 nm and 19 \u00b1 2 nm using atomic force microscopy. The hydrodynamic size of the MoOx nanosheets was 105 \u00b1 17 nm, and the resulting final MoOx-PEG-Mel-DOX nanocomposite formulation had a uniform diameter of 161 \u00b1 26 nm. The MoOx-PEG-Mel nanosheets efficiently convert NIR light to heat, possessing a photothermal conversion efficiency of 61.7%. They can also be loaded with doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX), giving a high drug loading (325.6 mg DOX/g MoOx-PEG-Mel). DOX release from the formulation is influenced by both pH and NIR irradiation. Systematic in vitro and in vivo evaluations reveal that synergistic chemo- and photothermal therapy using MoOx-PEG-Mel-DOX can completely eradicate a tumor with no observable off-target cytotoxicity. This is the first report of the fabrication of enhanced photothermal agents by combining MoOx nanosheets and a natural product. This work proffers a strategy for efficiently treating cancer as well as potentially extending the photothermal applications of 2D nanomaterials by surface melanin functionalization.", "AuthorKeywords": ["drug delivery system", "melanin", "MoOx", "photothermal", "synergistic therapy", "two-dimensional nanomaterials"], "IndexKeywords": ["Doxorubicin hydrochloride", "Drug delivery system", "MoOx", "Multifunctional platforms", "Photo-thermal", "Photothermal applications", "Photothermal conversion efficiencies", "synergistic therapy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074196049", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Biochemistry (medical)", "MEDI", "2704"]], "AuthorData": {"57207042887": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "57207042887", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Donghua University"}, "57194273124": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "57194273124", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Donghua University"}, "57193713166": {"Name": "Niu S.", "AuthorID": "57193713166", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Donghua University"}, "57205219186": {"Name": "Yang Y.", "AuthorID": "57205219186", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Donghua University"}, "57207691735": {"Name": "Zhang X.", "AuthorID": "57207691735", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Donghua University"}, "57211502214": {"Name": "Fu Z.", "AuthorID": "57211502214", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Donghua University"}, "55710395600": {"Name": "Zhu L.M.", "AuthorID": "55710395600", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Donghua University"}, "7406083266": {"Name": "Williams G.R.", "AuthorID": "7406083266", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "55339630600": {"Name": "Zhou J.", "AuthorID": "55339630600", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "Research Center for Analysis and Measurement, Donghua University"}, "57192980168": {"Name": "Li D.", "AuthorID": "57192980168", "AffiliationID": "60009860, 60121940", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopedics, Shanghai Pudong Hospital, Fudan University, Pudong Medical Center"}}}
