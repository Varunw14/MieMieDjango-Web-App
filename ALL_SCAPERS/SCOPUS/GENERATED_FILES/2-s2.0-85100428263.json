The clinical significance of this finding is unclear. We assessed whether recurrent GEJIM is associated with increased risk of subsequent dysplasia and whether endoscopic treatment lowers this risk. Methods: A retrospective, multicenter, cohort study was performed of treated BE patients who achieved complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia (IM). Postablation follow-up was performed at standard intervals. Recurrent GEJIM was defined as nondysplastic IM on gastroesophageal junction biopsy specimens without endoscopic evidence of BE. Patients were categorized as \u201cnever-GEJIM,\u201d \u201cGEJIM-observed,\u201d or \u201cGEJIM-treated.\u201d Endoscopic treatment for recurrent GEJIM was at the endoscopists\u2019 discretion. The primary outcome was dysplasia recurrence. Analyses were performed using log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazards modeling. Results: Six hundred thirty-three patients were analyzed; median follow-up was 47 months (interquartile range, 24-69). Most patients (81%) had high-grade dysplasia or intramucosal adenocarcinoma before treatment. Dysplasia recurrence was 2.2% per year. GEJIM-observed patients had the lowest rate of recurrence ( .6%/y) followed by GEJIM-treated (2.2%/y) and never-GEJIM (2.6%/y) (log-rank P = .07). In multivariate analyses, compared with never-GEJIM, the risk of dysplasia recurrence was significantly lower in GEJIM-observed patients (adjusted hazard ratio, .19; 95% confidence interval, .05- .81) and not different in GEJIM-treated patients (adjusted hazard ratio, .81; 95% confidence interval, .39-1.67). Older age and longer initial BE length were independently associated with recurrence. Conclusions: Recurrent GEJIM after endoscopic eradication of BE was not associated with an increased risk of subsequent dysplasia. Future studies are warranted to determine if observation is appropriate for this finding.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85100428263", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"57204764445": {"Name": "Solfisburg Q.S.", "AuthorID": "57204764445", "AffiliationID": "60027565", "AffiliationName": "Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center"}, "55225989800": {"Name": "Gabre J.", "AuthorID": "55225989800", "AffiliationID": "60027565", "AffiliationName": "Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center"}, "56845193700": {"Name": "Soroush A.", "AuthorID": "56845193700", "AffiliationID": "60027565", "AffiliationName": "Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center"}, "6603165928": {"Name": "Poneros J.M.", "AuthorID": "6603165928", "AffiliationID": "60027565", "AffiliationName": "Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center"}, "7005834294": {"Name": "Lightdale C.J.", "AuthorID": "7005834294", "AffiliationID": "60027565", "AffiliationName": "Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center"}, "57205885879": {"Name": "Abrams J.A.", "AuthorID": "57205885879", "AffiliationID": "60027565", "AffiliationName": "Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center"}, "55912766000": {"Name": "Sami S.S.", "AuthorID": "55912766000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Targeted Intervention, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "57212680285": {"Name": "Dhaliwal L.", "AuthorID": "57212680285", "AffiliationID": "60005558", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic"}, "57221120778": {"Name": "Wang K.K.", "AuthorID": "57221120778", "AffiliationID": "60005558", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic"}, "55369361300": {"Name": "Iyer P.G.", "AuthorID": "55369361300", "AffiliationID": "60005558", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic"}, "57201678661": {"Name": "Beveridge C.", "AuthorID": "57201678661", "AffiliationID": "60003711, 60006297", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania"}, "57203082897": {"Name": "Falk G.W.", "AuthorID": "57203082897", "AffiliationID": "60003711, 60006297", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania"}, "57220873889": {"Name": "Ginsberg G.G.", "AuthorID": "57220873889", "AffiliationID": "60003711, 60006297", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania"}, "57221850227": {"Name": "Jin Z.", "AuthorID": "57221850227", "AffiliationID": "60027565, 60030162", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Biostatistics, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University"}}}
