Here we determine the distribution, drivers and threats to large trees and high carbon forest. Location: Central Africa. Time period: Current. Major taxa studied: Trees. Methods: Using Gabon's new National Resource Inventory of 104 field sites, AGC was calculated from 67,466 trees from 578 species and 97 genera. Power and Michaelis\u2013Menten models assessed the contribution of large trees to AGC. Environmental and anthropogenic drivers of AGC, large trees, and stand variables were modelled using Akaike\u2019s information criterion (AIC) weights to calculate average regression coefficients for all p. ossible models. Results: Mean AGC for trees \u2265 10 cm DBH in Gabonese forestlands was 141.7 Mg C/ha, with averages of 166.6, 171.3 and 96.6 Mg C/ha in old growth, concession and secondary forest. High carbon forests occurred where large trees are most abundant: 31% of AGC was stored in large trees (2.3% of all stems). Human activities largely drove variation in AGC and large trees, but climate and edaphic conditions also determined stand variables (basal area, tree height, wood density, stem density). AGC and large trees increased with distance from human settlements; AGC was 40% lower in secondary than primary and concession forests and 33% higher in protected than non-managed areas. Main conclusions: AGC and large trees were negatively associated with human activities, highlighting the importance of forest management. Redefining large trees as \u2265 50 cm DBH (4.3% more stems) would account for 20% more AGC. This study demonstrates that protecting relatively undisturbed forests can be disproportionately effective in conserving carbon and suggests that including sustainable forestry in programs like reduced emissions for deforestation and forest degradation could maintain carbon dense forests in logging concessions that are a large proportion of remaining Central African forests.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aboveground biomass", "carbon", "Central Africa", "climate change", "Gabon", "large trees", "tree height", "tropical forest", "wood density"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088045752", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"]], "AuthorData": {"57218538821": {"Name": "Poulsen J.R.", "AuthorID": "57218538821", "AffiliationID": "106980662", "AffiliationName": "Agence Nationale des Parcs Nationaux"}, "57190804768": {"Name": "Medjibe V.P.", "AuthorID": "57190804768", "AffiliationID": "106980662", "AffiliationName": "Agence Nationale des Parcs Nationaux"}, "55436733800": {"Name": "Miao Z.", "AuthorID": "55436733800", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Nicholas School of the Environment, Duke University"}, "55868016300": {"Name": "Beirne C.", "AuthorID": "55868016300", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Nicholas School of the Environment, Duke University"}, "34969023300": {"Name": "Clark C.J.", "AuthorID": "34969023300", "AffiliationID": "106980662", "AffiliationName": "Agence Nationale des Parcs Nationaux"}, "57221218061": {"Name": "Lee M.E.", "AuthorID": "57221218061", "AffiliationID": "106980662", "AffiliationName": "Agence Nationale des Parcs Nationaux"}, "56666963000": {"Name": "Nu\u00f1ez C.L.", "AuthorID": "56666963000", "AffiliationID": "115943711", "AffiliationName": "German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research"}, "7402225781": {"Name": "White L.J.T.", "AuthorID": "7402225781", "AffiliationID": "60025200", "AffiliationName": "African Forest Ecology Group, School of Natural Sciences, University of Stirling"}, "57218134805": {"Name": "Banak-Ngok L.", "AuthorID": "57218134805", "AffiliationID": "100469634", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Recherche en Ecologie Tropicale"}, "26639333200": {"Name": "Cuni-Sanchez A.", "AuthorID": "26639333200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}, "7006197933": {"Name": "Disney M.", "AuthorID": "7006197933", "AffiliationID": "60033125, 60007317", "AffiliationName": "NERC National Centre for Earth Observation, University of Leicester"}, "56105640400": {"Name": "Lewis S.L.", "AuthorID": "56105640400", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, University of Leeds"}, "57191898959": {"Name": "Doucet J.L.", "AuthorID": "57191898959", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "TERRA Teaching and Research Centre, Forest is Life, Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech, Universit\u00e9 de Li\u00e8ge"}, "23994079400": {"Name": "Mitchard E.", "AuthorID": "23994079400", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of GeoSciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "7004204083": {"Name": "Reitsma J.", "AuthorID": "7004204083", "AffiliationID": "60020501", "AffiliationName": "Bureau Waardenburg"}, "7003557623": {"Name": "Saatchi S.", "AuthorID": "7003557623", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Environment and Sustainability, University of California"}, "57220966970": {"Name": "Scott C.T.", "AuthorID": "57220966970", "AffiliationID": "124782260", "AffiliationName": "US Forest Service, SilvaCarbon Program"}}}
