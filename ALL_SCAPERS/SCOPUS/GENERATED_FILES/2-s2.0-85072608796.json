Design Qualitative study design using semistructured interviews and focus groups. Setting Hospitals across the UK and recruitment through UK sarcoma charities and support groups. Methods Semistructured telephone/face-to-face interviews and focus groups with a purposive sample of 26 participants. Data were analysed using Framework Analysis. Participants Patients (n=26) with primary bone cancer aged 13-77 years. The majority were male (69%), white (85%); diagnosed within 4 years (54%); and had lower limb sarcoma (65%). Ten participants had undergone an upper/lower limb amputation (39%). Results The health-related quality-of-life domains of physical, emotional and social well-being and healthcare professionals' role were the overarching themes of analysis. The physical domain anchored patient experiences. The intensity and length of treatment, the severity of side-effects, the level of disability after surgery and the uncertainty of their prognosis had an impact on patient's self-image, confidence, mood and identity, and caused disruption to various aspects of the patients' social life, including their relationships (emotional and sexual) and participation in work/school and leisure activities. Adaptation was influenced by the way patients dealt with stress and adversity, with some finding a new outlook in life, and others struggling with finding their a \u20ac new normal'. Family and friends were the main source of support. Healthcare professional's expertise and support was critical. Rehabilitation services had a considerable role in patient's physical and emotional well-being, but inequitable access to these services was apparent. Conclusions This study described the impact of primary bone cancer on patients' well-being and adjustment over time with the identification of influencing factors of better/worse experiences. It showed that impact was felt after end of treatment and affected patients at different life stages. Holistic models of survivorship care are needed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["patient experience", "primary bone cancer", "quality of life"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Psychological", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Amputation", "Anxiety", "Body Image", "Bone Neoplasms", "Depression", "Female", "Focus Groups", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Professional Role", "Qualitative Research", "Quality of Life", "Self-Help Groups", "Social Support", "Stress, Psychological", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072608796", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57054859300": {"Name": "Martins A.", "AuthorID": "57054859300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010088", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Division, University College, London Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7202609757": {"Name": "Whelan J.S.", "AuthorID": "7202609757", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010088", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Division, University College, London Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "23979721800": {"Name": "Fern L.A.", "AuthorID": "23979721800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010088", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Division, University College, London Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57207567713": {"Name": "Onasanya M.", "AuthorID": "57207567713", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010088", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Division, University College, London Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "26536901000": {"Name": "Windsor R.", "AuthorID": "26536901000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010088", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Division, University College, London Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57202910374": {"Name": "Taylor R.M.", "AuthorID": "57202910374", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010088", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Division, University College, London Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57204210351": {"Name": "Bennister L.", "AuthorID": "57204210351", "AffiliationID": "123239057", "AffiliationName": "WMUK - Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinaemia UK"}, "6601971004": {"Name": "Gerrand C.", "AuthorID": "6601971004", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Sarcoma Service Royal National, Orthopaedic Hospital Stanmore"}, "8788970500": {"Name": "Storey L.", "AuthorID": "8788970500", "AffiliationID": "60100434", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Birmingham City University"}, "15924425200": {"Name": "Wells M.", "AuthorID": "15924425200", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "57207568968": {"Name": "Woodford J.", "AuthorID": "57207568968", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010088", "AffiliationName": "CNMAR, University College, London Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
