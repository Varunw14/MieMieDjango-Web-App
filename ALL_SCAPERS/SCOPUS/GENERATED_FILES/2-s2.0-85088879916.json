All rights reserved.The Cretaceous/Paleogene mass extinction, 66 Ma, included the demise of non-avian dinosaurs. Intense debate has focused on the relative roles of Deccan volcanism and the Chicxulub asteroid impact as kill mechanisms for this event. Here, we combine fossil-occurrence data with paleoclimate and habitat suitability models to evaluate dinosaur habitability in the wake of various asteroid impact and Deccan volcanism scenarios. Asteroid impact models generate a prolonged cold winter that suppresses potential global dinosaur habitats. Conversely, long-term forcing from Deccan volcanism (carbon dioxide [CO2]-induced warming) leads to increased habitat suitability. Short-term (aerosol cooling) volcanism still allows equatorial habitability. These results support the asteroid impact as the main driver of the non-avian dinosaur extinction. By contrast, induced warming from volcanism mitigated the most extreme effects of asteroid impact, potentially reducing the extinction severity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chicxulub", "Deccan", "Dinosauria", "End-Cretaceous", "Extinction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Carbon Dioxide", "Climate", "Dinosaurs", "Extinction, Biological", "Fossils", "History, Ancient", "India", "Mexico", "Minor Planets", "Models, Biological", "Paleontology", "Volcanic Eruptions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088879916", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55902353300": {"Name": "Chiarenza A.A.", "AuthorID": "55902353300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "57215106650": {"Name": "Morgan J.V.", "AuthorID": "57215106650", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "7005315387": {"Name": "Allison P.A.", "AuthorID": "7005315387", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "25632385300": {"Name": "Mannion P.D.", "AuthorID": "25632385300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "56740520800": {"Name": "Farnsworth A.", "AuthorID": "56740520800", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Geographical Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "8068419200": {"Name": "Lunt D.J.", "AuthorID": "8068419200", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Geographical Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "56033135100": {"Name": "Valdes P.J.", "AuthorID": "56033135100", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Geographical Sciences, University of Bristol"}}}
