In this review, we outline key issues in managing these patients. Specifically, we address issues relating to pre-operative planning, avoidance of shunt-related complications such as infection and malfunction, and specific management of neurological symptoms in the post-operative period. A retrospective study was carried out analysing correspondence between general surgeons and a specialist hydrocephalus unit over a 4-year period relating to management of patients with ventriculoperitoneal and lumboperitoneal shunts undergoing abdominal or pelvic surgery. A literature review was carried out to identify available evidence in this field. 30 queries from general surgeons were identified comprising 12 main themes. 16 relevant publications were identified. We summarised these to answer these queries. The management of shunted patients may present challenges and uncertainties in an abdominal or pelvic surgery setting. This paper provides guidelines and clarity in this field by discussing and summarising reported data in the literature.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Abdominal surgery", "CSF-Diverting shunt", "Neurosurgery", "Pelvic surgery", "Shunt"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074699855", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"]], "AuthorData": {"57221024405": {"Name": "Goel A.", "AuthorID": "57221024405", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56419604800": {"Name": "Craven C.", "AuthorID": "56419604800", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "37011334300": {"Name": "Matloob S.", "AuthorID": "37011334300", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57192996092": {"Name": "Thompson S.", "AuthorID": "57192996092", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7102438957": {"Name": "Watkins L.", "AuthorID": "7102438957", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "22958811100": {"Name": "Toma A.", "AuthorID": "22958811100", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
