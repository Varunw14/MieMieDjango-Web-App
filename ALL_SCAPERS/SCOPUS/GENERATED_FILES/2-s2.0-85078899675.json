Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are a key part of their function. There are more than 645,000 reported disease-relevant PPIs in the human interactome, but drugs have been developed for only 2% of these targets. The advances in PPI-focused drug discovery are highly dependent on the availability of structural data and accurate computational tools for analysis of this data. Quantum mechanical approaches are often too expensive computationally, but the fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method offers an excellent solution that combines accuracy, speed and the ability to reveal key interactions that would otherwise be hard to detect. FMO provides essential information for PPI drug discovery, namely, identification of key interactions formed between residues of two proteins, including their strength (in kcal/mol) and their chemical nature (electrostatic or hydrophobic). In this chapter, we have demonstrated how three different FMO-based approaches (pair interaction energy analysis (PIE analysis), subsystem analysis (SA) and analysis of protein residue networks (PRNs)) have been applied to study PPI in three protein-protein complexes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Binding energy", "Desolvation penalty", "Efficiency centrality", "FMO", "Fragment molecular orbital", "Molecular recognition", "Network analysis of protein residue networks", "Pair interaction energy", "PIE", "PIE-PRN", "PPI", "PRN", "Protein residue networks", "Protein-protein interactions", "QM", "Quantum mechanics", "Subsystem analysis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078899675", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"7003508743": {"Name": "Heifetz A.", "AuthorID": "7003508743", "AffiliationID": "60102134", "AffiliationName": "Evotec (UK) Ltd."}, "57203774611": {"Name": "Sladek V.", "AuthorID": "57203774611", "AffiliationID": "60010330", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemistry, Centre for Glycomics, Slovak Academy of Sciences"}, "6701753724": {"Name": "Townsend-Nicholson A.", "AuthorID": "6701753724", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Structural & Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "56842563500": {"Name": "Fedorov D.G.", "AuthorID": "56842563500", "AffiliationID": "60024621", "AffiliationName": "Research Center for Computational Design of Advanced Functional Materials (CD-FMat), National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST)"}}}
