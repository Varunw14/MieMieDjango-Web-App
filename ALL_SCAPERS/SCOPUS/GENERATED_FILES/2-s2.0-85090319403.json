The Attachment Network Q-sort (ANQ) is a self-report, quasi-qualitative instrument that discriminates relationship-specific attachment styles for multiple attachment figures. The current study assesses the properties of the ANQ in psychotherapy patients and in non-patient respondents, using mother, father and romantic partner as possible attachment figures. Analyzing the ANQ-data with latent class analysis, we found four types or classes of participants: a group with an overall secure profile, a group only insecure for father, a group only insecure for mother, and a group insecure for mother as well as father but not for partner (if available). These profiles proved to have good concurrent, discriminant and construct validity. We conclude that the ANQ is potentially a useful alternative clinical self-report instrument to assess combinations of attachment styles for a range of attachment figures such as parents and a romantic partner.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Affect", "Child Abuse", "Female", "Humans", "Interpersonal Relations", "Latent Class Analysis", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Object Attachment", "Personality", "Q-Sort", "Reproducibility of Results", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090319403", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"9279758100": {"Name": "Kamperman A.M.", "AuthorID": "9279758100", "AffiliationID": "117005376", "AffiliationName": "Epidemiological and Social Psychiatric Research Institute"}, "6603951749": {"Name": "Kooiman C.G.", "AuthorID": "6603951749", "AffiliationID": "100357707", "AffiliationName": "Viersprong Institute for Studies on Personality Disorder (VISPD)"}, "57190172862": {"Name": "Aleknaviciute J.", "AuthorID": "57190172862", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Erasmus Medical Center"}, "55940939400": {"Name": "Lorenzini N.", "AuthorID": "55940939400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical,, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "57215570165": {"Name": "Fonagy P.", "AuthorID": "57215570165", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical,, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "7406423490": {"Name": "Allen J.G.", "AuthorID": "7406423490", "AffiliationID": "60002441", "AffiliationName": "Baylor College of Medicine"}}}
