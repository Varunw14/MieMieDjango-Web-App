The structural space group is found to be predominantly R3\u00afc, with a minor (5%) fraction of Pnma phase. This phase fraction does not change in the measured temperature range of 4 K to 300 K. Our high-resolution diffraction data allow a detailed analysis of the spin orientation. Using representational analysis, we find the ferromagnetic state below Tc=246 K has spins oriented perpendicular to the rhombohedral c-axis and is purely ferromagnetic i.e. no canting between sublattices is observed. Implications for the magnetocaloric effect are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Magnetocaloric effect", "Manganite", "Neutron powder diffraction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Diffraction data", "Ferromagnetic state", "High-resolution neutron powder diffraction", "Lanthanum manganites", "Measured temperatures", "Phase fractions", "Spin orientations", "Structural and magnetic properties"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076025612", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57213396088": {"Name": "Larsen C.B.", "AuthorID": "57213396088", "AffiliationID": "60016576, 60031135", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics, Czech Academy of Sciences, Na Slovance"}, "56958475000": {"Name": "Samothrakitis S.", "AuthorID": "56958475000", "AffiliationID": "60016576, 60031135", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics, Czech Academy of Sciences, Na Slovance"}, "7004475745": {"Name": "Fortes A.D.", "AuthorID": "7004475745", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "40460912600": {"Name": "Aya\u015f A.O.", "AuthorID": "40460912600", "AffiliationID": "60086192", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Technology, Department of Mechatronics Engineering, Ad\u0131yaman University"}, "55515652900": {"Name": "Akyol M.", "AuthorID": "55515652900", "AffiliationID": "112915632", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering, Department of Materials Engineering, Adana Alparslan T\u00fcrke\u015f Science and Technology University"}, "7801316371": {"Name": "Ekicibil A.", "AuthorID": "7801316371", "AffiliationID": "60032587", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Science and Letters, Department of Physics, \u00c7ukurova University"}, "16309878600": {"Name": "Laver M.", "AuthorID": "16309878600", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}}}
