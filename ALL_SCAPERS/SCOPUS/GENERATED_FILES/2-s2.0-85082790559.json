Published by BMJ.Objective We examined the association between frailty and disability in rural community-dwelling older adults in Kegalle district of Sri Lanka. Design A population-based cross-sectional study. Participants A total of 746 community-dwelling adults aged \u226560 years. Primary and secondary outcome measures Frailty was assessed using the Fried phenotype. Disability was operationalised in terms of having one or more activity limitation/s in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) and basic activities of daily living (BADL). Results The median age of the sample was (median 68; IQR 64-75) years and 56.7% were female. 15.2% were frail and 48.5% were prefrail. The prevalence of \u22651 IADL limitations was high, 84.4% among frail adults. 38.7% of frail adults reported \u22651 BADL limitations. Over half of frail older adults (58.3%) reported both \u22651 physical and cognitive IADL limitations. Being frail decreased the odds of having no IADL limitations, and was associated with a higher count of IADL limitations. No significant association was found between prefrailty and number of IADL limitations. Conclusions The prevalence of \u22651 IADL limitations was high among rural community-dwelling frail older adults. Findings imply the greater support and care required for rural Sri Lankan frail older adults to live independently in the community.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Asia", "disability", "frail elderly", "independent living", "Sri Lanka"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082790559", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57201030779": {"Name": "Siriwardhana D.D.", "AuthorID": "57201030779", "AffiliationID": "60071104", "AffiliationName": "Department of Disability Studies, Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya"}, "6602151058": {"Name": "Rait G.", "AuthorID": "6602151058", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "57203175207": {"Name": "Walters K.R.", "AuthorID": "57203175207", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "15844556600": {"Name": "Weerasinghe M.C.", "AuthorID": "15844556600", "AffiliationID": "60071074, 60071075", "AffiliationName": "Department of Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo"}, "35363010600": {"Name": "Scholes S.", "AuthorID": "35363010600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
