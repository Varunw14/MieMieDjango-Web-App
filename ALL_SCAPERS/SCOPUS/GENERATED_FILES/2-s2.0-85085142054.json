Magnetic Resonance in Medicine published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of International Society for Magnetic Resonance in MedicinePurpose: The gradient-echo MR signal in brain white matter depends on the orientation of the fibers with respect to the external magnetic field. To map microstructure-specific magnetic susceptibility in orientationally heterogeneous material, it is thus imperative to regress out unwanted orientation effects. Methods: This work introduces a novel framework, referred to as microscopic susceptibility anisotropy imaging, that disentangles the 2 principal effects conflated in gradient-echo measurements, (a) the susceptibility properties of tissue microenvironments, especially the myelin microstructure, and (b) the axon orientation distribution relative to the magnetic field. Specifically, we utilize information about the orientational tissue structure inferred from diffusion MRI data to factor out the B0-direction dependence of the frequency difference signal. Results: A human pilot study at 3 T demonstrates proxy maps of microscopic susceptibility anisotropy unconfounded by fiber crossings and orientation dispersion as well as magnetic field direction. The developed technique requires only a dual-echo gradient-echo scan acquired at 1 or 2 head orientations with respect to the magnetic field and a 2-shell diffusion protocol achievable on standard scanners within practical scan times. Conclusions: The quantitative recovery of microscopic susceptibility features in the presence of orientational heterogeneity potentially improves the assessment of microstructural tissue integrity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["brain white matter", "gradient-echo MR imaging", "microscopic frequency shift", "orientational tissue heterogeneity", "spherical mean technique (SMT)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Direction dependence", "External magnetic field", "Frequency differences", "Heterogeneous materials", "Magnetic field direction", "Orientation distributions", "Specific magnetic susceptibility", "Susceptibility anisotropy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085142054", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"21834356800": {"Name": "Kaden E.", "AuthorID": "21834356800", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57216882572": {"Name": "Gyori N.G.", "AuthorID": "57216882572", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7402830766": {"Name": "Alexander D.C.", "AuthorID": "7402830766", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "55290679000": {"Name": "Clark C.A.", "AuthorID": "55290679000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57211071756": {"Name": "Rudrapatna S.U.", "AuthorID": "57211071756", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre, Cardiff University"}, "16935234900": {"Name": "Jones D.K.", "AuthorID": "16935234900", "AffiliationID": "60010679", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Australian Catholic University"}, "57220286156": {"Name": "Barskaya I.Y.", "AuthorID": "57220286156", "AffiliationID": "60003915", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Imaging Science, Vanderbilt University"}, "7003754525": {"Name": "Does M.D.", "AuthorID": "7003754525", "AffiliationID": "60003915", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Imaging Science, Vanderbilt University"}, "19638362500": {"Name": "Dragonu I.", "AuthorID": "19638362500", "AffiliationID": "119704954", "AffiliationName": "Siemens Healthcare Ltd"}}}
