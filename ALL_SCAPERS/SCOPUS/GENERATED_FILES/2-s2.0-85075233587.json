We propose two methods for solving the power allocation problem namely the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm and the deep learning-based method. In the WMMSE algorithm, we solve the problem using block coordinate descent (BCD) method. Then we adopt supervised learning technique for the deep neural network (DNN) based approach considering the power allocation from the WMMSE algorithm as the target output. We exploit an efficient implementation of the mini-batch gradient descent algorithm for training the DNN. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the DNN algorithm can provide very good approximation of the iterative WMMSE algorithm yet reducing the computational overhead significantly.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deep learning", "Deep neural network", "Machine learning", "Power control", "Resource allocation", "V2V", "V2X"], "IndexKeywords": ["Block coordinate descents", "Computational overheads", "Efficient implementation", "Extensive simulations", "Gradient descent algorithms", "Learning-based methods", "Minimum mean square errors", "Transmit power allocation"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075233587", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"57211890704": {"Name": "Gao J.", "AuthorID": "57211890704", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Physical Sciences, Heriot-Watt University"}, "36632507800": {"Name": "Khandaker M.R.A.", "AuthorID": "36632507800", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Physical Sciences, Heriot-Watt University"}, "49864907300": {"Name": "Tariq F.", "AuthorID": "49864907300", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "James Watt School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "7404759940": {"Name": "Wong K.K.", "AuthorID": "7404759940", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56693715000": {"Name": "Khan R.T.", "AuthorID": "56693715000", "AffiliationID": "60029276", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Information Technology, Jahangirnagar University"}}}
