However, studies examining micro-Doppler classification using passive WiFi radar have relied on manually stimulating WiFi access points to increase the bandwidths and duty-cycles of transmissions; either through file-downloads to generate high data-rate signals, or increasing the repetition frequency of the WiFi beacon signal from its default setting. In real-world scenarios, both these approaches would require user access to the WiFi network or WiFi access point through password authentication, and therefore involve a level of cooperation which cannot always be relied upon e.g. in law-enforcement applications. In this research, we investigate WiFi activity classification using just WiFi probe response signals which can be generated using a low-cost off-the-shelf secondary device (Raspberry Pi) eliminating the requirement to actually connect to the WiFi network. This removes the need to have continuous data traffic in the network or to modify the firmware configuration to manipulate the beacon signal interval, making the technology deployable in all situations. An activity recognition model based on a convolutional neural network resulted in an overall classification accuracy of 75% when trained from scratch using 300 measured WiFi probe-response samples across 6 classes. This value is then increased to 82%, with significantly less training when adopting a transfer learning approach: initial training using WiFi data traffic signals, followed by fine-tuning using probe response signals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Activity Recognition", "Passive WiFi Doppler Radar", "Probe Response", "Transfer Learning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Activity classifications", "Activity recognition", "Classification accuracy", "Convolutional neural network", "Password authentication", "Repetition frequency", "Transfer learning", "Wi-fi access points"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073097523", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"57211240560": {"Name": "Shi F.", "AuthorID": "57211240560", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Computer Science"}, "7003972937": {"Name": "Julier S.", "AuthorID": "7003972937", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Computer Science"}, "34867832000": {"Name": "Chetty K.", "AuthorID": "34867832000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Security and Crime Science"}}}
