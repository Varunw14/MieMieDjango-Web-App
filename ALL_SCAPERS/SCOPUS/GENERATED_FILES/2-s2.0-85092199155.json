We collected resident, family carer, and staff demographics. Staff provided data on resident's agitation, pain, quality of life, and service receipt. Staff reported their sense of competence in dementia care. Family carers reported on satisfaction with end-of-life care. In qualitative interviews, we explored staff and family carers' views on the intervention.Results:The target three NHs participated: 28 (49%) residents, 53 (74%) staff, and 11 (85%) family carers who were eligible to participate consented. Eight-four percent of staff attended \u22653 sessions, and we achieved 93% follow-up. We were able to complete quantitative interviews. Staff and family carers reported the intervention and delivery were acceptable and helpful.Conclusions:The intervention was feasible and acceptable indicating a larger trial for effectiveness may be warranted.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Agitation", "Dementia", "Feasibility study", "Nursing home", "Palliative care"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092199155", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Gerontology", "NURS", "2909"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7005604974": {"Name": "Sampson E.L.", "AuthorID": "7005604974", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Unit, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "7403339089": {"Name": "Moore K.", "AuthorID": "7403339089", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Unit, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "7402350547": {"Name": "Barber J.", "AuthorID": "7402350547", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, Priment Clinical Trials Unit, University College"}, "57219314938": {"Name": "Gillam J.", "AuthorID": "57219314938", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Old Age Psychiatry, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "57193413264": {"Name": "La Frenais F.", "AuthorID": "57193413264", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Old Age Psychiatry, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "57205036987": {"Name": "Lambe K.", "AuthorID": "57205036987", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Old Age Psychiatry, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "23477379100": {"Name": "Laybourne A.", "AuthorID": "23477379100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Old Age Psychiatry, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "57192986793": {"Name": "Stringer A.", "AuthorID": "57192986793", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Old Age Psychiatry, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "57194619993": {"Name": "Webster L.", "AuthorID": "57194619993", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Old Age Psychiatry, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "7006347341": {"Name": "Livingston G.", "AuthorID": "7006347341", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Old Age Psychiatry, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "6602151156": {"Name": "Manela M.", "AuthorID": "6602151156", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "6603627308": {"Name": "Marston L.", "AuthorID": "6603627308", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "57205708660": {"Name": "Panca M.", "AuthorID": "57205708660", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}}}
