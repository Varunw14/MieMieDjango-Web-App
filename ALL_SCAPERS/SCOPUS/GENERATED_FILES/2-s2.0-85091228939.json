All right reserved.Based on the multi-stage microwave curing regime, fly ash groups rich in various micro-bead(carbon particle, floating bead and magnetic bead) were prepared in incorporation various micro-bead into roasted fly ash, which were obtained by flotation, magnetic separation and roasting. The hydration behavior of the above micro-beads under microwave field and its effect on the early mechanical properties of alkali-activated fly ash-based cementitious materials(AAFA) were studied. And microscopic of samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction(XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectrometer(FTIR) and field emission scanning electron microscope(FESEM). The results show that the incorporation of 5% carbon particle has little effect on the early age compressive strength of microwave cured alkali-activated fly ash-based cementitious materials, while the addition of 5% floating bead and magnetic bead can significantly enhance their early compressive strength. In all samples, hydrosodalite and chabazite-Na form during microwave curing process. The addition of carbon particle, floating bead and magnetic bead has not cause the change of hydration products type of samples. The alkali-activating reaction take place both inside and outside the hollow floating bead simultaneously, thus floating bead can shorten the microwave curing duration of the samples to reach its peak strength.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alkali activated fly ash(AAFA)", "Hydration product", "Mechanical property", "Micro-bead", "Microwave curing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alkali-activated fly ashes", "Cementitious materials", "Field emission scanning electron microscopes", "Fourier transform infrared spectrometer", "Hydration behaviors", "Hydration products", "Microwave curing", "Microwave field"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091228939", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"]], "AuthorData": {"57219092101": {"Name": "Li X.", "AuthorID": "57219092101", "AffiliationID": "60031454", "AffiliationName": "Shaanxi Ecological Cement & Concrete Engineering Technology Research Center, Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology"}, "57060875100": {"Name": "Li H.", "AuthorID": "57060875100", "AffiliationID": "60031454", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Green Building in Western China, Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology"}, "55748516800": {"Name": "Zhu H.", "AuthorID": "55748516800", "AffiliationID": "60031454", "AffiliationName": "Shaanxi Ecological Cement & Concrete Engineering Technology Research Center, Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology"}, "57219094411": {"Name": "Qiao P.", "AuthorID": "57219094411", "AffiliationID": "60031454", "AffiliationName": "Shaanxi Ecological Cement & Concrete Engineering Technology Research Center, Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology"}, "55461062100": {"Name": "Bai Y.", "AuthorID": "55461062100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
