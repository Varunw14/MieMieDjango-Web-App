In this article, I examine how archaeologists use ethnographic data in their research on Neanderthals. An analysis of articles published in five international journals in the \u2018genomic era\u2019 of Neanderthal research (post-2010) shows that while not ubiquitous, many archaeologists use ethnographic data to interpret a range of Neanderthal behaviours. Several key patterns in the use of ethnographic data are identified, including limited engagement with ethnographic sources, the frequent use of data to substantiate a claim, or \u2018fill in the gaps\u2019 of a sparse archaeological record, and little acknowledgement of the problems or limitations of the application of these data to Neanderthal contexts. these practices may reflect the current trend in Neanderthal research which emphasises similarities with early Homo sapiens, and takes for granted the appropriateness of analogues with recent foragers. I argue that the prevailing use of ethnographic data does not account adequately for biological and cognitive differences between Neanderthals and Homo sapiens. I demonstrate this using the example of the effects of Neanderthal biology on demography and mobility and provide some recommendations for best practice of the use of ethnographic data in Neanderthal archaeological research.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ethnographic analogy", "Neanderthals", "Palaeolithic archaeology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076132855", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"57197614974": {"Name": "French J.", "AuthorID": "57197614974", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Archaeology"}}}
