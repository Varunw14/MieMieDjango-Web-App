The aim of the present study was to validate four miRNAs in saliva as potential predictive biomarkers of periodontal disease among patients with and without diabetes mellitus (DM). MiRNAs were extracted from the saliva of 24 adult subjects with DM and 29 healthy controls. Each group was subdivided into periodontally healthy or having periodontitis. In silico analysis identified 4 miRNAs (miRNA 155, 146 a/b and 203) as immune modulators. The expression of miRNAs-146a/b, 155, and 203 was tested using quantitative PCR. The expression levels in the study groups were compared to explore the effect of diabetes on periodontal status and vice versa. In our cohort, the four miRNAs expression were higher in patients with periodontitis and/or diabetes. miRNA-155 was the most reliable predictors of periodontitis among non-diabetics with an optimum cut-off value of < 8.97 with accuracy = 82.6%. MiRNA 146a, on the other hand, was the only reliable predictor of periodontitis among subjects with diabetes with optimum cut-off value of \u226511.04 with accuracy = 86.1%. The results of the present study concluded that MiRNA-146a and miRNA155 in saliva provide reliable, non-invasive, diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers that can be used to monitor periodontal health status among diabetic and non-diabetic patients.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Biomarkers", "Case-Control Studies", "Diabetes Complications", "Diabetes Mellitus", "Discriminant Analysis", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "MicroRNAs", "Middle Aged", "Periodontitis", "Pilot Projects", "Saliva", "Up-Regulation", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089170750", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"35263566400": {"Name": "Al-Rawi N.H.", "AuthorID": "35263566400", "AffiliationID": "60070813", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oral & Craniofacial Health Sciences, College of Dental Medicine, University of Sharjah"}, "54882295200": {"Name": "Al-Marzooq F.", "AuthorID": "54882295200", "AffiliationID": "60070823, 60008665", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Microbiology & Immunology, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, UAE University"}, "56069932200": {"Name": "Al-Nuaimi A.S.", "AuthorID": "56069932200", "AffiliationID": "112574913", "AffiliationName": "Primary Health Care Corporation (PHCC)"}, "55503841000": {"Name": "Hachim M.Y.", "AuthorID": "55503841000", "AffiliationID": "60108644", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine, Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences"}, "7003699541": {"Name": "Hamoudi R.", "AuthorID": "7003699541", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}}}
