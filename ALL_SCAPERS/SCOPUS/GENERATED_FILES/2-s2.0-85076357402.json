Using a three-dimensional semiclassical model, we identify the pathways that prevail non-sequential double ionization (NSDI). We focus mostly on the delayed pathway, where one electron ionizes with a time-delay after recollision. We have recently shown that the mechanism that prevails the delayed pathway depends on intensity. For low intensities slingshot-NSDI is the dominant mechanism. Here, we identify the differences in two-electron probability distributions of the prevailing NSDI pathways. This allows us to identify properties of the two-electron escape and thus gain significant insight into slingshot-NSDI. Interestingly, we find that an observable fingerpint of slingshot-NSDI is the two electrons escaping with large and roughly equal energies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076357402", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57205241380": {"Name": "Katsoulis G.P.", "AuthorID": "57205241380", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "6603477664": {"Name": "Emmanouilidou A.", "AuthorID": "6603477664", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
