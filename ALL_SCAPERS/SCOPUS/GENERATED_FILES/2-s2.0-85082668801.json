All rights reserved.Background: Progress towards the World Health Organization's End TB Strategy is monitored by assessing tuberculosis (TB) incidence, often derived from TB notification, assuming complete case detection and reporting. This assumption is unlikely to hold in many settings, including European Union (EU) countries. Aim: We aimed to assess observed and estimated completeness of TB notification through inventory studies and capture-recapture (CRC) methodology in six EU countries: Croatia, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Portugal Slovenia. Methods: We performed record linkage, case ascertainment and CRC analyses of data collected retrospectively from at least three national TB-related registers in each country between 2014 and 2016. Results: Observed completeness of TB notification by inventory studies was 73.9% in Croatia, 98.7% in Denmark, 83.6% in Finland, 81.6% in the Netherlands, 85.8% in Portugal and 100% in Slovenia. Subsequent CRC analysis estimated completeness of TB notification to be 98.4% in Denmark, 76.5% in Finland and 77.0% in Portugal. In Croatia, CRC analyses produced implausible results while in the Netherlands and Slovenia, it was methodologically considered not meaningful. Conclusion: Inventory studies and CRC methodology suggest a TB notification completeness between 73.9% and 100% in the six EU countries. Mandatory reporting by clinicians and laboratories, and cross-checking of registers, strongly contributes to accurate notification rates, but hospital episode registers likely contain a considerable proportion of false-positive TB records and are thus less useful. Further strengthening routine surveillance to count TB cases, i.e. incidence, accurately by employing record-linkage of high-quality TB registers should make CRC studies obsolete in EU countries.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Disease Notification", "European Union", "Humans", "Incidence", "Medical Record Linkage", "Population Surveillance", "Retrospective Studies", "Tuberculosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082668801", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"36980357800": {"Name": "Straetemans M.", "AuthorID": "36980357800", "AffiliationID": "60015027", "AffiliationName": "KIT Royal Tropical Institute, Health Unit"}, "8724639700": {"Name": "Bakker M.I.", "AuthorID": "8724639700", "AffiliationID": "60015027", "AffiliationName": "KIT Royal Tropical Institute, Health Unit"}, "17342239400": {"Name": "Alba S.", "AuthorID": "17342239400", "AffiliationID": "60015027", "AffiliationName": "KIT Royal Tropical Institute, Health Unit"}, "51764156000": {"Name": "Mergenthaler C.", "AuthorID": "51764156000", "AffiliationID": "60015027", "AffiliationName": "KIT Royal Tropical Institute, Health Unit"}, "36090264800": {"Name": "Rood E.", "AuthorID": "36090264800", "AffiliationID": "60015027", "AffiliationName": "KIT Royal Tropical Institute, Health Unit"}, "57220823708": {"Name": "Andersen P.H.", "AuthorID": "57220823708", "AffiliationID": "60020191, 60025543", "AffiliationName": "Statens Serum Institute, National Institute for Public Health, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Prevention"}, "57055354200": {"Name": "Schimmel H.", "AuthorID": "57055354200", "AffiliationID": "60026125", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), Centre for Infectious Disease Control"}, "8283672400": {"Name": "Simunovic A.", "AuthorID": "8283672400", "AffiliationID": "60018171", "AffiliationName": "Croatian Institute of Public Health, Infectious Disease Epidemiology Service"}, "57207942064": {"Name": "Svetina P.", "AuthorID": "57207942064", "AffiliationID": "112590784", "AffiliationName": "University Clinic of Pulmonary Diseases and Allergy Golnik, Department of Tuberculosis"}, "36479857300": {"Name": "Carvalho C.", "AuthorID": "36479857300", "AffiliationID": "123385017", "AffiliationName": "Portuguese Northern Regional Health Administration, Public Health Department"}, "7003400221": {"Name": "Lyytik\u00e4inen O.", "AuthorID": "7003400221", "AffiliationID": "60104546", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL)"}, "6602338051": {"Name": "Abubakar I.", "AuthorID": "6602338051", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College of London (UCL)"}, "15073716700": {"Name": "Harris R.J.", "AuthorID": "15073716700", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England (PHE), Statistics Unit"}, "6506595542": {"Name": "K\u00f6dm\u00f6n C.", "AuthorID": "6506595542", "AffiliationID": "60014991", "AffiliationName": "European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)"}, "57202571746": {"Name": "Van Der Werf M.J.", "AuthorID": "57202571746", "AffiliationID": "60014991", "AffiliationName": "European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)"}, "6602809956": {"Name": "Van Hest R.", "AuthorID": "6602809956", "AffiliationID": "60006027", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pulmonology and Tuberculosis, University Medical Centre Groningen (UMCG)"}}}
