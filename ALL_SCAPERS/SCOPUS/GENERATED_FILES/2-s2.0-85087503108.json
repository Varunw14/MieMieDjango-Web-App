Irradiation of host muscle enhances donor stem cell engraftment by promoting the proliferation of transplanted donor cells. We hypothesised that, similar to other systems, cells damaged by radiation might be effecting this donor cell proliferation. But we found no difference in the percentage of dying (TUNEL+) cells in immunodeficient dystrophic mouse muscles at the times after the irradiation dose that enhances donor cell engraftment. Similarly, irradiation did not significantly increase the number of TUNEL+ cells in non-dystrophic immunodeficient mouse muscles and it only slightly enhanced donor satellite cell engraftment in this mouse strain, suggesting either that the effector cells are present in greater numbers within dystrophic muscle, or that an innate immune response is required for effective donor cell engraftment. Donor cell engraftment within non-irradiated dystrophic host mouse muscles was not enhanced if they were transplanted with either satellite cells, or myofibres, derived from irradiated dystrophic mouse muscle. But a mixture of cells from irradiated muscle transplanted with donor satellite cells promoted donor cell engraftment in a few instances, suggesting that a rare, yet to be identified, cell type within irradiated dystrophic muscle enhances the donor stem cell-mediated regeneration. The mechanism by which cells within irradiated host muscle promote donor cell engraftment remains elusive.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Proliferation", "Female", "Gamma Rays", "Inflammation", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred mdx", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Muscular Dystrophy, Animal", "Regeneration", "Satellite Cells, Skeletal Muscle"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087503108", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57194828719": {"Name": "Doreste B.", "AuthorID": "57194828719", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre"}, "57192692127": {"Name": "Torelli S.", "AuthorID": "57192692127", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre"}, "35601353000": {"Name": "Morgan J.", "AuthorID": "35601353000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre"}}}
