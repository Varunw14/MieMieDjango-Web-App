Many maintain intact open reading frames and provirus expression together with HML2 particle formation are observed in early stage human embryo development and are associated with pluripotency as well as inflammatory disease, cancers and HIV-1 infection. Here, we reconstruct the core structural protein (CA) of an HML2 retrovirus, assemble particles in vitro and employ single particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine structures of four classes of CA Fullerene shell assemblies. These icosahedral and capsular assemblies reveal at high-resolution the molecular interactions that allow CA to form both pentamers and hexamers and show how invariant pentamers and structurally plastic hexamers associate to form the unique polyhedral structures found in retroviral cores.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Capsid", "Capsid Proteins", "Cryoelectron Microscopy", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "Endogenous Retroviruses", "Fullerenes", "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular", "Protein Structure, Quaternary", "Recombinant Proteins", "Single Molecule Imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076896669", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56921923000": {"Name": "Acton O.", "AuthorID": "56921923000", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Washington"}, "56673724900": {"Name": "Grant T.", "AuthorID": "56673724900", "AffiliationID": "60001224", "AffiliationName": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute"}, "24471790400": {"Name": "Sader K.", "AuthorID": "24471790400", "AffiliationID": "60032927", "AffiliationName": "Thermo Fisher Scientific Materials and Structural Analysis"}, "25925899200": {"Name": "Nans A.", "AuthorID": "25925899200", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Structural Biology of Cells and Viruses Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute"}, "57207750483": {"Name": "Rosenthal P.B.", "AuthorID": "57207750483", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Structural Biology of Cells and Viruses Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute"}, "6701748964": {"Name": "Nicastro G.", "AuthorID": "6701748964", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Macromolecular Structure Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute"}, "24537021500": {"Name": "Ball N.J.", "AuthorID": "24537021500", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Macromolecular Structure Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute"}, "6505920337": {"Name": "Goldstone D.C.", "AuthorID": "6505920337", "AffiliationID": "60115431, 60005686", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, University of Auckland"}, "56868170700": {"Name": "Robertson L.E.", "AuthorID": "56868170700", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Macromolecular Structure Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute"}, "7202126752": {"Name": "Taylor I.A.", "AuthorID": "7202126752", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Macromolecular Structure Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute"}, "57193001984": {"Name": "Ramos A.", "AuthorID": "57193001984", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "7006553905": {"Name": "Stoye J.P.", "AuthorID": "7006553905", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}}}
