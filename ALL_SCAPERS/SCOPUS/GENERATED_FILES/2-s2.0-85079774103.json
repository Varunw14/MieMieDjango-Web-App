All rights reserved.This chapter discusses the literature including likely mechanisms that are driving associations between calorie restriction and health outcomes. Calorie restriction refers to a reduction in energy intake well below the amount of calories that would be consumed ad libitum (\u226510% in human studies and usually 20% or higher in rodent species) but with adequate nutrition to prevent malnutrition. Since the seminal study by McCay and colleagues in 1935 many investigations have been carried out investigating the benefits of calorie restriction across a wide range of species. Calorie restricted monkeys have displayed a reduced age-related morbidity. In humans, data from controlled trials are scarce, importantly, no long-term prospective trials of calorie restriction have been carried out with mortality as the end-point. The current evidence from animal and human models show that calorie restriction is beneficial for physical health in humans likely resulting in increased longevity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CALERIE", "Calorie restriction", "Human studies", "Longevity", "Morbidity", "Mortality", "Nonhuman studies", "Nutrition", "Protocols", "Rhesus monkey"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079774103", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"37117793800": {"Name": "Smith L.", "AuthorID": "37117793800", "AffiliationID": "60000913", "AffiliationName": "Anglia Ruskin University"}, "55483054300": {"Name": "Roberts J.", "AuthorID": "55483054300", "AffiliationID": "60000913", "AffiliationName": "Anglia Ruskin University"}, "37004641300": {"Name": "Johnstone J.", "AuthorID": "37004641300", "AffiliationID": "60000913", "AffiliationName": "Anglia Ruskin University"}, "57196323380": {"Name": "Jackson S.E.", "AuthorID": "57196323380", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL"}, "36998781200": {"Name": "Veronese N.", "AuthorID": "36998781200", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "National Research Council, Neuroscience Institute"}, "57215806086": {"Name": "Yang L.", "AuthorID": "57215806086", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Medical University Vienna"}}}
