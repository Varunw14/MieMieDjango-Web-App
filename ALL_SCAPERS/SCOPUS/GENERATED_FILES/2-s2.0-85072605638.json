The procedure involves the positioning of artificial chords, whose length/tension is adjusted intraoperatively, adopting different methods based on the experience of the surgeon. This unsystematic approach occasionally leads to complications such as leaflet rupture and excessive/insufficient load on the neochords. In this study, finite element models of a generalized prolapsing mitral valve are used to verify the effect of two alternative tensioning approaches (AT \u2013 All together and 1-by-1 \u2013 one by one sequences) on the coaptation area and valve biomechanics, comparing results with a corresponding healthy configuration. The total force of about 1 N is exerted by the chords in both strategies, but the maximum stress and coaptation area are closer to those of the healthy configuration in the 1-by-1 sequence. However, the analysis also provides an explanation for the chords unloading in the 1-by-1 strategy observed in the clinical practice, and suggests an optimum tensioning methodology for NeoChord procedures. The study also reveals the potential power of the implemented numerical approach to serve as a tool for procedural planning, supporting the identification of the most suitable ventricular access site and the most effective stitching points for the artificial chords.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Finite elements analysis", "Mitral valve prolapse", "Mitral valve repair", "NeoChord procedure", "Tensioning strategies"], "IndexKeywords": ["Finite elements analysis", "Mitral valve prolapse", "Mitral valve repairs", "NeoChord procedure", "Tensioning strategies", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Coronary Circulation", "Mitral Valve", "Models, Cardiovascular", "Stress, Mechanical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072605638", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"57211079322": {"Name": "Di Micco L.", "AuthorID": "57211079322", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, ICEA Department, University of Padova"}, "55604533500": {"Name": "Peruzzo P.", "AuthorID": "55604533500", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, ICEA Department, University of Padova"}, "9737551500": {"Name": "Boso D.", "AuthorID": "9737551500", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, ICEA Department, University of Padova"}, "6507562754": {"Name": "Susin F.M.", "AuthorID": "6507562754", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, ICEA Department, University of Padova"}, "24340483200": {"Name": "Colli A.", "AuthorID": "24340483200", "AffiliationID": "60028868", "AffiliationName": "Cardiac Thoracic and Vascular Department University of Pisa"}, "6506017118": {"Name": "Burriesci G.", "AuthorID": "6506017118", "AffiliationID": "110119807", "AffiliationName": "Ri.MED Foundation"}, "55845147400": {"Name": "Besola L.", "AuthorID": "55845147400", "AffiliationID": "60000160", "AffiliationName": "DSCTV, University of Padova Medical School"}, "7005516149": {"Name": "Gerosa G.", "AuthorID": "7005516149", "AffiliationID": "60000160", "AffiliationName": "DSCTV, University of Padova Medical School"}}}
