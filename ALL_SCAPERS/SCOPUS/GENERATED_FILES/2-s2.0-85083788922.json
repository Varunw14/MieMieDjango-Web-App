Modelling neural damage in human systems is crucial to identifying species-specific responses to injury and potentially neurotoxic compounds leading to development of more effective neuroprotective agents. Hence we developed human neural stem cell (hNSC) 3-dimensional (3D) cultures and tested their potential for modelling neural insults, including hypoxic-ischaemic and Ca2+-dependent injury. Standard 3D conditions for rodent cells support neuroblastoma lines used as human CNS models, but not hNSCs, but in all cases changes in culture architecture alter gene expression. Importantly, response to damage differs in 2D and 3D cultures and this is not due to reduced drug accessibility. Together, this study highlights the impact of culture cytoarchitecture on hNSC phenotype and damage response, indicating that 3D models may be better predictors of in vivo response to damage and compound toxicity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cell Culture Techniques", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell Survival", "Cells, Cultured", "Central Nervous System", "Embryonic Stem Cells", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Glucose", "Humans", "Neural Stem Cells", "Neuroblastoma", "Neurons", "Oxygen", "Thapsigargin", "Trauma, Nervous System"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083788922", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"40262607700": {"Name": "Vagaska B.", "AuthorID": "40262607700", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Section, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57216526948": {"Name": "Gillham O.", "AuthorID": "57216526948", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Section, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57220386665": {"Name": "Ferretti P.", "AuthorID": "57220386665", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Section, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
