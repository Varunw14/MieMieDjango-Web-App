Escherichia coli strain Sanji was isolated from an outbreak of pheasant colibacillosis in Fujian province, China, in 2011. This strain has XDR properties, exhibiting sensitivity to carbapenems but no other classes of known antibiotics. Whole-genome sequencing revealed a total of 32 known antibiotic resistance genes, many associated with insertion sequence 26 (IS26) elements. These were found on the Sanji chromosome and 2 of its 6 plasmids, pSJ_255 and pSJ_82. The Sanji chromosome also harbors a type 2 secretion system (T2SS), a type 3 secretion system (T3SS), a type 6 secretion system (T6SS), and several putative prophages. Sanji and other ST167 strains have a previously uncharacterized O-antigen (O89b) that is most closely related to serotype O89 as determined on the basis of analysis of the wzm-wzt genes and in silico serotyping. This O89b-antigen gene cluster was also found in the genomes of a few other pathogenic sequence type 617 (ST617) and ST10 complex strains. A time-scaled phylogeny inferred from comparative single nucleotide variant analysis indicated that development of these O89b-containing lineages emerged about 30 years ago. Comparative sequence analysis revealed that the core genome of Sanji is nearly identical to that of several recently sequenced strains of pathogenic XDR E. coli belonging to the ST167 group. Comparison of the mobile elements among the different ST167 genomes revealed that each genome carries a distinct set of multidrug resistance genes on different types of plasmids, indicating that there are multiple paths toward the emergence of XDR in E. coli.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antibiotic resistance", "Capsular polysaccharide", "Extensively drug resistant", "Genome comparison", "Insertion sequence", "O-antigen", "Pathogen evolution", "Plasmid-mediated resistance", "Prophage", "Secretion systems"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071933538", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"55881559300": {"Name": "Zeng X.", "AuthorID": "55881559300", "AffiliationID": "60004630", "AffiliationName": "College of Life Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University"}, "55881402200": {"Name": "Chi X.", "AuthorID": "55881402200", "AffiliationID": "60004630", "AffiliationName": "College of Life Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University"}, "55270093600": {"Name": "Wang S.", "AuthorID": "55270093600", "AffiliationID": "60004630", "AffiliationName": "College of Life Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University"}, "7403080933": {"Name": "Ho M.", "AuthorID": "7403080933", "AffiliationID": "60007601, 60000745", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"}, "50761305400": {"Name": "Ho B.T.", "AuthorID": "50761305400", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "57216461765": {"Name": "Moon D.", "AuthorID": "57216461765", "AffiliationID": "60007601, 60000745", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"}, "35509126100": {"Name": "Wilson B.A.", "AuthorID": "35509126100", "AffiliationID": "60007601, 60000745", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"}, "57191344296": {"Name": "Lambert C.", "AuthorID": "57191344296", "AffiliationID": "60104897", "AffiliationName": "Pacific Biosciences"}, "57213045792": {"Name": "Hall R.J.", "AuthorID": "57213045792", "AffiliationID": "60104897", "AffiliationName": "Pacific Biosciences"}, "6506382112": {"Name": "Baybayan P.", "AuthorID": "6506382112", "AffiliationID": "60104897", "AffiliationName": "Pacific Biosciences"}}}
