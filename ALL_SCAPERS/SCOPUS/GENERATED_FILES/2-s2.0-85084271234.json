Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society of Toxicology.The metabolic fate, toxicity, and effects on endogenous metabolism of paracetamol (acetaminophen, APAP) in 22 female Landrace cross large white pigs were evaluated in a model of acute liver failure (ALF). Anesthetized pigs were initially dosed at 250 mg/kg via an oroduodenal tube with APAP serum concentrations maintained above 300 mg/l using maintenance doses of 0.5-4 g/h until ALF. Studies were undertaken to determine both the metabolic fate of APAP and its effects on the endogenous metabolic phenotype of ALF in using 1H NMR spectroscopy. Increased concentrations of citrate combined with pre-ALF increases in circulating lactate, pyruvate, and alanine in plasma suggest mitochondrial dysfunction and a switch in hepatic energy metabolism to glycolysis in response to APAP treatment. A specific liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay was used to quantify APAP and metabolites. The major circulating and urinary metabolite of APAP was the phenolic glucuronide (APAP-G), followed by p-aminophenol glucuronide (PAP-G) formed from N-deacetylated APAP. The PAP produced by N-deacetylation was the likely cause of the methemoglobinemia and kidney toxicity observed in this, and previous, studies in the pig. The phenolic sulfate of APAP, and the glutathione-derived metabolites of the drug were only found as minor components (with the cysteinyl conjugate detected but not the mercapturate). Given its low sulfation, combined with significant capacity for N-deacetylation the pig may represent a poor translational model for toxicology studies for compounds undergoing significant metabolism by sulfation, or which contain amide bonds which when hydrolyzed to unmask an aniline lead to toxicity. However, the pig may provide a useful model where extensive amide hydrolysis is seen for drugs or environmental chemicals in humans, but not in, eg, the rat and dog which are the preclinical species normally employed for safety assessment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["kidney", "liver", "metabolism", "metabolomics", "metabonomics", "paracetamol/acetaminophen"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084271234", "SubjectAreas": [["Toxicology", "PHAR", "3005"]], "AuthorData": {"57201069263": {"Name": "Dargue R.", "AuthorID": "57201069263", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Systems Medicine, Department of Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction, Imperial College London"}, "57147178700": {"Name": "Zia R.", "AuthorID": "57147178700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Systems Medicine, Department of Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction, Imperial College London"}, "57189464566": {"Name": "Lau C.", "AuthorID": "57189464566", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Systems Medicine, Department of Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction, Imperial College London"}, "7003439361": {"Name": "Coen M.", "AuthorID": "7003439361", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "Oncology Safety, Clinical Pharmacology and Safety Sciences, RandD, AstraZeneca"}, "57197374694": {"Name": "Wilson I.D.", "AuthorID": "57197374694", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Systems Medicine, Department of Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction, Imperial College London"}, "7103021970": {"Name": "Nicholls A.W.", "AuthorID": "7103021970", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "GSK RandD"}, "21740639500": {"Name": "Dare T.O.", "AuthorID": "21740639500", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "GSK RandD"}, "55949753800": {"Name": "Lee K.", "AuthorID": "55949753800", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Science and Services, Royal Veterinary College, University of London"}, "57211739627": {"Name": "Jalan R.", "AuthorID": "57211739627", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
