It is argued that schools are suitably positioned to provide support to bereaved children. However, there is a gap in research exploring bereavement support provision (BSP) in primary schools. This paper presents the qualitative phase of a mixed-methods study which aimed to gain insight into BSP in primary schools in one UK Local Authority. After completing an online questionnaire, 16 school staff took part in semi-structured interviews. The findings of this study highlighted that BSP is characterised by emotional support and other indirect responses. A key finding is that providing emotional support to a bereaved child has a negative impact on the emotional well-being of staff. This study discusses how educational psychologists (EPs) are well placed to provide whole school and targeted bereavement support to children and school staff.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Child bereavement", "emotional well-being", "grief", "loss", "primary school"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086830791", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"57217231769": {"Name": "Costelloe A.", "AuthorID": "57217231769", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Psychology and Development, Institute of Education University College London"}, "24466701200": {"Name": "Mintz J.", "AuthorID": "24466701200", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Psychology and Development, Institute of Education University College London"}, "57220840795": {"Name": "Lee F.", "AuthorID": "57220840795", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Psychology and Development, Institute of Education University College London"}}}
