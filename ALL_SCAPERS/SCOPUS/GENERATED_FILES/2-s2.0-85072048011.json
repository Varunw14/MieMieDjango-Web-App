All rights reserved.Background:Antiretroviral treatment (ART) reduces HIV infectiousness but the effect of early ART on sexual behaviour is unclear.Methods:We assessed, within the START randomized trial that enrolled HIV-positive adults with CD4+ cell count greater than 500cells/\u03bcl, the effect of early (immediate) versus deferred ART on: condomless sex with HIV-serodifferent partners (CLS-D); all condomless sex (CLS); HIV transmission-risk sex (CLS-D-HIV risk, defined as CLS-D and: not on ART or started ART <6 months ago or viral load greater than 200 copies/ml or no viral load in past 6 months), during 2-year follow-up. Month-12 CLS-D (2010-2014) was the primary outcome.Results:Among 2562 MSM, there was no difference between immediate and deferred arms in CLS-D at month 12 [12.6 versus 13.1%; difference (95% CI):-0.4% (-3.1 to 2.2%), P=0.75] or month 24, or in CLS. Among 2010 heterosexual men and women, CLS-D at month 12 tended to be higher in the immediate versus deferred arm [10.8 versus 8.3%; difference:2.5% (-0.1 to 5.2%), P=0.062]; the difference was greater at month 24 [9.3 versus 5.6%; difference: 3.7% (1.0 to 6.4%), P=0.007], at which time CLS was higher in the immediate arm (20.7 versus 15.7%, P=0.013). CLS-D-HIV risk at month 12 was substantially lower in the immediate versus deferred arm for MSM [0.2 versus 11%; difference:-10.7% (-12.5 to-8.9%), P<0.001] and heterosexuals [0.6% versus 7.7%; difference:-7.0% (-8.8 to-5.3%), P<0.001], because of viral suppression on ART.Conclusion:A strategy of early ART had no effect on condomless sex with HIV-serodifferent partners among MSM, but resulted in modestly higher prevalence among heterosexuals. However, among MSM and heterosexuals, early ART resulted in a substantial reduction in HIV-Transmission-risk sex, to a very low absolute level.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antiretroviral therapy", "Condomless sex", "Heterosexual", "HIV", "MSM", "Transmission"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anti-Retroviral Agents", "CD4 Lymphocyte Count", "Condoms", "Female", "Heterosexuality", "HIV Infections", "Homosexuality, Male", "Humans", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Risk-Taking", "Sex Factors", "Sexual and Gender Minorities", "Sexual Behavior", "United States", "Unsafe Sex"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072048011", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57027378700": {"Name": "Lampe F.C.", "AuthorID": "57027378700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "35944368900": {"Name": "Rodger A.J.", "AuthorID": "35944368900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "57202558738": {"Name": "Phillips A.N.", "AuthorID": "57202558738", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "7005482634": {"Name": "Burman W.", "AuthorID": "7005482634", "AffiliationID": "60018665, 60028392", "AffiliationName": "Denver Public Health, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center"}, "7005960643": {"Name": "Grulich A.", "AuthorID": "7005960643", "AffiliationID": "60026655, 60028333", "AffiliationName": "Kirby Institute, University of New South Wales"}, "57188785246": {"Name": "Emery S.", "AuthorID": "57188785246", "AffiliationID": "60026655, 60028333", "AffiliationName": "Kirby Institute, University of New South Wales"}, "35332007000": {"Name": "Friedland G.", "AuthorID": "35332007000", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Medicine and Epidemiology, Yale School of Medicine"}, "56275925300": {"Name": "Sadr W.E.", "AuthorID": "56275925300", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Columbia University"}, "7006720136": {"Name": "Neaton J.", "AuthorID": "7006720136", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "University of Minnesota"}, "57189661734": {"Name": "Corbelli G.M.", "AuthorID": "57189661734", "AffiliationID": "60139032", "AffiliationName": "European AIDS Treatment Group"}, "7201417014": {"Name": "Molina J.M.", "AuthorID": "7201417014", "AffiliationID": "60002900", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Paris, Department of Infectious Diseases, Hopital Saint-Louis"}, "16507203900": {"Name": "Orkin C.", "AuthorID": "16507203900", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University of London"}, "56622408100": {"Name": "Gatell J.", "AuthorID": "56622408100", "AffiliationID": "60001576", "AffiliationName": "University of Barcelona and Viiv Healthcare"}, "7005184715": {"Name": "Gerstoft J.", "AuthorID": "7005184715", "AffiliationID": "60015199", "AffiliationName": "Copenhagen University Hospital"}, "7004208798": {"Name": "Ruxrungtham K.", "AuthorID": "7004208798", "AffiliationID": "60028190", "AffiliationName": "Chulalongkorn University"}, "57192194055": {"Name": "Barbosa De Souza M.", "AuthorID": "57192194055", "AffiliationID": "60000036", "AffiliationName": "Universidade Federal Do Rio de Janeiro"}}}
