This paper describes the investigation of housing conditions in a low-income resettlement colony in Delhi. A novel transdisciplinary methodology to evaluate multiple housing health hazards and establish intervention priorities in participation with the community was developed. Findings from housing surveys and indoor environmental monitoring were contrasted with a participatory self-assessment\u2014revealing the widespread prevalence of hazards and suboptimal housing conditions as well as substantial differences in priorities, and thus perspectives, between participants and researchers. Focus group discussions explored the findings and built consensus on priorities. Our findings uncovered how poor housing conditions affect daily practices and thus are likely to adversely affect socio-economic development and gender equality. We highlight limitations in current frameworks to assess housing hazards and argue that a transdisciplinary approach is vital to provide a holistic understanding and to develop effective interventions. These insights are crucial to inform inclusive solutions for adequate housing and human settlements that can support improved health and help achieve the sustainable development goals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Community priorities", "Health hazards", "Housing", "Informal settlements", "Participatory approach"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085895158", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"56526881000": {"Name": "Nix E.", "AuthorID": "56526881000", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering, Bartlett School of Environment, Energy and Resources University, University College London"}, "57217031375": {"Name": "Paulose J.", "AuthorID": "57217031375", "AffiliationID": "124293604", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Urban and Regional Excellence"}, "55358884100": {"Name": "Shrubsole C.", "AuthorID": "55358884100", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Air Quality and Public Health Group, Environmental Hazards and Emergencies Department, Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards, Public Health England"}, "26533827300": {"Name": "Altamirano-Medina H.", "AuthorID": "26533827300", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering, Bartlett School of Environment, Energy and Resources University, University College London"}, "57202098246": {"Name": "Davies M.", "AuthorID": "57202098246", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering, Bartlett School of Environment, Energy and Resources University, University College London"}, "8656657000": {"Name": "Khosla R.", "AuthorID": "8656657000", "AffiliationID": "124293604", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Urban and Regional Excellence"}, "57194566008": {"Name": "Belesova K.", "AuthorID": "57194566008", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Centre on Climate Change and Planetary Health & Department of Public Health, Environments & Society, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}, "7201434649": {"Name": "Wilkinson P.", "AuthorID": "7201434649", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Centre on Climate Change and Planetary Health & Department of Public Health, Environments & Society, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}}}
