PCCs are well established for vitamin K antagonist reversal and their use in acquired coagulopathy unrelated to anticoagulants is limited in the context of perceived excess risk of thromboembolic events (TEEs). This review evaluates the advantages ('friend') and drawbacks ('foe') of PCC use in this setting, concentrating on cardiovascular surgery, trauma and liver disease. Typically, PCCs are used in patients with severe coagulopathy and multiple hemostatic abnormalities, and are preferred over fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for rapid or more complete coagulopathy correction, or where FFP is unsuitable. Studies show comparable efficacy with plasma, though patient and provider characteristics are a major confounder. Furthermore, mortality and TEE rates generally appear to reflect background incidence and TEE risk is determined by patient- and therapyrelated factors, in particular the PCC dose. Investigations to evaluate the risk-benefit profile of PCCs alone is urgently needed. Until then, PCCs should be administered judiciously using the minimum effective dose with ongoing risk-benefit analysis, as most TEEs tend to be nonfatal venous thrombotic events.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acquired coagulopathy", "Cardiovascular surgery", "Liver disease", "Prothrombin complex concentrates", "Thromboembolic events", "Trauma"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075026342", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57193134405": {"Name": "Chowdary P.", "AuthorID": "57193134405", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Katharine Dormandy Haemophilia and Thrombosis Centre, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57211790332": {"Name": "Peralta R.M.", "AuthorID": "57211790332", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Katharine Dormandy Haemophilia and Thrombosis Centre, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
