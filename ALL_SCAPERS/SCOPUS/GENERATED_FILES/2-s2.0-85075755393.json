The lack of compact, fast, and scalable simulations with network perturbations impedes the analysis of the vascular resilience to life-threatening conditions, surgical interventions and long-term follow-up. We introduce a graph-based approach for efficient simulations, which statistically estimates biomarkers from a series of perturbations on the patient-specific vascular network. Analog-equivalent circuits are derived from clinical angiographies. Vascular graphs embed mechanical attributes modelling the impedance of a tubular structure with stenosis, tortuosity and complete occlusions. We evaluate pressure and flow distributions, simulating healthy topologies and abnormal variants with perturbations in key pathological scenarios. These describe the intrinsic network resilience to pathology, and delineate the underlying cerebrovascular autoregulation mechanisms. Lastly, a putative graph sampling strategy is devised on the same formulation, to support the topological inference of uncertain neurovascular graphs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Efficient simulation", "Life threatening conditions", "Long-term follow-up", "Mechanical attributes", "Network resilience", "Surgical interventions", "Tubular structures", "Vascular complications"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075755393", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57204021789": {"Name": "Moriconi S.", "AuthorID": "57204021789", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "57204636980": {"Name": "Cardoso M.J.", "AuthorID": "57204636980", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "56811621300": {"Name": "Rehwald R.", "AuthorID": "56811621300", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "26642970600": {"Name": "J\u00e4ger H.R.", "AuthorID": "26642970600", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "6602253325": {"Name": "Nachev P.", "AuthorID": "6602253325", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "16551520500": {"Name": "Zuluaga M.A.", "AuthorID": "16551520500", "AffiliationID": "60055696", "AffiliationName": "Universidad Nacional de Colombia"}}}
