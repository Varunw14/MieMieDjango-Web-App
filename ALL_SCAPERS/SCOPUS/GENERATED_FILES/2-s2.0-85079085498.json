Supported by growing experimental evidence, the 'predictive coding' framework suggests that perception is driven by a mechanism of inference, based on an internal model of the signal source. However, a key element of this theory - the process through which the brain acquires this model, and its neural underpinnings - remains poorly understood. Here I review recent brain imaging and behavioural work which focuses on this missing link. Together these emerging results paint a picture of the brain as a regularity seeker, rapidly extracting and maintaining representations of acoustic structure on multiple time scales and even when these are not relevant to behaviour.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Auditory scene analysis", "Functional brain imaging", "MMN", "Predictive coding", "Surprise"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic structures", "Auditory Scene Analysis", "Experimental evidence", "Functional brain imaging", "Multiple time scale", "Predictive coding", "Sensory processing", "Surprise"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079085498", "SubjectAreas": [["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"]], "AuthorData": {"8953499500": {"Name": "Chait M.", "AuthorID": "8953499500", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Ear Institute, University College London"}}}
