The role of white matter connections has remained an open question for the past 250 years. Based on 1333 stroke lesions, here we reveal the human Disconnectome and demonstrate its relationship to the functional segregation of the human brain. Results indicate that functional territories are not only defined by white matter connections, but also by the highly stereotyped spatial distribution of brain disconnections. While the former has granted us the possibility to map 590 functions on the white matter of the whole brain, the latter compels a revision of the taxonomy of brain functions. Overall, our freely available Atlas of White Matter Function will enable improved clinical-neuroanatomical predictions for brain lesion studies and provide a platform for explorations in the domain of cognition.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Behavior", "Brain", "Connectome", "Humans", "Neuroimaging", "Stroke"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092272321", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56395490600": {"Name": "Thiebaut de Schotten M.", "AuthorID": "56395490600", "AffiliationID": "60102125, 60008134, 60007816, 60106793", "AffiliationName": "Groupe d\u2019Imagerie Neurofonctionnelle, Institut des Maladies Neurod\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ratives-UMR 5293, CNRS, CEA, University of Bordeaux"}, "57190280385": {"Name": "Foulon C.", "AuthorID": "57190280385", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, UCL"}, "6602253325": {"Name": "Nachev P.", "AuthorID": "6602253325", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, UCL"}}}
