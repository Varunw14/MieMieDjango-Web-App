This was evaluated by exposing Persian sturgeon to AgNPs in three salinities: freshwater (F: 0.4 ppt), brackish water 1 (B1: 6 \u00b1 0.2 ppt), and brackish water 2 (B2: 12 \u00b1 0.3 ppt) for 14 days, which was followed by analysis of alterations in plasma chemistry and histopathology of the gills, liver, and intestine. Values of 96-h median lethal concentration (LC50) were calculated as 0.89 mg/L in F, 2.07 mg/L in B1, and 1.59 mg/L in B2. After sub-chronic exposures, plasma cortisol, glucose, potassium, and sodium levels illustrated no significant changes within each salinity level. In F, 0.2 mg/L AgNP caused the highest levels of alkaline phosphatase and osmolality levels. In B1, 0.6 mg/L AgNP induced the highest level of alkaline phosphatase and elevated plasma osmolality was recorded in all AgNP-exposed treatments in comparison with the controls. The B2 treatment combined with 0.6 mg/L AgNP significantly reduced plasma chloride level. The results showed elevating salinity significantly increased osmolality, chloride, sodium, and potassium levels of plasma in the fish exposed to AgNPs. The abundance of the tissue lesions was AgNP concentration-dependent, where the highest number of damages was observed in the gills, followed by liver and intestine, respectively. The histopathological study also confirmed alterations such as degeneration of lamella, lifting of lamellar epithelium, hepatic vacuolation, pyknotic nuclei, and cellular infiltration of the lamina propria elicited by AgNPs in the gills, liver, and intestine of Persian sturgeon. In conclusion, the stability of AgNPs in aquatic environments can be regulated by changing the salinity, noting that AgNPs are more stable in low salinity waters.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Colloidal silver", "Gills", "Histopathology", "Metal nanoparticles", "Nanoecotoxicology", "Persian sturgeon"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Fishes", "Gills", "Metal Nanoparticles", "Salinity", "Silver"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078634065", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"], ["Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis", "ENVI", "2307"]], "AuthorData": {"35319802700": {"Name": "Banan A.", "AuthorID": "35319802700", "AffiliationID": "60026420", "AffiliationName": "Department of Animal Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Lorestan University"}, "14619235700": {"Name": "Kalbassi M.R.", "AuthorID": "14619235700", "AffiliationID": "60032053", "AffiliationName": "Department of Aquaculture, School of Marine Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University"}, "23396236000": {"Name": "Bahmani M.", "AuthorID": "23396236000", "AffiliationID": "110986015", "AffiliationName": "Iranian Fisheries Science and Research Institute"}, "36505048900": {"Name": "Sotoudeh E.", "AuthorID": "36505048900", "AffiliationID": "60012298", "AffiliationName": "Department of Fisheries, Faculty of Marine Science and Technology, Persian Gulf University"}, "35092663900": {"Name": "Johari S.A.", "AuthorID": "35092663900", "AffiliationID": "60001619", "AffiliationName": "Fisheries Department, Natural Resources Faculty, University of Kurdistan"}, "56485251500": {"Name": "Ali J.M.", "AuthorID": "56485251500", "AffiliationID": "123095403", "AffiliationName": "Permitting and Environmental Health Bureau, New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services"}, "6602852552": {"Name": "Kolok A.S.", "AuthorID": "6602852552", "AffiliationID": "60033389", "AffiliationName": "Idaho Water Resources Research Institute, University of Idaho"}}}
