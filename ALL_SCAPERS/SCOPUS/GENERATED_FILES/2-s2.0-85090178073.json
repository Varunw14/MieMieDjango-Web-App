An analysis of surveillance data from multiple sources to investigate the possible factors contributing to this decline in LGV was performed. Methods: LGV tests and diagnoses in the UK from 2004 to 2018 were captured through laboratory data from the LGV Reference Laboratories and laboratories conducting in-house LGV testing. These data and clinical diagnoses data from England were analysed alongside the national management guidelines issued over the course of the epidemic. Results: LGV diagnoses increased between 2004 and 2015 and then decreased between 2016 and 2018. LGV testing increased from 2010 to 2018 (2690-10 850). Test positivity halved between 2015 (14.8%, 929-6272) and 2018 (7.3%, 791-10 850). Peaks in LGV testing and diagnoses appeared to coincide with the publication of national LGV management guidelines and changes to clinical practice. The proportion of LGV diagnoses among HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) fell between 2013 and 2018 (74-48%). Conclusions: The fall in diagnoses and positivity were likely due to increasing earlier clinical diagnosis and treatment. Changes to the national management guidelines, the clinical policy and practice of some larger clinics and potentially changes to the guidelines for the treatment of chlamydia broadened the scope of testing and increased testing in asymptomatic patients which, in combination, likely had a positive effect on the control of LGV infection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["asymptomatic", "Chlamydia trachomatis", "LGV", "MSM", "sexually transmitted infections"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090178073", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57216734807": {"Name": "Allen H.", "AuthorID": "57216734807", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "55195870600": {"Name": "Pitt R.", "AuthorID": "55195870600", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "57216075036": {"Name": "Bardsley M.", "AuthorID": "57216075036", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "57201012868": {"Name": "Smolarchuk C.", "AuthorID": "57201012868", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "7202865115": {"Name": "Sullivan A.", "AuthorID": "7202865115", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "57197789900": {"Name": "Mohammed H.", "AuthorID": "57197789900", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "7401806224": {"Name": "Cole M.", "AuthorID": "7401806224", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "35110460800": {"Name": "Fifer H.", "AuthorID": "35110460800", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "57215827044": {"Name": "Hughes G.", "AuthorID": "57215827044", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "7003661858": {"Name": "Simms I.", "AuthorID": "7003661858", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "7202613754": {"Name": "Wallace L.", "AuthorID": "7202613754", "AffiliationID": "60111371", "AffiliationName": "Health Protection Scotland"}, "57213562915": {"Name": "Thomas D.", "AuthorID": "57213562915", "AffiliationID": "60111558", "AffiliationName": "Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre, Public Health Wales"}, "14015825400": {"Name": "Irvine N.", "AuthorID": "14015825400", "AffiliationID": "60138484", "AffiliationName": "Public Health Agency, Health and Social Care Northern Ireland"}, "6701845857": {"Name": "Templeton K.", "AuthorID": "6701845857", "AffiliationID": "60002975", "AffiliationName": "Scottish Bacterial Sexually Transmitted Infections Reference Laboratory, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"}}}
