This design-led study establishes videogames as an architectural medium through practice-based research projects, examining game worlds as architectural spaces by developing design methods to analyze their environments. It then discusses developing games as architectural representations combining virtual space with computational rules. The paper's final study suggests how game structures might be applied in design approaches for ostensibly real sites. Through four case study projects, I outline a new form of architectural design practice operating between physical and virtual, reflecting the cultural influence of game worlds and exploring videogame environments as new ways to \u2018realise\u2019 architecture.", "AuthorKeywords": ["architectural design", "case studies", "conceptual design", "design methods", "videogame design"], "IndexKeywords": ["Architectural representation", "Architectural space", "Case-studies", "Computational rules", "Cultural influences", "Design approaches", "Design method", "Practice-based research"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077376822", "SubjectAreas": [["Architecture", "ENGI", "2216"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"37084077300": {"Name": "Pearson L.C.", "AuthorID": "37084077300", "AffiliationID": "60085003, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Architecture, University College London"}}}
