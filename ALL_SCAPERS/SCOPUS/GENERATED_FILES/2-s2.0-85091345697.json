Insect Conservation and Diversity published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Royal Entomological Society.Declines in pollinating invertebrates across intensively cultivated landscapes linked to reductions in flower-rich habitats constitute a key threat to biodiversity conservation and the provision of ecosystem services. Over recent decades, many ponds in agricultural landscapes have become overgrown with woody vegetation, resulting in heavily shaded, flower-poor pond basins and margins. Restoration of farmland ponds through removal of sediment and encroaching woody vegetation (canopy management) from pond margins greatly enhances freshwater biodiversity. Nevertheless, the consequences of pond management for pond-margin plants and pollinating insects remain poorly understood. Here, we studied these effects for ponds in Norfolk, eastern England. We compared richness, abundance and composition of pollinating insects (hymenopterans and syrphids) and insect-pollinated plant communities between open-canopy pond systems subjected to either (i) long-term regular management of woody vegetation or (ii) recent restoration by woody vegetation and sediment removal with those communities at (iii) ponds dominated by woody vegetation. Canopy management increased the richness and abundance of pollinators and insect-pollinated plants. Pollinator richness and abundance was best explained by improvements in flower resources at open-canopy ponds. Management most strongly influenced hymenopteran communities. Ponds represent important semi-natural habitats for insect-pollinated plant and pollinator communities in farmland. To enhance food resources, diversity and abundance of diurnal pollinators, conservation management at ponds should aim for mosaics of ponds at different successional stages with a high proportion of early successional open-canopy ponds. Agricultural ponds are emerging as important habitats not only for aquatic biodiversity, but also for terrestrial species, thus warranting their prioritisation in future agri-environment schemes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biodiversity conservation", "farmland ponds", "habitat heterogeneity", "pollinator community", "pollinator diversity", "semi-natural habitats"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091345697", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Insect Science", "AGRI", "1109"]], "AuthorData": {"57216762399": {"Name": "Walton R.E.", "AuthorID": "57216762399", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60109029", "AffiliationName": "Pond Restoration Research Group, Environmental Change Research Centre, Department of Geography, Pearson Building, University College London"}, "7003314493": {"Name": "Sayer C.D.", "AuthorID": "7003314493", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60109029", "AffiliationName": "Pond Restoration Research Group, Environmental Change Research Centre, Department of Geography, Pearson Building, University College London"}, "6701746027": {"Name": "Bennion H.", "AuthorID": "6701746027", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60109029", "AffiliationName": "Pond Restoration Research Group, Environmental Change Research Centre, Department of Geography, Pearson Building, University College London"}, "15062311900": {"Name": "Axmacher J.C.", "AuthorID": "15062311900", "AffiliationID": "60071145", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Environmental and Forest Sciences, Agricultural University of Iceland"}}}
