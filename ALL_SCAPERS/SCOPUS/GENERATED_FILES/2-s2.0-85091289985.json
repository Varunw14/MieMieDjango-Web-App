Comorbid sleep disorders are common in patients with SRE and can exert a negative impact on seizure control and quality of life. Purposes: To define the standard procedures for the diagnostic pathway of patients with possible SRE (scenario 1) and the general management of patients with SRE and comorbidity with sleep disorders (scenario 2). Methods: The project was conducted under the auspices of the European Academy of Neurology (EAN), the European Sleep Research Society (ESRS) and the International League against Epilepsy (ILAE) Europe. The framework of the document entailed the following phases: conception of the clinical scenarios; literature review; statements regarding the standard procedures. For literature search a step-wise approach starting from systematic reviews to primary studies was applied. Published studies were identified from the National Library of Medicine\u2019s MEDLINE database and Cochrane Library. Results: Scenario 1: despite a low quality of evidence, recommendations on anamnestic evaluation, tools for capturing the event at home or in the laboratory are provided for specific SRE. Scenario 2: Early diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders (especially respiratory disorders) in patients with SRE are likely to be beneficial for seizures control. Conclusions: Definitive procedures for evaluating patients with SRE are lacking. We provide advice that could be of help for standardising and improving the diagnostic approach of specific SRE. The importance of identifying and treating specific sleep disorders for the management and outcome of patients with SRE is underlined.", "AuthorKeywords": ["epilepsy", "insomnia", "polysomnography", "restless legs syndrome", "sleep apnea", "sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091289985", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"7006123448": {"Name": "Nobili L.", "AuthorID": "7006123448", "AffiliationID": "60025153", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience \u2013 Rehabilitation\u2013Ophthalmology \u2013 Genetics \u2013 Child and Maternal Health (DINOGMI), University of Genoa"}, "35369803800": {"Name": "de Weerd A.", "AuthorID": "35369803800", "AffiliationID": "60027759", "AffiliationName": "Stichting Epilepsie Instellingen Nederland"}, "57219220286": {"Name": "Rubboli G.", "AuthorID": "57219220286", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "University of Copenhagen"}, "7801623846": {"Name": "Beniczky S.", "AuthorID": "7801623846", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University"}, "35966320000": {"Name": "Derry C.", "AuthorID": "35966320000", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences and Sleep Medicine, Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, The University of Edinburgh"}, "7202286719": {"Name": "Eriksson S.", "AuthorID": "7202286719", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60019953, 60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery and Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7005309377": {"Name": "Halasz P.", "AuthorID": "7005309377", "AffiliationID": "118403247", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Clinical Neuroscience"}, "57024774200": {"Name": "H\u00f6gl B.", "AuthorID": "57024774200", "AffiliationID": "60008222", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Medical University of Innsbruck"}, "7202364451": {"Name": "Santamaria J.", "AuthorID": "7202364451", "AffiliationID": "60030315", "AffiliationName": "Multidisciplinary Sleep Unit, Neurology Service, Hospital Cl\u00ednic"}, "6506124484": {"Name": "Khatami R.", "AuthorID": "6506124484", "AffiliationID": "125143460", "AffiliationName": "Barmelweid Academy, Center of Sleep Medicine, Sleep Research and Epilepsy, Klinik Barmelweid"}, "7004135382": {"Name": "Ryvlin P.", "AuthorID": "7004135382", "AffiliationID": "60023561, 60000239", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV) and University of Lausanne"}, "6603017948": {"Name": "R\u00e9mi J.", "AuthorID": "6603017948", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Epilepsy Center, Department of Neurology, University of Munich Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians-University"}, "57209750981": {"Name": "Tinuper P.", "AuthorID": "57209750981", "AffiliationID": "60104781, 60013263", "AffiliationName": "IRCCS Istituto delle Scienze Neurologiche di Bologna, Ospedale Bellaria"}, "6602944238": {"Name": "Vignatelli L.", "AuthorID": "6602944238", "AffiliationID": "60104781, 60013263", "AffiliationName": "IRCCS Istituto delle Scienze Neurologiche di Bologna, Ospedale Bellaria"}, "7005005214": {"Name": "Bassetti C.", "AuthorID": "7005005214", "AffiliationID": "60010188", "AffiliationName": "Neurology Department, Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University"}, "7005996759": {"Name": "Manni R.", "AuthorID": "7005996759", "AffiliationID": "60083543", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Sleep Medicine and Epilepsy, IRCCS Mondino Foundation"}, "57194847877": {"Name": "Koutroumanidis M.", "AuthorID": "57194847877", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
