Topography affects visibility and therefore the spatial awareness of pedestrians. It also accentuates the role of physical effort during travel and route selection. The existing models fall short in their reference to these issues. A thorough description of the proposed model is followed by a validation - the model was tested against two existing models in three case studies in Haifa and Jerusalem, Israel. The proposed model outperformed the others in the steeper parts of the case studies. Future model development is discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079353532", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"57196034555": {"Name": "Greenberg E.", "AuthorID": "57196034555", "AffiliationID": "60022403", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Architecture and Town Planning, Technion IIT"}, "6507848525": {"Name": "Fisher-Gewirtzman D.", "AuthorID": "6507848525", "AffiliationID": "60022403", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Architecture and Town Planning, Technion IIT"}, "55916324100": {"Name": "Natapov A.", "AuthorID": "55916324100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College London"}}}
