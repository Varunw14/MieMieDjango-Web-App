The main focus is on systems where the chemical and physical configuration of the molecule-surface interaction is determined with atomic-scale precision. A discussion of the practical aspects of surface preparation and functionalisation under ultrahigh vacuum conditions is presented first, followed by a discussion of some important examples from the literature.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adsorption", "Desorption", "Functionalisation", "Molecular", "Organic", "Passivation", "Scanning tunnelling microscopy", "Semiconductor", "Surface", "Ultra-high vacuum", "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079259465", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"7006018442": {"Name": "Schofield S.R.", "AuthorID": "7006018442", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
