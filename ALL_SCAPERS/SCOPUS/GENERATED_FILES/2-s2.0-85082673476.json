Published by Cambridge University Press.This article excavates the imperial origins behind the recent turn towards digital biometrics in Kenya. It also tells the story of an important moment of race-making in the years after the Second World War. Though Kenya may be considered a frontier market for today's biometrics industry, fingerprinting was first introduced in the early twentieth century. By 1920, the Kenyan colonial government had dictated that African men who left their reserves be fingerprinted and issued an identity card (known colloquially as a kipande). In the late 1940s, after decades of African protest, the colonial government replaced the kipande with a universal system of registration via fingerprinting. This legislative move was accompanied by protests from members of the white settler community. Ironically, the effort to deracialize Kenya's identification regime only further normalized the use of biometrics, but also failed to fully undermine associations between white male exceptionalism and exemption from fingerprinting.", "AuthorKeywords": ["colonial administration", "East Africa", "identity", "Kenya", "race", "technology", "white settlement"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082673476", "SubjectAreas": [["History", "ARTS", "1202"]], "AuthorData": {"56034993400": {"Name": "Weitzberg K.E.R.E.N.", "AuthorID": "56034993400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Advanced Studies, University College"}}}
