Experiments are performed in a broad temperature and frequency ranges allowing us to probe several dipolar relaxations. For both samples at temperature below 220 K, we observe confined supercooled water dynamics, which can be described by the Arrhenius law. At slightly higher temperature, a second less pronounced dipolar relaxation is identified, and its origin is discussed. At even higher temperature, the dielectric permittivity exhibits anomalous increase with increasing temperature due to the proton conductivity. Upon further heating, the permittivity shows a sudden decrease indicating a reversible removal of water molecules. Measurements of the dehydrated samples reveal absence of all three dipolar processes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dielectric spectroscopy", "Metal-organic framework", "UiO-66", "Water dynamics"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083803773", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Chemistry (miscellaneous)", "CHEM", "1601"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"56755340700": {"Name": "Bal\u010di\u016bnas S.", "AuthorID": "56755340700", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Physics, Vilnius University"}, "57205404761": {"Name": "Pavlovaite D.", "AuthorID": "57205404761", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Physics, Vilnius University"}, "8948765300": {"Name": "Kinka M.", "AuthorID": "8948765300", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Physics, Vilnius University"}, "55865561500": {"Name": "\u0160imenas M.", "AuthorID": "55865561500", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Physics, Vilnius University"}, "55903114400": {"Name": "Grigalaitis R.", "AuthorID": "55903114400", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Physics, Vilnius University"}, "7003687871": {"Name": "Banys J.", "AuthorID": "7003687871", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Physics, Vilnius University"}, "57208333848": {"Name": "Yeh J.Y.", "AuthorID": "57208333848", "AffiliationID": "60005429", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, National Taiwan University"}, "57211915575": {"Name": "Han P.C.", "AuthorID": "57211915575", "AffiliationID": "60005429", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, National Taiwan University"}, "57219637569": {"Name": "Wu K.C.W.", "AuthorID": "57219637569", "AffiliationID": "60005429", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, National Taiwan University"}, "14123951400": {"Name": "Shieh F.K.", "AuthorID": "14123951400", "AffiliationID": "60024666", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, National Central University"}}}
