The achievable sum rate is investigated for two precoding techniques, namely: 1) zero forcing (ZF) precoding, 2) constructive interference (CI) precoding. In light of this, new analytical expressions for the average sum rate are derived in the two scenarios, and Monte Carlo simulations are provided throughout to confirm the analysis. Furthermore, based on the derived expressions, a power allocation scheme that can ensure fairness among the users is also investigated. The results in this paper demonstrate that, the CI strictly outperforms the ZF scheme, and the performance gap between the considered schemes depends essentially on the system parameters.", "AuthorKeywords": ["constructive interference", "Finite constellation signaling", "multiple-input multiple-output", "zero forcing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Achievable sum rates", "Analytical expressions", "Average sum rates", "Constructive interference", "Multiuser multiple input multiple outputs (MU-MIMO)", "Performance gaps", "Power allocations", "Zero-forcing"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074791732", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"57044158800": {"Name": "Salem A.", "AuthorID": "57044158800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "23009493900": {"Name": "Masouros C.", "AuthorID": "23009493900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
