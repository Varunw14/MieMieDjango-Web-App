Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of the Royal College of Psychiatrists.This study explored patterns of abuse, self-harm and thoughts of suicide/self-harm in the UK during the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic using data from the COVID-19 Social Study (n=44 775), a non-probability sample weighted to population proportions. The reported frequency of abuse, self-harm and thoughts of suicide/self-harm was higher among women, Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups and people experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage, unemployment, disability, chronic physical illnesses, mental disorders and COVID-19 diagnosis. Psychiatric medications were the most common type of support being used, but fewer than half of those affected were accessing formal or informal support.", "AuthorKeywords": ["abuse", "COVID-19", "mental health", "self-harm", "thoughts of suicide or self-harm"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Betacoronavirus", "Coronavirus Infections", "Domestic Violence", "Female", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Mental Health Services", "Middle Aged", "Pandemics", "Pneumonia, Viral", "Prevalence", "Psychosocial Support Systems", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Self-Injurious Behavior", "Social Isolation", "Suicidal Ideation", "Suicide", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091438777", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57202544833": {"Name": "Iob E.", "AuthorID": "57202544833", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College"}, "7102289942": {"Name": "Steptoe A.", "AuthorID": "7102289942", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College"}, "55911947100": {"Name": "Fancourt D.", "AuthorID": "55911947100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College"}}}
