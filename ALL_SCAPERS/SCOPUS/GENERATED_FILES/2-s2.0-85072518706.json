Medical therapy aims for mucosal healing and is achievable with biologics, immunosuppressive therapy, and specialised enteral nutrition, but not with corticosteroids. Sustained remission remains a therapeutic challenge. Enteral nutrition, containing macro- and micro-nutrients, is nutritionally complete, and is provided in powder or liquid form. Enteral nutrition is a low-risk and minimally invasive therapy. It is well-established and recommended as first line induction therapy in paediatric Crohn\u2019s disease with remission rates of up to 80%. Other than in Japan, enteral nutrition is not routinely used in the adult population among Western countries, mainly due to unpalatable formulations which lead to poor compliance. This study aims to offer a comprehensive review of available enteral nutrition formulations and the literature supporting the use and mechanisms of action of enteral nutrition in adult Crohn\u2019s disease patients, in order to support clinicians in real world decision-making when offering/accepting treatment. The mechanisms of actions of enteral feed, including their impact on the gut microbiome, were explored. Barriers to the use of enteral nutrition, such as compliance and the route of administration, were considered. All available enteral preparations have been comprehensively described as a practical guide for clinical use. Likewise, guidelines are reported and discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Crohn\u2019s disease", "Enteral nutrition", "Exclusive enteral nutrition", "Partial enteral nutrition"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Crohn Disease", "Enteral Nutrition", "Food, Formulated", "Humans"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072518706", "SubjectAreas": [["Food Science", "AGRI", "1106"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"6602354517": {"Name": "Di Caro S.", "AuthorID": "6602354517", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Intestinal Failure Service, GI Services, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56115678000": {"Name": "Fragkos K.C.", "AuthorID": "56115678000", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Intestinal Failure Service, GI Services, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55366728500": {"Name": "Sebepos-Rogers G.", "AuthorID": "55366728500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Intestinal Failure Service, GI Services, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57148597500": {"Name": "Saravanapavan H.", "AuthorID": "57148597500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Intestinal Failure Service, GI Services, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57205279533": {"Name": "Barragry J.", "AuthorID": "57205279533", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Intestinal Failure Service, GI Services, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57211062270": {"Name": "Rogers J.", "AuthorID": "57211062270", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Intestinal Failure Service, GI Services, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56402425500": {"Name": "Mehta S.J.", "AuthorID": "56402425500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Intestinal Failure Service, GI Services, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "12647293500": {"Name": "Rahman F.", "AuthorID": "12647293500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Intestinal Failure Service, GI Services, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57197771575": {"Name": "Keetarut K.", "AuthorID": "57197771575", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dietetics, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57211060679": {"Name": "Koo H.F.", "AuthorID": "57211060679", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "UCL Medical School"}}}
