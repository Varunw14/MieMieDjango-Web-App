It elaborates on the notion of \u201cstate assemblage\u201d to consider how the power of the state (in this case, both the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong authorities) manifests in CBS and, in particular, how the state attempts to exert control over children's and parents' bodies. This view of CBS contrasts with a sense of \u201cagency\u201d that prevails around discussions of educational mobilities, and we explore this tension here. The paper focuses on two related aspects of CBS\u2014materiality and the role of habit and rhythm in directing, guiding, and cajoling children to conform to an extremely rigid and regimented daily routine. We found that the material structures that make up the border are crucial in enabling CBS to \u201cfunction\u201d and that notions of rhythm and habit are very useful for understanding how the \u201cflow\u201d of educational mobilities is achieved. At the same time, we considered instances where flow was disrupted, rhythms were changed, and individuals somehow resisted the material constraints of the border.", "AuthorKeywords": ["children", "cross-boundary schooling", "Hong Kong", "mobilities", "Shenzhen"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076434843", "SubjectAreas": [["Demography", "SOCI", "3317"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"]], "AuthorData": {"10041492900": {"Name": "Waters J.L.", "AuthorID": "10041492900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}, "53064107500": {"Name": "Leung M.W.H.", "AuthorID": "53064107500", "AffiliationID": "60007989", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Geography and Spatial Planning, Utrecht University"}}}
