As part of the key actions of the European Green Deal, increased building renovations, a `renovation wave', is needed to ensure that the ambitious EU energy saving and decarbonisation goals can be reached by 2030 and 2050, accordingly. To incentivise renovation further, integrating energy retrofitting with seismic strengthening is explored in this study. A combined energy and seismic retrofitting is investigated across twenty European cities with varied seismic hazard levels and different climatic conditions. Typical building types are defined both in terms of their energy and structural characteristics and are associated to the building population of each city. A monetary metric for combined assessments based on expected annual losses from energy costs and seismic losses is used and an optimum retrofitting scenario is identified. By means of the proposed renovation rate of 3%, a reduction of approximately 30% of primary energy use and CO2 emissions may be achieved within a decade. Taking into account energy costs and costs related to structural damage it is found that a combined retrofitting scheme will reduce substantially the payback periods in moderate to high seismicity regions. In such locations the combined energy and seismic retrofitting is justified and proposed instead of the sole energy retrofitting typically applied today in existing buildings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Building energy modelling", "Combined seismic and energy retrofit", "Existing building stock", "Foresight studies", "Renovation strategies", "The European Green Deal"], "IndexKeywords": ["Building population", "Building renovation", "Climatic conditions", "Existing residential buildings", "Expected annual loss", "Seismic retrofitting", "Seismic strengthening", "Structural characteristics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084966720", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56801846100": {"Name": "Pohoryles D.A.", "AuthorID": "56801846100", "AffiliationID": "60103695", "AffiliationName": "European Commission, Joint Research Centre (JRC)"}, "22953240400": {"Name": "Bournas D.A.", "AuthorID": "22953240400", "AffiliationID": "60103695", "AffiliationName": "European Commission, Joint Research Centre (JRC)"}, "42261935500": {"Name": "Kouris L.A.", "AuthorID": "42261935500", "AffiliationID": "60103695", "AffiliationName": "European Commission, Joint Research Centre (JRC)"}, "56960489400": {"Name": "Maduta C.", "AuthorID": "56960489400", "AffiliationID": "60001317", "AffiliationName": "Politehnica University Timisoara"}}}
