Using a custom-developed needle probe with a sapphire ball lens, we measure polarized Raman spectra of cartilage. By imaging two polarizations simultaneously on the charge-coupled device (CCD) and binning them separately, we capture both biochemical and structural tissue information in real time. Here, we demonstrate that polarized Raman spectroscopy can distinguish between different collagen fibril alignment orientations in a cartilage explant model system, supporting its capacity for diagnosing the hallmark collagen alignment changes occurring in the early stages of osteoarthritis (OA). Accordingly, this work shows that needle-based polarized Raman spectroscopy has great potential for the monitoring and diagnosis of early OA.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Articular cartilages", "Cartilage explants", "Collagen fibrils", "Model system", "Monitoring and diagnosis", "Needle probes", "Polarized Raman spectra", "Polarized raman spectroscopy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084656349", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57216782166": {"Name": "Jensen M.", "AuthorID": "57216782166", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Craniofacial and Regenerative Biology, King\u2019s College London"}, "56392653500": {"Name": "Horgan C.C.", "AuthorID": "56392653500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Craniofacial and Regenerative Biology, King\u2019s College London"}, "36058363700": {"Name": "Bergholt M.S.", "AuthorID": "36058363700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Craniofacial and Regenerative Biology, King\u2019s College London"}, "23010613000": {"Name": "Vercauteren T.", "AuthorID": "23010613000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "13409684700": {"Name": "Albro M.B.", "AuthorID": "13409684700", "AffiliationID": "60019674", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Boston University"}}}
