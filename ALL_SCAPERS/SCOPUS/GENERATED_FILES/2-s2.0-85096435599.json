Whether there is a direct association between the cervicovaginal microbiome and the host\u2019s epigenome is largely unexplored. Results: Here we analyzed a total of 448 cervicovaginal smear samples and studied both the DNA methylome of the host and the microbiome using the Illumina EPIC array and next-generation sequencing, respectively. We found that those CpGs that are hypo-methylated in samples with non-lactobacilli (O-type) dominating communities are strongly associated with gastrointestinal differentiation and that a signature consisting of 819 CpGs was able to discriminate lactobacilli-dominating (L-type) from O-type samples with an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.84 (95% CI = 0.77\u20130.90) in an independent validation set. The performance found in samples with more than 50% epithelial cells was further improved (AUC 0.87) and in women younger than 50 years of age was even higher (AUC 0.91). In a subset of 96 women, the buccal but not the blood cell DNA showed the same trend as the cervicovaginal samples in discriminating women with L- from O-type cervicovaginal communities. Conclusions: These findings strongly support the view that the epithelial epigenome plays an essential role in hosting specific microbial communities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cervicovaginal microbiome", "DNA methylation", "Epigenome\u2013microbiome interaction", "Penalized regression"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096435599", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"55083650600": {"Name": "Nen\u00e9 N.R.", "AuthorID": "55083650600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "57221026825": {"Name": "Barrett J.", "AuthorID": "57221026825", "AffiliationID": "60009999", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute for Biomedical Aging Research, Universit\u00e4t Innsbruck"}, "57207018800": {"Name": "Jones A.", "AuthorID": "57207018800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women\u2019s Cancer, EGA Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "8848841800": {"Name": "Evans I.", "AuthorID": "8848841800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women\u2019s Cancer, EGA Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "6507446265": {"Name": "Reisel D.", "AuthorID": "6507446265", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women\u2019s Cancer, EGA Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "7004011904": {"Name": "Timms J.F.", "AuthorID": "7004011904", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women\u2019s Cancer, EGA Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "7006520678": {"Name": "Widschwendter M.", "AuthorID": "7006520678", "AffiliationID": "60009999", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute for Biomedical Aging Research, Universit\u00e4t Innsbruck"}, "35590491800": {"Name": "Paprotka T.", "AuthorID": "35590491800", "AffiliationID": "122928848", "AffiliationName": "Eurofins Genomics Europe Sequencing"}, "57220065710": {"Name": "Leimbach A.", "AuthorID": "57220065710", "AffiliationID": "122928848", "AffiliationName": "Eurofins Genomics Europe Sequencing"}, "7003801611": {"Name": "Franchi D.", "AuthorID": "7003801611", "AffiliationID": "100643808", "AffiliationName": "Europeo Di Oncologia, IRCCS"}, "57219383787": {"Name": "Colombo N.", "AuthorID": "57219383787", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "University of Milano-Bicocca"}, "57195297744": {"Name": "Bj\u00f8rge L.", "AuthorID": "57195297744", "AffiliationID": "60029622", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cancer Biomarkers, Department of Clinical Science, CCBIO, University of Bergen"}, "6507167275": {"Name": "Zikan M.", "AuthorID": "6507167275", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, General University Hospital in Prague, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University"}, "7006225985": {"Name": "Cibula D.", "AuthorID": "7006225985", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, General University Hospital in Prague, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University"}}}
