METHODS The authors performed a retrospective review of consecutive brain biopsies at a tertiary pediatric neurosciences unit between 1997 and 2017. Children < 18 years undergoing biopsy for neurological pathology were included. Those with presumed neoplasms and biopsy performed in the context of epilepsy surgery were excluded. RESULTS Forty-nine biopsies in 47 patients (25 females, mean age \u00b1 SD 9.0 \u00b1 5.3 years) were performed during the study period. The most common presenting symptoms were focal neurological deficit (28.6%) and focal seizure (26.5%). Histopathological, microbiological, and genetic analyses of biopsy material were contributory to the diagnosis in 34 cases (69.4%). Children presenting with focal seizures or with diffuse (> 3 lesions) brain involvement on MRI were more likely to yield a diagnosis at biopsy (OR 3.07 and 2.4, respectively). Twelve patients were immunocompromised and were more likely to yield a diagnosis at biopsy (OR 6.7). Surgery was accompanied by severe complications in 1 patient. The most common final diagnoses were infective (16/49, 32.7%), followed by chronic inflammatory processes (10/49, 20.4%) and occult neoplastic disease (9/49, 18.4%). In 38 cases (77.6%), biopsy was considered to have altered clinical management. CONCLUSIONS Brain biopsy for cryptogenic neurological disease in children was contributory to the diagnosis in 69.4% of cases and changed clinical management in 77.6%. Biopsy most commonly revealed underlying infective processes, chronic inflammatory changes, or occult neoplastic disease. Although generally safe, the risk of severe complications may be higher in immunocompromised and myelosuppressed children.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Astrovirus", "Brain biopsy", "Cryptogenic neurological disease", "EBV encephalitis", "Neurosurgery", "Pediatrics", "Surgical technique"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091148294", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57216777271": {"Name": "Horsfall H.L.", "AuthorID": "57216777271", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60017488", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurosurgery, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Addenbrooke's Hospital, University of Cambridge"}, "55892641800": {"Name": "Toescu S.M.", "AuthorID": "55892641800", "AffiliationID": "115777484", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Imaging and Biophysics Section"}, "57219324588": {"Name": "Grover P.J.", "AuthorID": "57219324588", "AffiliationID": "115514896", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Neurosurgery"}, "56255711900": {"Name": "Aquilina K.", "AuthorID": "56255711900", "AffiliationID": "115514896", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Neurosurgery"}, "57218691709": {"Name": "Hassell J.", "AuthorID": "57218691709", "AffiliationID": "114595163", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Neurology"}, "57220393295": {"Name": "Sayer C.", "AuthorID": "57220393295", "AffiliationID": "114595163", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Neurology"}, "35388344100": {"Name": "Hemingway C.", "AuthorID": "35388344100", "AffiliationID": "114595163", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Neurology"}, "7102046467": {"Name": "Harding B.", "AuthorID": "7102046467", "AffiliationID": "60030118", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"}, "7003519864": {"Name": "Jacques T.S.", "AuthorID": "7003519864", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer Department, UCL GOS Institute of Child Health"}}}
