However, CKA fundamentally misses tests, which are needed to model standard programming constructs such as conditionals and while-loops. It turns out that integrating tests in CKA is subtle, due to their interaction with parallelism. In this paper we provide a solution in the form of Concurrent Kleene Algebra with Observations (CKAO). Our main contribution is a completeness theorem for CKAO. Our result resorts on a more general study of CKA \u201cwith hypotheses\u201d, of which CKAO turns out to be an instance: this analysis is of independent interest, as it can be applied to extensions of CKA other than CKAO.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Completeness theorems", "Concurrent program", "Kleene algebras", "Parallel composition operators", "While loops"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084111382", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57114668000": {"Name": "Kapp\u00e9 T.", "AuthorID": "57114668000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56189147600": {"Name": "Brunet P.", "AuthorID": "56189147600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "23398564400": {"Name": "Silva A.", "AuthorID": "23398564400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57204501183": {"Name": "Wagemaker J.", "AuthorID": "57204501183", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6507161816": {"Name": "Zanasi F.", "AuthorID": "6507161816", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
