Previously, we sketched how the prevailing concepts and measurement practices employed in research and speech pathology practice for communication disorders have framed the real-time accomplishment of co-present communication, and contrasted them with its observable properties. We also proposed that distinctive aspects of communication disorders could be divided into three conceptual/causal frames: microgenetic, synchronic, and enchronic. The enchronic frame aligns with the real-time accomplishment of communication, capturing the ways that cognitive processing and language systems are actually put to use for communication. In this special issue, the contributors explore a core aspect of communication\u2013repair organization\u2013in interactions involving people with communication disorders. Each contribution provides detailed insight into population-specific ways that other-participation in repair (and associated activities) shapes communication in daily life.", "AuthorKeywords": ["communication disorders", "Conversation analysis", "language assessment", "repair"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087909203", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"35279376600": {"Name": "Barnes S.", "AuthorID": "35279376600", "AffiliationID": "60019544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Linguistics, Macquarie University"}, "15030938100": {"Name": "Bloch S.", "AuthorID": "15030938100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Language and Cognition, University College London"}}}
