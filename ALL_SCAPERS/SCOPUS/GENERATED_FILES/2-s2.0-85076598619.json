This equation takes into account the third order dispersion, self-frequency shift and self-steepening effects, thus making it closer to realistic physical applications. These effects are important both for water waves and pulses in optical fibres. Although the Sasa\u2013Satsuma equation is integrable, the degree of complexity of these new solutions has prevented them being found previously. Here, we present in explicit form the second-order rogue wave solutions of the Sasa\u2013Satsuma equation for three free parameter values of the family of rogue wave solutions. Special choices of the free parameters allow us to present these solutions in the simplest possible way and to illustrate them graphically.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Darboux transformation", "Sasa\u2013Satsuma equation", "Second-order rogue waves"], "IndexKeywords": ["Complicated structures", "Darboux transformations", "Degree of complexity", "Physical application", "Rogue waves", "Self steepening effect", "Self-frequency shift", "Third order dispersion"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076598619", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Mathematical Physics", "MATH", "2610"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"35183693700": {"Name": "Mu G.", "AuthorID": "35183693700", "AffiliationID": "60009860", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics and Key Laboratory for Nonlinear Mathematical Models and Methods, Fudan University"}, "7202822682": {"Name": "Qin Z.", "AuthorID": "7202822682", "AffiliationID": "60009860", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics and Key Laboratory for Nonlinear Mathematical Models and Methods, Fudan University"}, "35462748600": {"Name": "Grimshaw R.", "AuthorID": "35462748600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "7004817995": {"Name": "Akhmediev N.", "AuthorID": "7004817995", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "Optical Sciences Group, Department of Theoretical Physics, Research School of Physics and Engineering, the Australian National University, Canberra"}}}
