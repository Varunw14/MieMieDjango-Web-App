Rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque within a coronary artery can result in an acute myocardial infarction, which is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Prompt reperfusion can salvage some of the ischaemic territory, but ischaemia and reperfusion (IR) still causes substantial injury and is, therefore, a therapeutic target for further infarct limitation. Numerous cardioprotective strategies have been identified that can limit IR injury in animal models, but none have yet been translated effectively to patients. This disconnect prompts an urgent re-examination of the experimental models used to study IR. Since coronary atherosclerosis is the most prevalent morbidity in this patient population, and impairs coronary vessel function, it is potentially a major confounder in cardioprotective studies. Surprisingly, most studies suggest that atherosclerosis does not have a major impact on cardioprotection in mouse models. However, a major limitation of atherosclerotic animal models is that the plaques usually manifest in the aorta and proximal great vessels, and rarely in the coronary vessels. In this review, we examine the commonly used mouse models of atherosclerosis and their effect on coronary artery function and infarct size. We conclude that none of the commonly used strains of mice are ideal for this purpose; however, more recently developed mouse models of atherosclerosis fulfil the requirement for coronary artery lesions, plaque rupture and lipoprotein patterns resembling the human profile, and may enable the identification of therapeutic interventions more applicable in the clinical setting.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atherosclerosis", "Cardioprotection", "Coronary artery", "Ischaemia", "Mice", "Myocardial infarction", "Reperfusion", "Vascular function"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096893743", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"57207135224": {"Name": "Golforoush P.", "AuthorID": "57207135224", "AffiliationID": "112841168", "AffiliationName": "The Hatter Cardiovascular Institute"}, "7103223278": {"Name": "Yellon D.M.", "AuthorID": "7103223278", "AffiliationID": "112841168", "AffiliationName": "The Hatter Cardiovascular Institute"}, "10139785100": {"Name": "Davidson S.M.", "AuthorID": "10139785100", "AffiliationID": "112841168", "AffiliationName": "The Hatter Cardiovascular Institute"}}}
