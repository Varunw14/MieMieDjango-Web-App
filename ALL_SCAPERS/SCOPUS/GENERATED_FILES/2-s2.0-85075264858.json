The current study examines associations between slow gait speed and transitions between cognitive states and death in later life. Methods: We performed a coordinated analysis of three longitudinal studies with 9 to 25 years of follow-up. Data were used from older adults participating in H70 (Sweden; n = 441; aged \u226570 years), InCHIANTI (Italy; n = 955; aged \u226565 years), and LASA (the Netherlands; n = 2824; aged \u226555 years). Cognitive states were distinguished using the Mini-Mental State Examination. Slow gait speed was defined as the lowest sex-specific quintile at baseline. Multistate models were performed, adjusted for age, sex and education. Results: Most effect estimates pointed in the same direction, with slow gait speed predicting forward transitions. In two cohort studies, slow gait speed predicted transitioning from mild to severe cognitive impairment (InCHIANTI: HR = 2.08, 95%CI = 1.40\u20133.07; LASA: HR = 1.33, 95%CI = 1.01\u20131.75) and transitioning from a cognitively healthy state to death (H70: HR = 3.30, 95%CI = 1.74\u20136.28; LASA: HR = 1.70, 95%CI = 1.30\u20132.21). Conclusions: Screening for slow gait speed may be useful for identifying older adults at risk of adverse outcomes such as cognitive decline and death. However, once in the stage of more advanced cognitive impairment, slow gait speed does not seem to predict transitioning to death anymore.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cognition", "Dementia", "Multistate modeling", "Walking speed"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075264858", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"55250096200": {"Name": "Hoogendijk E.O.", "AuthorID": "55250096200", "AffiliationID": "60117142, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute, Amsterdam UMC - location VU University Medical Center"}, "56955697300": {"Name": "Rijnhart J.J.M.", "AuthorID": "56955697300", "AffiliationID": "60117142, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute, Amsterdam UMC - location VU University Medical Center"}, "55883271500": {"Name": "Huisman M.", "AuthorID": "55883271500", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology, VU University"}, "57193857074": {"Name": "Skoog J.", "AuthorID": "57193857074", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Centre for Health and Ageing AGECAP, University of Gothenburg"}, "24074784500": {"Name": "Robitaille A.", "AuthorID": "24074784500", "AffiliationID": "60027863", "AffiliationName": "D\u00e9partement de Psychologie, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec"}, "6603479955": {"Name": "van den Hout A.", "AuthorID": "6603479955", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "57202560201": {"Name": "Ferrucci L.", "AuthorID": "57202560201", "AffiliationID": "60017252", "AffiliationName": "National Institute on Aging"}, "7005834411": {"Name": "Skoog I.", "AuthorID": "7005834411", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Centre for Health and Ageing AGECAP, University of Gothenburg"}, "6603598774": {"Name": "Piccinin A.M.", "AuthorID": "6603598774", "AffiliationID": "60003122", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Victoria"}, "7004934589": {"Name": "Hofer S.M.", "AuthorID": "7004934589", "AffiliationID": "60003122", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Victoria"}, "35206359500": {"Name": "Muniz Terrera G.", "AuthorID": "35206359500", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Dementia Prevention, The University of Edinburgh"}}}
