Yet, the computational cost of KMC remains high, thereby motivating the development of acceleration schemes that would improve the simulation efficiency. We present an exact such scheme, which implements a caching algorithm along with shared-memory parallelization to improve the computational performance of simulations incorporating long-range adsorbate-adsorbate lateral interactions. This scheme is based on caching information about the energetic interaction patterns associated with the products of each possible lattice process (adsorption, desorption, reaction etc.). Thus, every time a reaction occurs (\"ongoing reaction\"), it enables fast updates of the rate constants of \"affected reactions\", i.e., possible reactions in the region of influence of the \"ongoing reaction\". Benchmarks on KMC simulations of NOx oxidation/reduction, yielded acceleration factors of up to 20, when comparing single-thread runs without caching to runs on 16 threads with caching, for simulations with a cluster expansion Hamiltonian that incorporates up to 8th-nearest-neighbor interactions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Computational performance", "Heterogeneously catalyzed reactions", "Kinetic monte carlo simulation", "Nearest-neighbor interactions", "Region of influences", "Shared memory parallelization", "Simulation efficiency", "Structure sensitivity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090291506", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57220225153": {"Name": "Ravipati S.", "AuthorID": "57220225153", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175885", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Young Centre and Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004483530": {"Name": "Stamatakis M.", "AuthorID": "7004483530", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175885", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Young Centre and Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "21933721700": {"Name": "D'Avezac M.", "AuthorID": "21933721700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Software Development Group, Research It Services, University College London"}, "55977165400": {"Name": "Nielsen J.", "AuthorID": "55977165400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Software Development Group, Research It Services, University College London"}, "23477084400": {"Name": "Hetherington J.", "AuthorID": "23477084400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Software Development Group, Research It Services, University College London"}}}
