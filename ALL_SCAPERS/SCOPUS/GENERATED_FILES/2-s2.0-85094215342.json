Data for these risk factors were then identified and matched by each of the twenty-two local government areas in Wales to each child that had data on height and weight in the Wales Childhood Measurement Programme (CMP) (2012-2017). Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify associations with childhood obesity.Setting:The current study was undertaken in Wales, UK, where approximately one in eight 4-5-year-olds are classified as obese.Participants:All participants were children aged 4 or 5 years who attend school, measured as part of the CMP, between 2012 and 2017 (n 129 893, mean age 5\u00b70 (sd 0\u00b74) years).Results:After adjusting for deprivation, small but statistically significant associations were found between childhood obesity and percentage of land available as accessible open space OR 0\u00b7981 (95 % CI: 0\u00b7973, 0\u00b7989) P < 0\u00b7001) and density of fast food outlets OR 1\u00b7002 (95 % CI 1\u00b7001, 1\u00b7004, P = 0\u00b7001). No other population-level risk factors were associated with childhood obesity.Conclusions:The current study indicates that, even after accounting for deprivation, risk factors such as the density of fast food outlets and access to green space should be considered when tackling childhood obesity as a public health issue.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Child", "Fast food", "Obesity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094215342", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57212991077": {"Name": "Beynon C.", "AuthorID": "57212991077", "AffiliationID": "60111558", "AffiliationName": "Public Health Wales"}, "57219613841": {"Name": "Bailey L.", "AuthorID": "57219613841", "AffiliationID": "60111558", "AffiliationName": "Public Health Wales"}, "57204528351": {"Name": "Pashayan N.", "AuthorID": "57204528351", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "7005610240": {"Name": "Raine R.", "AuthorID": "7005610240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "57219606501": {"Name": "Fisher E.", "AuthorID": "57219606501", "AffiliationID": "100471169", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Trust"}, "40461756100": {"Name": "Hargreaves D.S.", "AuthorID": "40461756100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Public Health, Imperial College London"}}}
