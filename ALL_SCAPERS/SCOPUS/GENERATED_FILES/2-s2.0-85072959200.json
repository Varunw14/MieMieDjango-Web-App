We then describe an alternative architecture of a single, lightweight ID-CondenseNet where a face detector-guided DC-GAN is used to generate distractor person images for enhanced training. For evaluation, we test both architectures on FLIMA, a new extension of an existing person re-identification dataset with added frame-by-frame annotations of face presence. Although the dual-stream CNN can outperform the CondenseNet approach on FLIMA, we show that the latter surpasses all state-of-the-art architectures in top-1 ranking performance when applied to the largest existing person re-identification dataset, MSMT17. We conclude that whilst re-identification performance is highly sensitive to the structure of datasets, distractor augmentation and network compression have a role to play for enhancing performance characteristics for larger scale applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deep face analysis", "Distractor synthesis", "GANs", "Person Re-ID"], "IndexKeywords": ["Face analysis", "GANs", "Network compression", "Performance characteristics", "Person re identifications", "Person Re-ID", "Ranking performance", "Re identifications"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072959200", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"55867544400": {"Name": "Ponce-L\u00f3pez V.", "AuthorID": "55867544400", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Bristol"}, "24461140200": {"Name": "Burghardt T.", "AuthorID": "24461140200", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Bristol"}, "57221122421": {"Name": "Sun Y.", "AuthorID": "57221122421", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Bristol"}, "9239823000": {"Name": "Hannuna S.", "AuthorID": "9239823000", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Bristol"}, "25654582700": {"Name": "Damen D.", "AuthorID": "25654582700", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Bristol"}, "7004105162": {"Name": "Mirmehdi M.", "AuthorID": "7004105162", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Bristol"}}}
