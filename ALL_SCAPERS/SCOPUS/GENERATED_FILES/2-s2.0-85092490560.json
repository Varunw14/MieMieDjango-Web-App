We investigate the competitive role of the different dissipative phenomena acting on the onset of star formation of this gravitationally bound systems in this external environment. Ram pressure, Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh- Taylor instabilities, and tidal forces are accounted for separately in an analytical framework and compared in their role in influencing the star forming regions. We present an analytical criterion to elucidate the dependence of star formation in a spherical stellar system on its surrounding environment, useful in observational applications as well as theoretical interpretations of numerical results. We consider the different signatures of these phenomena in synthetically realized colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of the orbiting system, thus investigating the detectability limits and relevance of these different effects for future observational projects. The theoretical framework developed has direct applications to the cases of our MW system as well as dwarf galaxies in galaxy clusters or any primordial gas-rich star cluster of stars orbiting within its host galaxy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["galaxies: dwarf", "Galaxy: fundamental parameters", "Galaxy: halo"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092490560", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"8589115100": {"Name": "Pasetto S.", "AuthorID": "8589115100", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "7004529134": {"Name": "Cropper M.", "AuthorID": "7004529134", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "35596431900": {"Name": "Fujita Y.", "AuthorID": "35596431900", "AffiliationID": "60024322", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Space Science, Graduate School of Science, Osaka University"}, "7003548996": {"Name": "Chiosi C.", "AuthorID": "7003548996", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Physics and AstronomyGalileo Galilei, University of Padua"}, "7006056290": {"Name": "Grebel E.K.", "AuthorID": "7006056290", "AffiliationID": "60072297, 60016908", "AffiliationName": "Astronomisches Rechen-Institut, Zentrum f\u00fcr Astronomie der Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg"}}}
