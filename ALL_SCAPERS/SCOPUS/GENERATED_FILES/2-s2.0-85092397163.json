We review the existing modelling approaches to this topic and derive a novel mathematical model to describe the crosstalk between these components within the conceptual framework of inflammaging. Analysis of the model gives insight into the dynamics of garbage concentration and linked microglial senescence process resulting from a normal or disrupted sleep pattern, hence, explaining an underlying mechanism behind healthy or unhealthy brain aging. The model incorporates accumulation and elimination of garbage, induction of glial activation by garbage, and glial senescence by over-activation, as well as the production of pro-inflammatory molecules by their senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Assuming that insufficient sleep leads to the increase of garbage concentration and promotes senescence, the model predicts that if the accumulation of senescent glia overcomes an inflammaging threshold, further progression of senescence becomes unstoppable even if a normal sleep pattern is restored. Inverting this process by \u201crejuvenating the brain\u201d is only possible via a reset of concentration of senescent glia below this threshold. Our model approach enables analysis of space-time dynamics of senescence, and in this way, we show that heterogeneous patterns of inflammation will accelerate the propagation of senescence profile through a network, confirming a negative effect of heterogeneity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aging", "Cell", "Glymphatic system", "Inflammaging", "Microglia", "Senescence", "Sleep", "Waste solutes"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092397163", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"55328272900": {"Name": "Gordleeva S.", "AuthorID": "55328272900", "AffiliationID": "60105869", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience and Cognitive Technology Laboratory, Center for Technologies in Robotics and Mechatronics Components, Innopolis University"}, "8958614400": {"Name": "Kanakov O.", "AuthorID": "8958614400", "AffiliationID": "60008673", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Systems Medicine of Healthy Aging, Lobachevsky Univeristy"}, "6603861723": {"Name": "Ivanchenko M.", "AuthorID": "6603861723", "AffiliationID": "60008673", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Systems Medicine of Healthy Aging, Lobachevsky Univeristy"}, "7103103296": {"Name": "Zaikin A.", "AuthorID": "7103103296", "AffiliationID": "60010188", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Analysis of Complex Systems, Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University (Sechenov University)"}, "56236886700": {"Name": "Franceschi C.", "AuthorID": "56236886700", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Pathology, University of Bologna"}}}
