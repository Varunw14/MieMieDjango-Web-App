Objectives: To compare the effect of a targeted, low-burden, and stepped invitation strategy versus control on uptake of hospital-based Lung Health Check appointments offering LDCT screening. Methods: In a two-arm, blinded, between-subjects, randomized controlled trial, 2,012 participants were selected from 16 primary care practices using these criteria: 1) aged 60 to 75 years, 2) recorded as a current smoker within the last 7 years, and 3) no prespecified exclusion criteria contraindicating LDCT screening. Both groups received a stepped sequence of preinvitation, invitation, and reminder letters from their primary care practitioner offering prescheduled appointments. The key manipulation was the accompanying leaflet. The intervention group's leaflet targeted psychological barriers and provided low-burden information, mimicking the concept of the U.K. Ministry of Transport's annual vehicle test (\u201cM.O.T. For Your Lungs\u201d). Measurements and Main Results: Uptake was 52.6%, with no difference between intervention (52.3%) and control (52.9%) groups in unadjusted (odds ratio [OR], 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82-1.16) or adjusted (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.82-1.17) analyses. Current smokers were less likely to attend (adjusted OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.56-0.86) than former smokers. Socioeconomic deprivation was significantly associated with lower uptake for the control group only (P, 0.01). Conclusions: The intervention did not improve uptake. Regardless of trial arm, uptake was considerably higher than previous clinical and real-world studies, particularly given that the samples were predominantly lower socioeconomic position smokers. Strategies common to both groups, including a Lung Health Check approach, could represent a minimum standard.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Behavioral sciences", "Early detection of cancer", "Lung neoplasms", "Socioeconomic factors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Breath Tests", "Carbon Monoxide", "Early Detection of Cancer", "Ex-Smokers", "Female", "Humans", "Lung Neoplasms", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Patient Compliance", "Patient Selection", "Smokers", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Spirometry", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083544073", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"]], "AuthorData": {"55908894400": {"Name": "Quaife S.L.", "AuthorID": "55908894400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "36196242700": {"Name": "Beeken R.J.", "AuthorID": "36196242700", "AffiliationID": "60023959, 60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Health Sciences, University of Leeds"}, "7102146930": {"Name": "Wardle J.", "AuthorID": "7102146930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "57191898211": {"Name": "Waller J.", "AuthorID": "57191898211", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, King's College London"}, "56741246300": {"Name": "Ruparel M.", "AuthorID": "56741246300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lungs for Living Research Centre, UCL Respiratory, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "57209173836": {"Name": "Dickson J.L.", "AuthorID": "57209173836", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lungs for Living Research Centre, UCL Respiratory, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "56514246800": {"Name": "Janes S.M.", "AuthorID": "56514246800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lungs for Living Research Centre, UCL Respiratory, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "57216283722": {"Name": "McEwen A.", "AuthorID": "57216283722", "AffiliationID": "121918720", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training"}, "7201847045": {"Name": "Baldwin D.R.", "AuthorID": "7201847045", "AffiliationID": "60025016", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory Medicine Unit, David Evans Research Centre, Nottingham University Hospitals"}, "7006533792": {"Name": "Bhowmik A.", "AuthorID": "7006533792", "AffiliationID": "60005523", "AffiliationName": "Department of Thoracic Medicine, Homerton University Hospital"}, "57216600612": {"Name": "Navani N.", "AuthorID": "57216600612", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Thoracic Medicine, University College London Hospital"}, "55500463200": {"Name": "Sennett K.", "AuthorID": "55500463200", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Killick Street Health Centre"}, "35942266800": {"Name": "Duffy S.W.", "AuthorID": "35942266800", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
