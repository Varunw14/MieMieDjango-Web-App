Children & Society published by National Children\u2019s Bureau and John Wiley & Sons LtdThis paper focuses on two cohorts of Norwegian young men whose behaviour in childhood and adolescence caused serious concern to their parents, teachers, social workers and, in some cases, the police, Despite having been identified as \u2018at risk\u2019, they made transitions to positive adult masculine identities in two different historical contexts; the 1980s and 2000s. The paper analyses the difference that historical context makes to these young men\u2019s lives, their gendered identity work and their perspectives on their past, present and future. In particular, it identifies the ways in which supportive intergenerational relationships and significant others serve to produce positive turning points and, over time, help the young men to develop resilience and potentially happy and successful futures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adolescence", "agency", "behaviour problems", "bullying", "parenting"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077893601", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Life-span and Life-course Studies", "SOCI", "3319"]], "AuthorData": {"6701732368": {"Name": "Solem M.B.", "AuthorID": "6701732368", "AffiliationID": "60068730", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Social Sciences, Oslo Metropolitan University"}, "6507370833": {"Name": "Helgeland I.M.", "AuthorID": "6507370833", "AffiliationID": "60068730", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Social Sciences, Oslo Metropolitan University"}, "7003770079": {"Name": "Brannen J.", "AuthorID": "7003770079", "AffiliationID": "60117701, 60006242", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Coram Research Unit, Department of Social Science, UCL Institute of Education"}, "7004228641": {"Name": "Phoenix A.", "AuthorID": "7004228641", "AffiliationID": "60117701, 60006242", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Coram Research Unit, Department of Social Science, UCL Institute of Education"}}}
