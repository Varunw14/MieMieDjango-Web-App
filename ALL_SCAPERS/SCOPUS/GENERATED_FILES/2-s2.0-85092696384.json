Deli\u0107, et al. Science, vol. 367, p. 892, 2020), macroscopic quantum sensors are seemingly on the horizon. The nanosphere's large mass as compared to other quantum systems enhances the susceptibility of the nanoparticle to gravitational and inertial forces. In this viewpoint, we describe the features of experiments with optically levitated nanoparticles (J. Millen, T. S. Monteiro, R. Pettit, and A. N. Vamivakas, \"Optomechanics with levitated particles,\"Rep. Prog. Phys., vol. 83, 2020, Art no. 026401) and their proposed utility for acceleration sensing. Unique to the levitated nanoparticle platform is the ability to implement not only quantum noise limited transduction, predicted by quantum metrology to reach sensitivities on the order of 10-15 ms-2 (S. Qvarfort, A. Serafini, P. F. Barker, and S. Bose, \"Gravimetry through non-linear optomechanics,\"Nat. Commun., vol. 9, 2018, Art no. 3690) but also long-lived quantum spatial superpositions for enhanced gravimetry. This follows a global trend in developing sensors, such as cold-atom interferometers, that exploit superposition or entanglement. Thanks to significant commercial development of these existing quantum technologies, we discuss the feasibility of translating levitated nanoparticle research into applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["gravimetry", "inertial sensor", "quantum", "quantum metrology", "sensing", "superposition"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092696384", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"57204762183": {"Name": "Rademacher M.", "AuthorID": "57204762183", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56737280500": {"Name": "Li Y.L.", "AuthorID": "56737280500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "22985827000": {"Name": "Millen J.", "AuthorID": "22985827000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, King's College London"}}}
