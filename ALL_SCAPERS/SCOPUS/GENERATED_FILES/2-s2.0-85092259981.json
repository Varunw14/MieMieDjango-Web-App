We find that the C. elegans orthologue of MELK, PIG-1, promotes apoptosis by partitioning an anti-apoptotic factor. The C. elegans NSM neuroblast divides to produce a larger cell that differentiates into a neuron and a smaller cell that dies. We find that in this context, PIG-1 MELK is required for partitioning of CES-1 Snail, a transcriptional repressor of the pro-apoptotic gene egl-1 BH3-only. pig-1 MELK is controlled by both a ces-1 Snail- and par-4 LKB1-dependent pathway, and may act through phosphorylation and cortical enrichment of nonmuscle myosin II prior to neuroblast division. We propose that pig-1 MELK-induced local contractility of the actomyosin network plays a conserved role in the acquisition of the apoptotic fate. Our work also uncovers an auto-regulatory loop through which ces-1 Snail controls its own activity through the formation of a gradient of CES-1 Snail protein.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Actomyosin", "Animals", "Animals, Genetically Modified", "Apoptosis", "Caenorhabditis elegans", "Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins", "Cell Death", "Cell Polarity", "Cytoskeletal Proteins", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Myosin Type II", "Neural Stem Cells", "Neurons", "Phosphorylation", "Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Snail Family Transcription Factors", "Transcription Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092259981", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"57195318711": {"Name": "Wei H.", "AuthorID": "57195318711", "AffiliationID": "60026695, 60014739", "AffiliationName": "UT Southwestern Medical Center, Department of Pharmacology"}, "7003524809": {"Name": "Lambie E.J.", "AuthorID": "7003524809", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "26642930200": {"Name": "Conradt B.", "AuthorID": "26642930200", "AffiliationID": "60075024", "AffiliationName": "CIPSM, Center for Integrated Protein Science Munich"}, "55226149100": {"Name": "Os\u00f3rio D.S.", "AuthorID": "55226149100", "AffiliationID": "60105804, 60007249", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o e Inova\u00e7\u00e3o em Sa\u00fade, Universidade do Porto"}, "24544402200": {"Name": "Carvalho A.X.", "AuthorID": "24544402200", "AffiliationID": "60105804, 60007249", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o e Inova\u00e7\u00e3o em Sa\u00fade, Universidade do Porto"}}}
