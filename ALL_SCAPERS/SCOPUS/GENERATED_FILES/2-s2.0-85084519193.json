We assessed Ca intake from diet and medications in children with CKD stages 4\u20135 and on dialysis (CKD4\u20135D) and age-matched controls, comparing with the UK Reference Nutrient Intake (RNI) and international recommendations. Methods: Three-day prospective diet diaries were recorded in 23 children with CKD4\u20135, 23 with CKD5D, and 27 controls. Doses of phosphate (P) binders and Ca supplements were recorded. Results: Median dietary Ca intake in CKD4\u20135D was 480 (interquartile range (IQR) 300\u2013621) vs 724 (IQR 575\u2013852) mg/day in controls (p = 0.00002), providing 81% vs 108% RNI (p = 0.002). Seventy-six percent of patients received ' 100% RNI. In CKD4\u20135D, 40% dietary Ca was provided from dairy foods vs 56% in controls. Eighty percent of CKD4\u20135D children were prescribed Ca-based P-binders, 15% Ca supplements, and 9% both medications, increasing median daily Ca intake to 1145 (IQR 665\u20131649) mg/day; 177% RNI. Considering the total daily Ca intake from diet and medications, 15% received ' 100% RNI, 44% 100\u2013200% RNI, and 41% ' 200% RNI. Three children (6%) exceeded the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) upper limit of 2500 mg/day. None with a total Ca intake ' RNI was hypocalcemic, and only one having ' 2 \u00d7 RNI was hypercalcemic. Conclusions: Seventy-six percent of children with CKD4\u20135D had a dietary Ca intake ' 100% RNI. Restriction of dairy foods as part of a P-controlled diet limits Ca intake. Additional Ca from medications is required to meet the KDOQI guideline of 100\u2013200% normal recommended Ca intake.
