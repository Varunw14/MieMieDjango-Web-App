The recent adoption of alternative drug delivery options has led to the development of new sustained-delivery corticosteroid systems, able to manage successfully chronic noninfectious posterior uveitis. The treatment goal is to target the site of inflammation with low dose of corticosteroids, delivered over an extended period of time, to minimize the cumulative damage resulting from repeated recurrences, reducing both injections frequency and ocular side effects. This article will review the pharmacology and preliminary clinical data of the 0.18 mg fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant (YUTIQ\u2122), to show its efficacy and safety in the treatment of noninfectious posterior uveitis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["fluocinolone acetonide", "intravitreal corticosteroid implant", "noninfectious uveitis", "posterior uveitis", "sustained-release drug delivery system", "YUTIQ\u2122"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chronic Disease", "Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic", "Delayed-Action Preparations", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Drug Implants", "Drug Liberation", "Fluocinolone Acetonide", "Glucocorticoids", "Humans", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Treatment Outcome", "Uveitis, Posterior"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074744033", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"57190493331": {"Name": "Testi I.", "AuthorID": "57190493331", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7003495942": {"Name": "Pavesio C.", "AuthorID": "7003495942", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital, NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
