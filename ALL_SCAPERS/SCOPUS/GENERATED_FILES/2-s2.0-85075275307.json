Our purpose was to analyze the relationship of aVR-STE to MVD disease or cardiogenic shock (CS) in patients with inferior myocardial infarction (inferior STEMI). Methods: We analyzed two cohorts of consecutive patients admitted for inferior STEMI in the Coronary Unit of two university hospitals. ST elevation and ST depression in each derivation were compared between patients with and without MVD and with and without CS. Results: We included 342 patients\u201419.6% women and 80.4% men\u2014with a median age of 60 (52, 70); 18 patients (5.2%) had MVD, and 25 (7.3%) patients presented CS. There was no relationship between ST elevation or ST depression in either derivation and MVD. In contrast, CS was associated with aVR-STE, ST-segment depression in lead aVL, and the sum of ST-segment depression. aVR-STE of 0.25 mm had a sensitivity of 24.0% and a specificity of 95.9% for CS. After multivariate analysis including clinical variables, aVR-STE was independently associated with CS. Conclusions: In patients with inferior STEMI, ST-segment analysis was not useful in predicting multivessel disease. aVR-STE was an independent predictor of CS, with high specificity but low sensitivity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acute coronary syndrome", "aVR", "Cardiogenic shock", "Inferior myocardial infarction", "Prognosis", "ST segment elevation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075275307", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"19338073700": {"Name": "Ruiz-Mateos B.", "AuthorID": "19338073700", "AffiliationID": "121825162", "AffiliationName": "AMIR Academy"}, "23977728000": {"Name": "Almendro-Delia M.", "AuthorID": "23977728000", "AffiliationID": "60002196", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, University Hospital Virgen Macarena"}, "24066706600": {"Name": "Garc\u00eda-Borbolla R.", "AuthorID": "24066706600", "AffiliationID": "60002196", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, University Hospital Virgen Macarena"}, "57200229194": {"Name": "Seoane-Garc\u00eda T.", "AuthorID": "57200229194", "AffiliationID": "60002196", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, University Hospital Virgen Macarena"}, "57210107381": {"Name": "Lorenzo-Lopez B.", "AuthorID": "57210107381", "AffiliationID": "60002196", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, University Hospital Virgen Macarena"}, "57210120291": {"Name": "Garcia-Gonzalez N.", "AuthorID": "57210120291", "AffiliationID": "60002196", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, University Hospital Virgen Macarena"}, "6602590723": {"Name": "Hidalgo-Urbano R.", "AuthorID": "6602590723", "AffiliationID": "60002196", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, University Hospital Virgen Macarena"}, "7003329165": {"Name": "Garcia-Rubira J.", "AuthorID": "7003329165", "AffiliationID": "60002196", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, University Hospital Virgen Macarena"}, "23025470300": {"Name": "Nunez-Gil I.", "AuthorID": "23025470300", "AffiliationID": "60032461", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Cl\u00ednico San Carlos"}, "57204645170": {"Name": "Vivas D.", "AuthorID": "57204645170", "AffiliationID": "60032461", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Cl\u00ednico San Carlos"}, "56517073500": {"Name": "Fernandez-Ortiz A.", "AuthorID": "56517073500", "AffiliationID": "60032461", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Cl\u00ednico San Carlos"}, "13907649300": {"Name": "Ibanez B.", "AuthorID": "13907649300", "AffiliationID": "118354380", "AffiliationName": "CIBER de Enfermedades Cardiovasculares (CIBERCV)"}}}
