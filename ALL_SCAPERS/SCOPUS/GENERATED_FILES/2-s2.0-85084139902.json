Methods: Adults and children with CNGB3-achromatopsia underwent visual acuity testing, ocular motility assessments, video nystagmography, and SD-OCT imaging. Qualitative assessment of foveal structure was performed by grading SD-OCT images into one of five categories. Results: A total of 18 subjects (11 adults) were included. The majority demonstrated a phoria, with manifest strabismus present in only 3 subjects. The predominant nystagmus waveform within the cohort was pure pendular. Nine individuals demonstrated a mixture of waveforms. Nystagmus frequencies were 4-8 cycles/second, with no notable differences in eye movements between adults and children. SD-OCT imaging revealed a continuous ellipsoid zone (EZ) at the fovea in 2 subjects (grade 1) and EZ disruption (grade 2) in the remaining 16. Retinal structure characteristics were symmetrical in both eyes in each subject. Conclusions: In our study cohort, nystagmus in CNGB3-associated achromatopsia had distinctive features, and the majority of subjects had retinal abnormalities at the fovea on SD-OCT. Early use of SD-OCT in the clinical work-up may eliminate the need for more invasive investigations, such as neuro-imaging.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084139902", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"8863695000": {"Name": "Hirji N.", "AuthorID": "8863695000", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "16025649500": {"Name": "Theodorou M.", "AuthorID": "16025649500", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7005169657": {"Name": "Bainbridge J.W.", "AuthorID": "7005169657", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "57202482672": {"Name": "Michaelides M.", "AuthorID": "57202482672", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "57213187199": {"Name": "Venturi N.", "AuthorID": "57213187199", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}}}
