Identifying the causes associated to mould growth and taking correct remedial actions can be essential in reducing the prevalence of this problem. In practice it is often complex, even for experts, to accurately identify some of these causes and this can lead to costly and unnecessary interventions. Towards development of a novel systematic diagnostic procedure an extensive monitoring exercise has been undertaken involving collection of environmental data from dwellings with and without mould issues. The data has been analysed, considering building characteristics and occupancy's lifestyle features, with the objective to identify thresholds on measurable parameters that are indicative of mould growth risks. The proposed methodology links key parameters to identify factors that contribute to surface condensation and mould growth in buildings. This research presents a process towards environmental data collection, post-processing to compute and interpret pertinent environmental parameters, and displaying them in a clear and easy-To-interpret manner.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Atmospheric moisture", "Building characteristics", "Diagnostic procedure", "Environmental parameter", "Indoor air quality", "Intermittent heating", "Measurable parameters", "Surface condensation"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074390868", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"57220324725": {"Name": "Lopez-Arce P.", "AuthorID": "57220324725", "AffiliationID": "119226715", "AffiliationName": "Property Care Association, PCA"}, "26533827300": {"Name": "Altamirano-Medina H.", "AuthorID": "26533827300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering, University College London, UCL"}, "6507344235": {"Name": "Rovas D.", "AuthorID": "6507344235", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering, University College London, UCL"}, "57211562641": {"Name": "Berry J.", "AuthorID": "57211562641", "AffiliationID": "119226715", "AffiliationName": "Property Care Association, PCA"}, "57211558625": {"Name": "Hodgson S.", "AuthorID": "57211558625", "AffiliationID": "119226715", "AffiliationName": "Property Care Association, PCA"}, "57211553013": {"Name": "Sarce F.", "AuthorID": "57211553013", "AffiliationID": "60105371", "AffiliationName": "Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Chile"}}}
