Experimental periodontitis was induced by injections of Pg-LPS. Gingival soft and hard tissues changes were analysed by means of magnetic resonance imaging and micro computed tomography. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, pentraxin (PTX) 3, and soluble fragment of tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (sTWEAK) were determined at baseline and 24 h, 7, 14, and 21 days after periodontal induction. Significant periodontal inflammation and alveolar bone loss were evident at the end of periodontal induction. Experimental periodontitis posed an acute systemic inflammatory response with increased serum levels of IL-6 and PTX3 at 24 h post-induction, followed by a significant overexpression of sTWEAK at 7 days. This inflammatory state was maintained until the end of the experiment (21 days). As expected, IL-10 serum levels were significantly lower during the follow-up compared to baseline concentrations. In the present animal model, experimental periodontitis is associated with increased systemic inflammation. Further studies are needed to confirm whether PTX3 and sTWEAK could be useful biomarkers to investigate potential mechanisms underlying the relationship between periodontitis and atherosclerotic vascular diseases.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Endothelial dysfunction", "Inflammation", "Lipopolysaccharide", "Periodontitis", "Porphyromonas gingivalis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alveolar Bone Loss", "Animals", "Biomarkers", "Disease Models, Animal", "Periodontitis", "Porphyromonas gingivalis", "Rats", "X-Ray Microtomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073994999", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"56707470700": {"Name": "Leira Y.", "AuthorID": "56707470700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013985", "AffiliationName": "Periodontology Unit, UCL Eastman Dental Institute and Hospital, University College London"}, "57061663300": {"Name": "Blanco J.", "AuthorID": "57061663300", "AffiliationID": "60028419, 60019316", "AffiliationName": "Periodontology Unit, Faculty of Medicine and Odontology, University of Santiago de Compostela, Medical-Surgical Dentistry (OMEQUI) Research Group, Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS)"}, "57198744550": {"Name": "D\u2019Aiuto F.", "AuthorID": "57198744550", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013985", "AffiliationName": "Periodontology Unit, UCL Eastman Dental Institute and Hospital, University College London"}, "57190743110": {"Name": "Iglesias-Rey R.", "AuthorID": "57190743110", "AffiliationID": "60002983", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurosciences Research Laboratory, Clinical University Hospital, Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS)"}, "12769820300": {"Name": "Sobrino T.", "AuthorID": "12769820300", "AffiliationID": "60002983", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurosciences Research Laboratory, Clinical University Hospital, Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS)"}, "55766041200": {"Name": "Castillo J.", "AuthorID": "55766041200", "AffiliationID": "60002983", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurosciences Research Laboratory, Clinical University Hospital, Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS)"}, "14618933700": {"Name": "Campos F.", "AuthorID": "14618933700", "AffiliationID": "60002983", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurosciences Research Laboratory, Clinical University Hospital, Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS)"}, "57193345387": {"Name": "G\u00f3mez-Lado N.", "AuthorID": "57193345387", "AffiliationID": "60002983, 60028419, 60019316", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Imaging Group, Clinical University Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, University of Santiago de Compostela, Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS)"}, "8531886300": {"Name": "Aguiar P.", "AuthorID": "8531886300", "AffiliationID": "60002983, 60028419, 60019316", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Imaging Group, Clinical University Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, University of Santiago de Compostela, Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS)"}}}
