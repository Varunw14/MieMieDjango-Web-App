We investigated the impact of HCV cure on CKD in HIV-positive persons in the EuroSIDA study. METHODS: HIV-positive persons with known HCV status and at least three serum creatinine measurements after 1/1/2004 were compared based on time-updated HCV-RNA and HCV treatment: anti-HCV-negative, spontaneously cleared HCV, chronic untreated HCV, successfully treated HCV, and HCV-RNA positive after HCV treatment. Poisson regression compared incidence rates of CKD [confirmed (>3 months apart) eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m] between HCV strata. RESULTS: Fourteen thousand, seven hundred and fifty-four persons were included; at baseline 9273 (62.9%) were HCV-Ab negative, 696 (4.7%) spontaneous clearers, 3021 (20.5%) chronically infected, 922 (6.2%) successfully treated and 842 (5.7%) HCV-RNA positive after treatment. During 115 335 person-years of follow-up (PYFU), 1128 (7.6%) developed CKD; crude incidence 9.8/1000 PYFU (95% CI 9.2-10.4). After adjustment, persons anti-HCV negative [adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) 0.59; 95% CI 0.46-0.75] and spontaneous clearers (aIRR 0.67; 95% CI 0.47-0.97) had significantly lower rates of CKD compared with those cured whereas persons chronically infected (aIRR 0.85; 95% CI 0.65-1.12) and HCV-RNA positive after treatment (aIRR 0.71; 95% CI 0.49-1.04) had similar rates. Analysis in those without F3/F4 liver fibrosis using a more rigorous definition of CKD showed similar results. CONCLUSION: This large study found no evidence that successful HCV treatment reduced CKD incidence. Confounding by indication, where those with highest risk of CKD were prioritized for HCV treatment in the DAA era, may contribute to these findings.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088156784", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"7006513758": {"Name": "Mocroft A.", "AuthorID": "7006513758", "AffiliationID": "124801139", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Research, Epidemiology, Modelling and Evaluation (CREME)"}, "57218174333": {"Name": "Li Q.", "AuthorID": "57218174333", "AffiliationID": "124801139", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Research, Epidemiology, Modelling and Evaluation (CREME)"}, "54924488100": {"Name": "Ryom L.", "AuthorID": "54924488100", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Centre of Excellence for Health, Immunity and Infections (CHIP)"}, "15058026800": {"Name": "Peters L.", "AuthorID": "15058026800", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Centre of Excellence for Health, Immunity and Infections (CHIP)"}, "21636591500": {"Name": "Oprea C.", "AuthorID": "21636591500", "AffiliationID": "60012910", "AffiliationName": "Victor Babes Clinical Hospital for Infectious and Tropical Diseases"}, "35308968700": {"Name": "Rauch A.", "AuthorID": "35308968700", "AffiliationID": "60010987", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Bern University Hospital"}, "8855189300": {"Name": "Boesecke C.", "AuthorID": "8855189300", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine I"}, "56884779800": {"Name": "Uzdaviniene V.", "AuthorID": "56884779800", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Vilnius University Hospital Santariskiu Klinikos"}, "57202125317": {"Name": "Sedlacek D.", "AuthorID": "57202125317", "AffiliationID": "60016605", "AffiliationName": "Charles University Hospital Plzen"}, "35401578400": {"Name": "Llibre J.M.", "AuthorID": "35401578400", "AffiliationID": "60028462", "AffiliationName": null}, "6602251389": {"Name": "Lacombe K.", "AuthorID": "6602251389", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, AP-HP"}, "7202609719": {"Name": "Nielsen L.N.", "AuthorID": "7202609719", "AffiliationID": "60022645", "AffiliationName": "Nordsj\u00e6llands Hospital"}, "6701464872": {"Name": "Florence E.", "AuthorID": "6701464872", "AffiliationID": "60028863", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Tropical Medicine"}, "36436796700": {"Name": "Aho I.", "AuthorID": "36436796700", "AffiliationID": "60016987", "AffiliationName": "Helsinki University Hospital, Division of Infectious Diseases"}, "25227423400": {"Name": "Chkhartishvili N.", "AuthorID": "25227423400", "AffiliationID": "100454714", "AffiliationName": null}, "6602551338": {"Name": "Szlavik J.", "AuthorID": "6602551338", "AffiliationID": "101564943", "AffiliationName": "South-Pest Hospital Centre, National Institute for Infectology and Haematology"}, "23396934400": {"Name": "Dragovic G.", "AuthorID": "23396934400", "AffiliationID": "60068815, 60068827", "AffiliationName": "University of Belgrade, School of Medicine"}, "16747269600": {"Name": "Leen C.", "AuthorID": "16747269600", "AffiliationID": "60013999", "AffiliationName": "Western General Hospital"}, "57201621059": {"Name": "Sambatakou H.", "AuthorID": "57201621059", "AffiliationID": "60069142", "AffiliationName": "Ippokration General Hospital"}, "56992899600": {"Name": "Staub T.", "AuthorID": "56992899600", "AffiliationID": "118810017", "AffiliationName": "Centre Hospitalier de Luxembourg, Service des Maladies Infectieuses"}, "35780408100": {"Name": "Laguno M.", "AuthorID": "35780408100", "AffiliationID": "60030315", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Clinic, Infectious Diseases Service"}, "6603096114": {"Name": "Elinav H.", "AuthorID": "6603096114", "AffiliationID": "60000087", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Hadassah Hospital"}, "6603749556": {"Name": "Toma\u017ei\u010d J.", "AuthorID": "6603749556", "AffiliationID": "60021479", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Ljubljana University Medical Center"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
