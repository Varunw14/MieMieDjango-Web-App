Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Men who have sex with men (MSM) in England are eligible for vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) via specialist sexual health services and HIV clinics. Uptake among clinic attendees is incomplete, but the reason for this is unclear. We do not know who is accessing and being offered the vaccine. This cross-sectional study conducted in England examined socio-demographic correlates of vaccine uptake for MSM and how frequently the vaccine is being offered in clinics. MSM completed an online questionnaire asking about socio-demographic characteristics, whether they had recently attended a sexual health or HIV clinic, and if so, whether they had been offered the vaccine, and vaccination status. Around 52% of MSM (N = 115; mean age = 30.2) had received at least one dose of the vaccine, and 70% of clinic attendees had been offered the vaccine. MSM were more likely to have initiated the vaccine series if they were homosexual (versus bisexual; OR: 5.22; 95% CI: 1.55\u201317.51) or had heard about the vaccine from one or two types of sources (versus no sources: OR: 14.70; 95% CI: 4.00\u201354.00 and OR: 26.00; 5.74\u2013117.77 respectively). Initiation was not associated with age, ethnicity, education level, or number of sexual partners. Hepatitis B vaccination status was associated with vaccination initiation only in unadjusted models. The majority of eligible MSM are being offered the vaccine in clinics. Socio-demographic differences in uptake of the HPV vaccine among MSM may lead to inequalities in HPV-related disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Human papillomavirus", "Men who have sex with men", "Sexual health", "Sexually transmitted infections", "Vaccination"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cross-Sectional Studies", "England", "Humans", "Male", "Papillomavirus Infections", "Papillomavirus Vaccines", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Sexual and Gender Minorities", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Vaccination"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85093922806", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis", "ENVI", "2307"]], "AuthorData": {"57217054993": {"Name": "Stearns S.", "AuthorID": "57217054993", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, UCL"}, "55908894400": {"Name": "Quaife S.L.", "AuthorID": "55908894400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, UCL"}, "16300728600": {"Name": "Forster A.", "AuthorID": "16300728600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, UCL"}}}
