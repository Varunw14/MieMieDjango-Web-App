ESC Heart Failure published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of the European Society of CardiologyAims: Efforts to improve access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) have shifted morbidity and mortality among persons living with HIV (PLWH) from AIDS to non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, contemporary data on CVD among PLWH in sub-Saharan Africa in the current ART era are lacking. The aim of this study was to assess the burden of cardiac stress among PLWH in South Africa via measurement of N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Methods and results: NT-proBNP was measured at baseline in 224 PLWH enrolled in a sub-study of a tuberculosis vaccine trial in Khayelitsha township near Cape Town, South Africa. Thresholds were applied at the assay's limit of detection (\u2265137 pg/mL) and a level indicative of symptomatic heart failure in the acute setting ('300 pg/mL). Mean (SD) age of participants was 39 (6) years, 86% were female, and 19% were hypertensive. Mean (SD) duration of HIV diagnosis was 8.3 (3.9) years and CD4 + count was 673 (267) with 79% prescribed ART for a duration of 5.6 (2.7) years. Thirty-one percent of participants had NT-proBNP ' 300 pg/mL. Elevated vs. undetectable NT-proBNP level was associated with older age (P = 0.04), no ART (P = 0.03), and higher plasma tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (P = 0.01). Conclusions: Among South African PLWH largely free of known CVD and on ART with high CD4 + counts and few comorbidities, we observed a high proportion with elevated NT-proBNP levels, suggesting the burden of cardiac stress in this population may be high. This observation underscores the need for more in-depth research, including the current effect of HIV on heart failure risk among a growing ART-treated population in sub-Saharan Africa.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardiac stress", "HIV infection", "NT-proBNP", "South Africa"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087168712", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57205217212": {"Name": "Peterson T.E.", "AuthorID": "57205217212", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "Division of Epidemiology and Community Health, University of Minnesota"}, "15070550000": {"Name": "Baker J.V.", "AuthorID": "15070550000", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota"}, "57217386574": {"Name": "Wong L.Y.", "AuthorID": "57217386574", "AffiliationID": "60016733", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Oregon Health Sciences University"}, "7004495467": {"Name": "Rupert A.", "AuthorID": "7004495467", "AffiliationID": "60109509", "AffiliationName": "Leidos Biomedical Research Inc, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"}, "55409586900": {"Name": "Ntusi N.A.B.", "AuthorID": "55409586900", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Cape Town"}, "7402272158": {"Name": "Wilkinson R.", "AuthorID": "7402272158", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Francis Crick Institute"}, "13612258700": {"Name": "Meintjes G.", "AuthorID": "13612258700", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Africa, Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine and Department of Medicine, University of Cape Town"}, "11340073300": {"Name": "Ntsekhe M.", "AuthorID": "11340073300", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Cape Town"}, "6504339504": {"Name": "Thienemann F.", "AuthorID": "6504339504", "AffiliationID": "60019619", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University Hospital Zurich"}, "20433723200": {"Name": "Esmail H.", "AuthorID": "20433723200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "6603616412": {"Name": "Sereti I.", "AuthorID": "6603616412", "AffiliationID": "60017336, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health"}}}
