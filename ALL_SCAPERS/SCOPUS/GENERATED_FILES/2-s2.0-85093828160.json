Conventional mathematical tools of this theme, however, are incapable of accounting for several important attributes of such systems, such as the intelligent and adaptive behavior exhibited by individual agents. This unrealistic setting is often insufficient to simulate properties of population dynamics found in the real-world. In this work, we leverage multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, and we propose a new model of large-scale predator-prey ecosystems. Using different variants of our proposed environment, we show that multi-agent simulations can exhibit key real-world dynamical properties. To obtain this behavior, we firstly define a mating mechanism such that existing agents reproduce new individuals bound by the conditions of the environment. Furthermore, we incorporate a real-time evolutionary algorithm and show that reinforcement learning enhances the evolution of the agents' physical properties such as speed, attack and resilience against attacks.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning", "Predator-Prey Ecosystem", "Simulation of complex systems"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptive behavior", "Computational biology", "Dynamical properties", "Individual agent", "Mathematical tools", "Multi agent", "Multi agent simulation", "Predator-prey ecosystem"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85093828160", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"57219507980": {"Name": "Yamada J.", "AuthorID": "57219507980", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Emotech Labs"}, "53263658800": {"Name": "Fountas Z.", "AuthorID": "53263658800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Emotech Labs"}, "7003290763": {"Name": "Shawe-Taylor J.", "AuthorID": "7003290763", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
