Given a vast array of possible referents, how does the child know what a word refers to? We contend that onomatopoeia (e.g. knock, meow), where a word's sound evokes the sound properties associated with its meaning, are particularly useful in children's early vocabulary development, offering a link between word and sensory experience not present in arbitrary forms. We suggest that, because onomatopoeia evoke imagery of the referent, children can draw from sensory experience to easily link onomatopoeic words to meaning, both when the referent is present as well as when it is absent. We use two sources of data: naturalistic observations of English-speaking caregiver\u2013child interactions from 14 up to 54 months, to establish whether these words are present early in caregivers\u2019 speech to children, and experimental data to test whether English-speaking children can learn from onomatopoeia when it is present. Our results demonstrate that onomatopoeia: (a) are most prevalent in early child-directed language and in children's early productions, (b) are learnt more easily by children compared with non-iconic forms and (c) are used by caregivers in contexts where they can support communication and facilitate word learning.", "AuthorKeywords": ["child-directed language", "onomatopoeia", "sound symbolism", "word learning"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85097095936", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"57205108135": {"Name": "Motamedi Y.", "AuthorID": "57205108135", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Language Evolution, The University of Edinburgh"}, "57199089411": {"Name": "Murgiano M.", "AuthorID": "57199089411", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "23037837300": {"Name": "Wonnacott E.", "AuthorID": "23037837300", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, University of Oxford"}, "55919485500": {"Name": "Vigliocco G.", "AuthorID": "55919485500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "16042914700": {"Name": "Perniss P.", "AuthorID": "16042914700", "AffiliationID": "60024025", "AffiliationName": "University of Cologne"}, "7201903216": {"Name": "Marshall C.", "AuthorID": "7201903216", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}, "7004380699": {"Name": "Goldin-Meadow S.", "AuthorID": "7004380699", "AffiliationID": "60029278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Chicago"}}}
