A key challenge is to certify whether the simulator truly mimics the Hamiltonian of interest. This certification step requires the comparison of a simulator's output to a known answer, which is usually limited to small systems due to the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space. Here, in the context of Fermi-Hubbard spin-based analog simulators, we propose a modular many-body spin to charge conversion scheme that scales linearly with both the system size and the number of low-energy eigenstates to discriminate. Our protocol is based on the global charge state measurement of a 1D spin chain performed at different detuning potentials along the chain. In the context of semiconductor-based systems, we identify realistic conditions for detuning the chain adiabatically to avoid state mixing while preserving charge coherence. Large simulators with vanishing energy gaps, including 2D arrays, can be certified block-by-block with a number of measurements scaling only linearly with the system size.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Analog simulators", "Block by blocks", "Energy eigenstates", "Engineered devices", "Quantum simulators", "Quantum system", "Realistic conditions", "Small systems"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085843831", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"8958172800": {"Name": "Bayat A.", "AuthorID": "8958172800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7401626610": {"Name": "Bose S.", "AuthorID": "7401626610", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "54685294700": {"Name": "Voisin B.", "AuthorID": "54685294700", "AffiliationID": "60028333, 60160443", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, School of Physics, University of New South Wales"}, "15758899800": {"Name": "Buchs G.", "AuthorID": "15758899800", "AffiliationID": "60028333, 60160443", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, School of Physics, University of New South Wales"}, "15760896300": {"Name": "Salfi J.", "AuthorID": "15760896300", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia"}, "6701628868": {"Name": "Rogge S.", "AuthorID": "6701628868", "AffiliationID": "60028333, 60160443", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, School of Physics, University of New South Wales"}}}
