In this paper, we extend the previous studies of the effect of wind forcing on this instability to water waves in finite depth and in two horizontal space dimensions. The principal finding is that the instability is enhanced and becomes super-exponential and that the domain of instability in the modulation wavenumber space is enlarged. Since the outcome of modulation instability is expected to be the generation of rogue waves, represented within the framework of the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation as a Peregrine breather, we also examine the effect of wind forcing on a Peregrine breather. We find that the breather amplitude will grow at twice the rate of a linear instability.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Deep-water waves", "Dinger equation", "Linear instabilities", "Modulation instabilities", "Space dimensions", "Super-exponential", "Two dimensional modulations", "Wavenumber spaces"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074042939", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"]], "AuthorData": {"35462748600": {"Name": "Grimshaw R.", "AuthorID": "35462748600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
