Knowledge of the bonding of acetate/acetic acid to this substrate is needed to aid interpretation of the photocatalytic data. In this work we use ambient pressure near edge X-ray absorption fine structure to measure the coverage and geometry of acetate in the TiO2(110) contact layer as well as acetic acid in an additional layer. A saturation coverage of 0.5 monolayers in both layers is found up to an acetic acid pressure of 10\u22121 Torr at 266 K. The geometry of acetate appears to be unchanged by adsorption of an additional layer of acetic acid, with the contact layer involving a majority acetate species bidentate bonded to neighboring Ti5c sites and a minority acetate species bonded in a perpendicular geometry. Acetic acid has a similar geometry dictated by hydrogen bonding to the contact layer as well as the substrate.", "AuthorKeywords": ["acetic acid", "ambient pressure photoemission, NEXAFS", "Model photocatalysis", "rutile TiO2(110)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acetate species", "Ambient pressures", "Contact layers", "Near edge X-ray absorption fine structures", "Perpendicular geometries", "Photo catalytic degradation", "Photo-catalytic", "Saturation coverage"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085499738", "SubjectAreas": [["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Surfaces and Interfaces", "PHYS", "3110"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"55626737000": {"Name": "Dover C.M.", "AuthorID": "55626737000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "36551074300": {"Name": "Grinter D.C.", "AuthorID": "36551074300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "35423002700": {"Name": "Yim C.M.", "AuthorID": "35423002700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "57196232691": {"Name": "Thornton G.", "AuthorID": "57196232691", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "7003387644": {"Name": "Muryn C.A.", "AuthorID": "7003387644", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry and Photon Science Institute, The University of Manchester"}, "56727849100": {"Name": "Bluhm H.", "AuthorID": "56727849100", "AffiliationID": "60007174, 60026215", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"}, "24318371900": {"Name": "Salmeron M.", "AuthorID": "24318371900", "AffiliationID": "60007174", "AffiliationName": "Chemical Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"}}}
