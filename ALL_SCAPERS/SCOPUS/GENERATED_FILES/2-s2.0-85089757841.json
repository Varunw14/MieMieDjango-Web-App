All rights reserved..In postnatal life, the neuroendocrine network between the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland is responsible for the regulation of essential functions such as growth, puberty, reproduction, salt and water balance, response to stress, metabolism, and homeostasis, as well as behavior and higher cognitive functions. The fetal hypothalamo-pituitary (H-P) neuroendocrine system develops early in gestation and is greatly affected by the placenta, which itself is a dynamic endocrine system unique to the state of pregnancy. The developing H-P axis plays an important modulating role on other fetal organ systems, as well as preparing the fetus for extrauterine life. Although there is limited direct evidence for the processes inherent in H-P development in humans, the process is highly conserved across vertebrates, and development of the pituitary gland in rodent models has been particularly well characterized. In early neonatal life, the H-P axis displays a unique pattern of secretion of the various hormones, and it may be affected in pathological conditions such as prematurity and low birth weight.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fetus", "Hypothalamus", "Low birth weight", "Neonate", "Neuroendocrinology", "Pituitary", "Placental hormones", "Prematurity", "Programming"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089757841", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"6504369520": {"Name": "Katugampola H.", "AuthorID": "6504369520", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "35329107200": {"Name": "Cerbone M.", "AuthorID": "35329107200", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7003534902": {"Name": "Dattani M.T.", "AuthorID": "7003534902", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}}}
