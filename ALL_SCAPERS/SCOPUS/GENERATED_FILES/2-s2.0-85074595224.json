Following Heathcoat\u2019s 1809 bobbin-net invention, the formation of a machine-made lace industry in the East Midlands and elsewhere was driven by the men who operated the machines, the \u201ctwisthands.\u201d But they were assisted by boy, who were expected to replace and refill the bobbins, and by women and girls who did most of the mending, embroidery, finishing, dressing, bleaching, and dyeing of the lace, much of it in the dark and damp rooms of houses. Working hours were long and toil was exhausting from a very early age. Although female lace workers featured prominently in local struggles, and were often highly skilled, they were nevertheless restricted to low-paid positions in the trade because of gendered notions of skill and occupation. When in 1841 Parliament discussed child labor, the regulation of hours was rejected for lace because of its domestic nature and because of competition from across the Channel. In the Calais area, British lace-makers had developed an industry much like that in Britain. But France was a different country, with a smaller-scale economy, and as a result was characterized less by the separation between home and work and the male breadwinner model. This article examines machine-made lace in view of the historical literature on the part played by women and children in industrialization in both countries. It focuses on the gendered segregation of the work and the respective wages of men, women, and children on both sides of the Channel.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Calais", "child labor", "female labor", "lace-making", "migrants", "Nottingham", "wages"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074595224", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"]], "AuthorData": {"26034286000": {"Name": "Bensimon F.", "AuthorID": "26034286000", "AffiliationID": "60001422", "AffiliationName": "Sorbonne Universit\u00e9"}}}
