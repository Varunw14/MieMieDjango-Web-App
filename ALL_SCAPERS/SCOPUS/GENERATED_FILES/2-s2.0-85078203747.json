Therefore good configurations of software development teams can be an important factor, as effective allocation and completion of tasks may result in a more effective activity (i.e. changing configurations after an issue is reopened). To validate this assumption, we present an exploratory study on software team member configuration when resolving issues. We mine the JIRA issue tracking system to assess whether different team member configurations are quicker to resolve issues after being reopened. In a case study of Moodle, our results confirm that the combinations of team members in different roles correlate with reopened issues and the changing of team members is found to resolve those reopened issues. Moreover, the study shows that the issue type is an important factor when assigning team members.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Issue Tracking Systems", "Reopened Issues", "Team Member Configuration"], "IndexKeywords": ["Development activity", "Exploratory studies", "Issue Tracking", "Open source projects", "Reopened Issues", "Software development teams", "Team effectiveness", "Team members"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078203747", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"]], "AuthorData": {"57215115832": {"Name": "Assavakamhaenghan N.", "AuthorID": "57215115832", "AffiliationID": "60012718", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Mahidol University"}, "36661820900": {"Name": "Choetkiertikul M.", "AuthorID": "36661820900", "AffiliationID": "60012718", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Mahidol University"}, "43661605700": {"Name": "Tuarob S.", "AuthorID": "43661605700", "AffiliationID": "60012718", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Mahidol University"}, "56422351700": {"Name": "Ragkhitwetsagul C.", "AuthorID": "56422351700", "AffiliationID": "60012718", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Mahidol University"}, "24832071800": {"Name": "Sunetnanta T.", "AuthorID": "24832071800", "AffiliationID": "60012718", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Mahidol University"}, "35422373200": {"Name": "Kula R.G.", "AuthorID": "35422373200", "AffiliationID": "60025017", "AffiliationName": "Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST)"}, "24445001100": {"Name": "Hata H.", "AuthorID": "24445001100", "AffiliationID": "60025017", "AffiliationName": "Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST)"}, "55378267900": {"Name": "Matsumoto K.", "AuthorID": "55378267900", "AffiliationID": "60025017", "AffiliationName": "Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST)"}}}
