All rights reserved.Specific, peripheral C-tactile afferents contribute to the perception of tactile pleasure, but the brain areas involved in their processing remain debated. We report the first human lesion study on the perception of C-tactile touch in right hemisphere stroke patients (N = 59), revealing that right posterior and anterior insula lesions reduce tactile, contralateral and ipsilateral pleasantness sensitivity, respectively. These findings corroborate previous imaging studies regarding the role of the posterior insula in the perception of affective touch. However, our findings about the crucial role of the anterior insula for ipsilateral affective touch perception open new avenues of enquiry regarding the cortical organization of this tactile system.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Affective touch", "CT system", "Insula", "Interoception", "Lesion mapping"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079158335", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"36134441100": {"Name": "Kirsch L.P.", "AuthorID": "36134441100", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60069769", "AffiliationName": "Institut des Syst\u00e8mes Intelligents et de Robotique, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9"}, "57214801573": {"Name": "Papadaki C.", "AuthorID": "57214801573", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College"}, "55879967300": {"Name": "Crucianelli L.", "AuthorID": "55879967300", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet"}, "26767738700": {"Name": "Fotopoulou A.", "AuthorID": "26767738700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College"}, "56221801500": {"Name": "Besharati S.", "AuthorID": "56221801500", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "The Department of Psychology, University of the Witwatersrand"}, "57194189297": {"Name": "Bertagnoli S.", "AuthorID": "57194189297", "AffiliationID": "60032256", "AffiliationName": "NPSY.Lab-VR, Department of Human Sciences, University of Verona"}, "6603640267": {"Name": "Moro V.", "AuthorID": "6603640267", "AffiliationID": "60032256", "AffiliationName": "NPSY.Lab-VR, Department of Human Sciences, University of Verona"}, "7102178423": {"Name": "Ward N.", "AuthorID": "7102178423", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6701922411": {"Name": "Jenkinson P.M.", "AuthorID": "6701922411", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, School of Life and Medical Sciences, University of Hertfordshire"}}}
