All rights reserved.The role of appetite in obesity has been studied for over 50 years, but until the 21st century this research focused largely on adults. More recently, researchers have made important strides in evidencing the importance of appetite for risk of both over- and underweight in childhood. The behavioral susceptibility theory of obesity hypothesizes that genetically determined individual differences in appetite cause people to respond differently to the modern \u201cobesogenic\u201d food environment. These differences in appetite confer greater or lower risk of excess weight gain. Evidence from large population based cohort studies has demonstrated that, from early life, appetite is under considerable genetic influence, children display large individual differences in appetitive behaviors, and that these differences prospectively predict early weight gain. This chapter describes the evidence base for Behavioural Susceptibility Theory, and its implications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Appetite", "Behavioral susceptibility", "Child", "Eating behavior", "Emotional overeating", "Food responsiveness", "Genetic risk", "Infant", "Obesity", "Overweight", "Pediatric", "Satiety"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079253022", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"24471042200": {"Name": "Llewellyn C.H.", "AuthorID": "24471042200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "54414058400": {"Name": "Fildes A.", "AuthorID": "54414058400", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "University of Leeds"}}}
