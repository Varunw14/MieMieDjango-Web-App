Here we characterize an interaction between regulators of circadian entrainment, output, and synaptic development in Drosophila that influences clock-driven anticipatory increases in morning and evening activity. We previously showed the JETLAG (JET) E3 ubiquitin ligase resets the clock upon light exposure, whereas the PDZ protein DYSCHRONIC (DYSC) regulates circadian locomotor output and synaptic development. Surprisingly, we find that JET and DYSC antagonistically regulate synaptic development at the larval neuromuscular junction, and reduced JET activity rescues arrhythmicity of dysc mutants. Consistent with our prior finding that DYSC regulates SLOWPOKE (SLO) potassium channel expression, jet mutations also rescue circadian and synaptic phenotypes in slo mutants. Collectively, our data suggest that JET, DYSC, and SLO promote circadian output in part by regulating synaptic morphology.\u00a9 2020 The Author(s)Chronobiology; Developmental Biology; Developmental Neuroscience", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chronobiology", "Developmental Biology", "Developmental Neuroscience"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078667470", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"51764034600": {"Name": "Lamaze A.", "AuthorID": "51764034600", "AffiliationID": "60015277", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience and the Farber Institute for Neurosciences, Thomas Jefferson University"}, "24577637600": {"Name": "Jepson J.", "AuthorID": "24577637600", "AffiliationID": "60015277", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience and the Farber Institute for Neurosciences, Thomas Jefferson University"}, "57214332545": {"Name": "Akpoghiran O.", "AuthorID": "57214332545", "AffiliationID": "60015277", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience and the Farber Institute for Neurosciences, Thomas Jefferson University"}, "14025798500": {"Name": "Koh K.", "AuthorID": "14025798500", "AffiliationID": "60015277", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience and the Farber Institute for Neurosciences, Thomas Jefferson University"}}}
