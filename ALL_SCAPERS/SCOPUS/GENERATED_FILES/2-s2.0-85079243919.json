Currently, there is no practical method to control this disease. Therefore, we have explored the development of a novel vaccine-based method to control this disease using transgenic algae. During infection by white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), the interaction between viral envelope proteins and cell surface protein receptors on target cells is the key step of viral entry and replication. Hence, transgenic lines of the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii harbouring a WSSV VP28 viral envelope protein were created as an oral delivery system for vaccinating shrimp. Two separate transplastomic lines containing wild-type and codon optimized gene sequences for VP28 were evaluated for recombinant protein levels. Only the codon optimized line gave rise to detectable VP28 in western blot analysis, which demonstrated that optimization for chloroplast codon bias improved the efficiency of expression and that the gene design produced a favourable RNA secondary structure with suitable free energy for translation. In addition, bile salt and acid tolerance tests demonstrated that this transgenic Chlamydomonas can tolerate mildly acidic (pH 5.0) conditions and 0.30% bile salts. These features indicated that algal cells are suitable for delivering viral antigens through a shrimp's digestive system. In WSSV infection experiments, the highest survival rate (87%) was recorded in shrimps fed with the codon optimized VP28 line mixed into their feed, indicating that this line could be employed in the control of WSSV spread in shrimp populations. This algal strategy offers a new, efficient, fast and less labour-intensive method for the control of other diseases in aquatic animals through oral delivery.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chlamydomonas reinhardtii", "Chloroplast genetic engineering", "Oral delivery system", "Transgenic algae", "White spot syndrome virus"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079243919", "SubjectAreas": [["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"]], "AuthorData": {"57214825456": {"Name": "Kiataramgul A.", "AuthorID": "57214825456", "AffiliationID": "60021944", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Kasetsart University"}, "57214823721": {"Name": "Maneenin S.", "AuthorID": "57214823721", "AffiliationID": "60021944", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Kasetsart University"}, "6507647235": {"Name": "Unajak S.", "AuthorID": "6507647235", "AffiliationID": "60021944", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Kasetsart University"}, "6701719502": {"Name": "Purton S.", "AuthorID": "6701719502", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Algal Research Group, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "7801563895": {"Name": "Areechon N.", "AuthorID": "7801563895", "AffiliationID": "60021944", "AffiliationName": "Department of Aquaculture, Faculty of Fisheries, Kasetsart University"}, "57204043351": {"Name": "Hirono I.", "AuthorID": "57204043351", "AffiliationID": "60018357", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Marine Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology"}, "55542763300": {"Name": "Brocklehurst T.W.", "AuthorID": "55542763300", "AffiliationID": "60018809", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Silpakorn University"}}}
