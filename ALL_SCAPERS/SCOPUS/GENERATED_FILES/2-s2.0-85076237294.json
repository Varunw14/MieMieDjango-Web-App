The study involved extensive 2-week microbiological environmental monitoring of an entire ward before and after cleaning; the ward was located within a pediatric hematology-oncology ward comprised of a day unit and outpatient ward. Methods: Tryptone soya agar contact plates were used to take a total of 1,160 surface samples before and after cleaning from 55 predetermined sites. Samples were taken from representative surfaces throughout the ward representing a variety of materials, surface heights, functions, and distances from patients, as well as both high-touch and infrequently touched surfaces. Results: After surface cleaning was undertaken within the ward, there was a significant difference between the amount of colony-forming units (CFUs) recovered before and after cleaning (P <.0001). Cleaning produced an average CFU reduction of 68% throughout the ward environment. The corridor was the most contaminated area within the ward. There were differences in the CFUs among the various areas within the ward, which were cleaned with varying efficiency. The surface material, who interacted with the surface, levels of initial contamination, perceived risk, and perceived cleanability were all found to have a varying impact on the cleaning effectiveness. Conclusions: To the authors\u2019 current knowledge, this is the only study to assess cleaning within a pediatric ward by taking samples directly before and after cleaning. The standard of cleaning undertaken within the ward is open for discussion, and these data highlight the need for an improved cleaning intervention and can provide insight into the multitude of factors that must be considered when designing an effective training protocol.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cleaning", "Environmental monitoring", "Health care\u2013associated infections", "Hospital", "Infection prevention and control", "Surface sampling"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076237294", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57211023910": {"Name": "Rawlinson S.", "AuthorID": "57211023910", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "40661103700": {"Name": "Cloutman-Green E.", "AuthorID": "40661103700", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Camelia Botnar Laboratories, Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "18435943500": {"Name": "Ciric L.", "AuthorID": "18435943500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "57212220309": {"Name": "Asadi F.", "AuthorID": "57212220309", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Camelia Botnar Laboratories, Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
