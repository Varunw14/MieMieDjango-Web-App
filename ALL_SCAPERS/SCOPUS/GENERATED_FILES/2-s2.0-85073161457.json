Religious and communal identity appear as the driving force behind the micro-dynamics in Stamford Hill, allow relatively small Hasidic groups living close to the city centre to reproduce their physical proximity in space, and maintain their communal identity. Considering the high fertility rates and high residential demands, the council is limited in supporting the Hasidic communities\u2019 housing needs. More specifically, we could expect micro-segregation mechanisms to operate in multicultural urban hubs as a result of people\u2019s urge to feel comfortable in their residential surroundings. The housing shortage at Stamford Hill prompted the Satmar community to initiate a group action and send pioneers to settle in the peripheral area of Canvey Island. The quality of life, in terms of living conditions and housing prices, is significantly higher than in the old enclave, with a relatively low density of two persons per room, and the construction irregularities are negligible. Despite the concern of the veteran residents of the implications of the entry of newcomers on the composition of the community and house prices, the support of the local authority increases the chances of Canvey Island to become a model of harmonious standalone coexistence. The micro-segregation pattern of the Satmar community in Stamford Hill and around JCoCI in Canvey Island suggests that seemingly homogeneous inner-city neighbourhoods actually include subareas created by religious, social or cultural relations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Community discipline", "Community support mechanisms", "Construction irregularities", "Group action", "Living conditions", "Non-economic segregation", "Overdensity", "Religious and communal identity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073161457", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"55536712300": {"Name": "Flint Ashery S.", "AuthorID": "55536712300", "AffiliationID": "60002765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography and Environment, Bar Ilan University"}}}
