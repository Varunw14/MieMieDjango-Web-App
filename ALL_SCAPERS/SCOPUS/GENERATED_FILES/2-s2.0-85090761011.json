Here, we investigate the photo-induced dynamics of a prototypical strongly-coupled molecular exciton-microcavity system using broadband two-dimensional Fourier transform spectroscopy and unravel the mechanistic details of its ultrafast photo-induced dynamics. We find evidence for a direct energy relaxation pathway from the upper to the lower polariton state that initially bypasses the excitonic manifold of states, which is often assumed to act as an intermediate energy reservoir, under certain experimental conditions. This observation provides new insight into polariton photophysics and could potentially aid the development of applications that rely on controlling the energy relaxation mechanism, such as in solar energy harvesting, manipulating chemical reactivity, the creation of Bose\u2013Einstein condensates and quantum computing.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Controlled manipulations", "Einstein condensate", "Electromagnetic modes", "Energy relaxation mechanisms", "Experimental conditions", "Intermediate energies", "Lower polariton state", "Two-dimensional fourier transform spectroscopies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090761011", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56904259500": {"Name": "Mewes L.", "AuthorID": "56904259500", "AffiliationID": "60117644, 60019722", "AffiliationName": "Dynamische Spektroskopien, Fakult\u00e4t f\u00fcr Chemie, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"}, "57073033200": {"Name": "Ingle R.A.", "AuthorID": "57073033200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57203028914": {"Name": "Chergui M.", "AuthorID": "57203028914", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Spectroscopie Ultrarapide and Lausanne Centre for Ultrafast Science, Institut des Sciences et Ing\u00e9nierie Chimique, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, ISIC"}, "57205669059": {"Name": "Wang M.", "AuthorID": "57205669059", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Gothenburg"}, "7801496544": {"Name": "B\u00f6rjesson K.", "AuthorID": "7801496544", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Gothenburg"}}}
