Design/methodology/approach: The paper draws on literature relating to disaster management to suggest that translation is a perennial issue in crisis communication. Findings: Although communication with multicultural and multilinguistic communities is seen as being in urgent need of attention, the authors find that the role of translation in enabling this is underestimated, if not unrecognized. Originality/value: This paper raises awareness of the need for urgent attention to be given by scholars and practitioners to the role of translation in crisis communication.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Crisis communication", "Cross-cultural barriers", "Emergency responses", "Linguistic vulnerability", "Translation studies"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072112655", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"15925957200": {"Name": "O\u2019Brien S.", "AuthorID": "15925957200", "AffiliationID": "60025059", "AffiliationName": "School of Applied Language and Intercultural Studies, Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, Dublin City University"}, "55885143600": {"Name": "Federici F.M.", "AuthorID": "55885143600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Translation Studies, University College London"}}}
