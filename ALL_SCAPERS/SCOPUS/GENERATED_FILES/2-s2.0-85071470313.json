METHODS: We updated a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies on the sensitivities, specificities, predictive values, diagnostic odds ratios and areas under the curve for index tests. The analysis was conducted using the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic method in R software. RESULTS: We included 24 publications in the systematic review and meta-analysis. 'Any CXR abnormality' had the highest sensitivity (94.1%, 95%CI 85.8-97.7) among all index tests. 'CXR abnormality suggestive of TB' had a higher specificity (92.2%, 95%CI 89.7-94.1) than 'any CXR abnormality' (86.8%, 95%CI 79.7-91.7). The sensitivity for 'any TB symptom' was 73.0% (95%CI 64.1-80.4), while 'prolonged cough' of \u22652 weeks had a specificity of 94.3% (95%CI 92.2-95.9). There was no significant difference in the sensitivity and specificity of all screening tools stratified by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) settings, with the exception of 'CXR abnormality suggestive of TB', which had a significantly higher sensitivity in low than in high HIV prevalence settings (effect estimate 2.26, 95%CI 0.69-3.82; P \u00bc 0.002). CONCLUSION: In countries with a high TB burden, the absence of any TB symptom and any CXR abnormality can be used to exclude active pulmonary TB before initiating treatment for LTBI in household contacts aged \u22655 years of patients with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Excluding active tuberculosis", "High tuberculosis countries", "Latent tuberculous infection", "Screening tools", "Tuberculosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Developing Countries", "Family Characteristics", "Humans", "Mass Screening", "Prevalence", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Tuberculosis, Pulmonary"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071470313", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57192153780": {"Name": "Hamada Y.", "AuthorID": "57192153780", "AffiliationID": "60027142", "AffiliationName": "Global Tuberculosis Programme, World Health Organization"}, "55886401400": {"Name": "Getahun H.", "AuthorID": "55886401400", "AffiliationID": "60027142", "AffiliationName": "Global Tuberculosis Programme, World Health Organization"}, "22949673500": {"Name": "Assefa Y.", "AuthorID": "22949673500", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Health, University of Queensland"}, "57195461619": {"Name": "Woldeyohannes S.", "AuthorID": "57195461619", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Health, University of Queensland"}, "56426241300": {"Name": "Gelaw Y.A.", "AuthorID": "56426241300", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Health, University of Queensland"}}}
