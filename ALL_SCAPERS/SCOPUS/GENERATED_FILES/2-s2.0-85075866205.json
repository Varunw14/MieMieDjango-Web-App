Particular utilisations largely depend upon the sensitivity of the dosimetric medium. In present work the thermoluminescent dosimetric properties of commercial low-cost borosilicate glass slides and glass-fibre filters were characterized, use being made initially of a 250 kV clinical therapy x-beam facility. From this, reproducibility and linearity were determined for radiation doses of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 Gy. Reproducibility of +/5% was obtained following appropriate screening, excellent linearity to dose also being demonstrated for both the borosilicate glass slides and glass-fibre filters, sufficient to demonstrate the potential of these media for use in radiotherapy dosimetry. Of note is the appreciable but not unsurprising dose response of the nominal 1.0 mm thickness borosilicate glass slides, with a per unit dose response some twice that of the less substantial glass-fibre filters. Further work has characterized the borosilicate glass slides for the megavoltage photons and electrons produced by linacs. A further potential interest results from the boron content, recognizing the associated appreciable neutron cross-sections. It is posited that the additional response observed at 10 MV over that at 6 MV is partly a result of photo-neutron production, a matter that is expected to form the basis of further investigations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Borosilicate glass", "Dosimetry", "Radiotherapy", "Thermoluminescence"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dosimetric properties", "Environmental radiation", "Industrial irradiation", "Megavoltage photons", "Neutron cross sections", "Neutron production", "Thermoluminescence dosimetry", "Thermoluminescent dosimeters"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075866205", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"]], "AuthorData": {"57212082145": {"Name": "Alqahtani A.", "AuthorID": "57212082145", "AffiliationID": "60104334", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine, University of Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal"}, "7403122642": {"Name": "Bradley D.A.", "AuthorID": "7403122642", "AffiliationID": "60107208", "AffiliationName": "Sunway University, Centre for Biomedical Physics, Jalan Universiti"}, "57212083644": {"Name": "Alanizi A.", "AuthorID": "57212083644", "AffiliationID": "116240831", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics Department, Cancer Centre, Prince Mohammed Medical City"}, "7005065727": {"Name": "Nisbet A.", "AuthorID": "7005065727", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics & Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
