Urol.", "Volume": "78", "Issue": 4, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 503, "PageEnd": 511, "CitedBy": 7, "DOI": "10.1016/j.eururo.2020.03.002", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85083328457&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2020Background: Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MP-MRI) is established in the diagnosis of prostate cancer, but the need for enhanced sequences has recently been questioned. Objective: To assess whether dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging (DCE) improves accuracy over T2 and diffusion sequences. Design, setting, and participants: PROMIS was a multicentre, multireader trial, with, in this part, 497 biopsy-na\u00efve men undergoing standardised 1.5T MP-MRI using T2, diffusion, and DCE, followed by a detailed transperineal prostate mapping (TPM) biopsy at 5 mm intervals. Likert scores of 1\u20135 for the presence of a significant tumour were assigned in strict sequence, for (1) T2 + diffusion and then (2) T2 + diffusion + dynamic contrast-enhanced images. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: For the primary analysis, the primary PROMIS outcome measure (Gleason score \u22654 + 3 or \u22656 mm maximum cancer length) on TPM was used, and an MRI score of \u22653 was considered positive. Results and limitations: Sensitivity without and with DCE was 94% and 95%, specificity 37% and 38%, positive predictive value 51% and 51%, and negative predictive value 90% and 91%, respectively (p > 0.05 in each case). The number of patients avoiding biopsy (scoring 1\u20132) was similar (123/497 vs 121/497, p = 0.8). The number of equivocal scores (3/5) was slightly higher without DCE (32% vs 28% p = 0.031). The proportion of MRI equivocal (3/5) and positive (4\u20135) cases showing significant tumours were similar (23% and 71% vs 20% and 69%). No cases of dominant Gleason 4 or higher were missed with DCE, compared with a single case with T2 + diffusion-weighted imaging. No attempt was made to correlate lesion location on MRI and histology, which may be considered a limitation. Radiologists were aware of the patient's prostate-specific antigen. Conclusions: Contrast adds little when MP-MRI is used to exclude significant prostate cancer. Patient summary: An intravenous injection of contrast may not be necessary when magnetic resonance imaging is used as a test to rule out significant tumours in the prostate.\u00a9 2020The addition of dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging did not offer a statistically significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy compared with T2 + diffusion sequences alone, although there was a marginal reduction of equivocal (3/5) magnetic resonance imaging results.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biparametric magnetic resonance imaging", "Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging", "Prostate cancer", "Prostate magnetic
