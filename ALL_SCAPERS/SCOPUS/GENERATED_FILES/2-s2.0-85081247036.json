Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdAims: Oral and/or oropharyngeal acute mucositis during and after chemo-radiotherapy (chemo-RT) for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) can be extremely painful, sometimes requiring nasogastric feeding to enable adequate nutrition. The MASCC/ISOO evidence-based guidelines recommend benzydamine mouthwash for mucositis prevention in RT (recently updated to include chemo-RT), and a Cochrane systematic review found other agents to be effective in prophylaxis. Diclofenac mouthwash is licensed for painful oral mucosal inflammatory conditions but to our knowledge has not been assessed in chemo-RT\u2013associated oral mucositis. Method: A clinical observation and service evaluation study in 10 patients undergoing chemo-RT for HNSCC to assess the potential value of diclofenac mouthwash (0.74 mg/mL) in reducing symptoms. Patients used 20ml of mouthwash up to 4 times a day starting in week 3 (of a 6-week course of treatment), recording pain and discomfort scores using a visual analogue scale on days 0, 1,7 and 14 (until the end of week 4). As per our current clinical practice, oral mucositis was not clinically scored as an outcome. Statistical analysis was performed using a one-way ANOVA. Results: Using diclofenac mouthwash, 9/10 patients experienced pain score reduction from day 0 (mean score 6.75 \u00b1 SD 1.83) to day 2 (5.05 \u00b1 SD 1.62) and day 14 (4.09 \u00b1 SD 1.96). Conclusions: Diclofenac mouthwash may be beneficial for managing chemo-RT\u2013induced oral mucositis. While a prospective randomised clinical trial is needed, it can be prescribed for this condition within its current licence.", "AuthorKeywords": ["diclofenac", "mouthwash", "oral mucositis", "pilot study", "radiotherapy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chemoradiotherapy", "Diclofenac", "Head and Neck Neoplasms", "Humans", "Mouthwashes", "Pain", "Prospective Studies", "Radiation Injuries", "Stomatitis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081247036", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Oral Surgery", "DENT", "3504"], ["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"], ["Periodontics", "DENT", "3506"]], "AuthorData": {"7402304465": {"Name": "Brennan P.A.", "AuthorID": "7402304465", "AffiliationID": "60030999", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Queen Alexandra Hospital"}, "55819008900": {"Name": "Lewthwaite R.", "AuthorID": "55819008900", "AffiliationID": "60030999", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Queen Alexandra Hospital"}, "57215584197": {"Name": "Sakthithasan P.", "AuthorID": "57215584197", "AffiliationID": "60030999", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Queen Alexandra Hospital"}, "57215585306": {"Name": "McGuigan S.", "AuthorID": "57215585306", "AffiliationID": "60030999", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Queen Alexandra Hospital"}, "56638040400": {"Name": "Alam P.", "AuthorID": "56638040400", "AffiliationID": "60030999", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Queen Alexandra Hospital"}, "57215592500": {"Name": "Donnelly O.", "AuthorID": "57215592500", "AffiliationID": "60030999", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Oncology, Queen Alexandra Hospital"}, "7402250311": {"Name": "Gomez R.S.", "AuthorID": "7402250311", "AffiliationID": "60030074", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oral Surgery and Pathology, School of Dentistry, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"}, "7004087651": {"Name": "Fedele S.", "AuthorID": "7004087651", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "NIHR University College London Hospital Biomedical Research Centre"}}}
