We evaluated differences in healthcare resource utilization and costs between Federico II and Vanvitelli MS Centres of Naples (Italy), representative of centralised (i.e., MS Care Unit) and local service-based models of multidisciplinary care, respectively. Methods We included MS patients continuously seen at the same local healthcare services and MS Centre (Federico II = 187; Vanvitelli = 90) from 2015 to 2017. Healthcare resources for MS treatment and management were collected and costs were calculated. Adherence was estimated as the rate of medication possession ratio (MPR) during 3-years of follow-up. Mixed-effect linear regression models were used to estimate differences in all outcomes between Federico II and Vanvitelli. Results Patients at Federico II had more consultations within the MS centre (p<0.001), blood tests (p<0.001), and psychological/cognitive evaluations (p = 0.040). Patients at Vanvitelli had more consultations at local services (p<0.001). Adherence was not-significantly lower at Vanvitelli (p = 0.060), compared with Federico II. Costs for MS treatment and management were 10.6% lower at Vanvitelli (12417.08\u00b18448.32EUR) (95%CI = -19.0/-2.7%;p = 0.007), compared with Federico II (15318.57\u00b110919.59EUR). Discussion Healthcare services were more complete (and expensive) at the Federico II centralised MS Care Unit, compared with the Vanvitelli local service-based organizational model. Future research should evaluate whether better integration between MS Centres and local services can lead to improved MS management and lower costs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Delivery of Health Care", "Female", "Health Care Costs", "Health Services", "Humans", "Immunologic Factors", "Italy", "Linear Models", "Male", "Medication Adherence", "Middle Aged", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Retrospective Studies", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072331485", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"36461391900": {"Name": "Moccia M.", "AuthorID": "36461391900", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Queen Square MS Centre, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57206717484": {"Name": "Lanzillo R.", "AuthorID": "57206717484", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Multiple Sclerosis Clinical Care and Research Centre, Department of Neuroscience, Reproductive Science and Odontostomatology, \u201cFederico II\u201d University"}, "57219717804": {"Name": "Morra V.B.", "AuthorID": "57219717804", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Multiple Sclerosis Clinical Care and Research Centre, Department of Neuroscience, Reproductive Science and Odontostomatology, \u201cFederico II\u201d University"}, "57211035238": {"Name": "Tajani A.", "AuthorID": "57211035238", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, \u201cFederico II\u201d University"}, "24463684400": {"Name": "Pennino F.", "AuthorID": "24463684400", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, \u201cFederico II\u201d University"}, "57215205417": {"Name": "Palladino R.", "AuthorID": "57215205417", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Public Health, Imperial College"}, "7004289116": {"Name": "Triassi M.", "AuthorID": "7004289116", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, \u201cFederico II\u201d University"}, "57211032974": {"Name": "Acampora R.", "AuthorID": "57211032974", "AffiliationID": "123178220", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care and Local Service Unit, Local Healthcare Services \u201cNapoli 3 Sud\u201d"}, "6504328310": {"Name": "Sergianni P.", "AuthorID": "6504328310", "AffiliationID": "123178220", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care and Local Service Unit, Local Healthcare Services \u201cNapoli 3 Sud\u201d"}, "56469571000": {"Name": "Signoriello E.", "AuthorID": "56469571000", "AffiliationID": "60026777, 60017293", "AffiliationName": "Multiple Sclerosis Centre, II Neurology Clinic, \"Luigi Vanvitelli\" University of Campania"}, "6602849093": {"Name": "Lus G.", "AuthorID": "6602849093", "AffiliationID": "60026777, 60017293", "AffiliationName": "Multiple Sclerosis Centre, II Neurology Clinic, \"Luigi Vanvitelli\" University of Campania"}, "57211032779": {"Name": "Corbisiero G.", "AuthorID": "57211032779", "AffiliationID": "123178220", "AffiliationName": "Local Healthcare Service 57, Local Healthcare Services \u201cNapoli 3 Sud\u201d"}, "57211035300": {"Name": "Vercellone A.", "AuthorID": "57211035300", "AffiliationID": "123178220", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, Local Healthcare Services \u201cNapoli 3 Sud\u201d"}, "57206657262": {"Name": "Capacchione A.", "AuthorID": "57206657262", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
