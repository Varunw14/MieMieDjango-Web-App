The concept of renormalization at the mesoscale was introduced to capture the co-operative interaction of microcracks. The maximum tensile stress criterion and the Drucker-Prager criterion (which considers all three principal stresses) were used to evaluate the damage of specimen-forming elements in tension and shear, respectively. Simulations are presented alongside experimental data to show the capabilities of the model in tackling the failure process of intact rock, with an emphasis on microcrack initiation and propagation. We demonstrate that our model is capable of simulating the initiation and propagation of microcracks in deforming rocks and captures the mechanical behavior, strength, and failure patterns seen in laboratory experiments. Our 3D model therefore emerges as a powerful tool to study the evolution of failure in brittle rocks.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Damage evolution", "Fracturing", "Inhomogeneity", "Microcracking", "Numerical model"], "IndexKeywords": ["Damage evolution", "Drucker Prager criterion", "In-laboratory experiments", "Inhomogeneities", "Initiation and propagation", "Material heterogeneity", "Meso-scale modeling", "Microcrack initiation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072626563", "SubjectAreas": [["Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology", "EART", "1909"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"57194022464": {"Name": "Zhou G.", "AuthorID": "57194022464", "AffiliationID": "60031863", "AffiliationName": "Center for Rock Instability and Seismicity Research, Northeastern University"}, "56405901400": {"Name": "Xu T.", "AuthorID": "56405901400", "AffiliationID": "60031863", "AffiliationName": "Center for Rock Instability and Seismicity Research, Northeastern University"}, "57211083889": {"Name": "Yuan Y.", "AuthorID": "57211083889", "AffiliationID": "60031863", "AffiliationName": "Center for Rock Instability and Seismicity Research, Northeastern University"}, "15753312300": {"Name": "Heap M.", "AuthorID": "15753312300", "AffiliationID": "60103368, 60059222", "AffiliationName": "G\u00e9ophysique Exp\u00e9rimentale, Institut de Physique de Globe de Strasbourg (UMR 7516 CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg/EOST)"}, "7102997852": {"Name": "Meredith P.", "AuthorID": "7102997852", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Rock & Ice Physics Laboratory, Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "39262157300": {"Name": "Mitchell T.", "AuthorID": "39262157300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Rock & Ice Physics Laboratory, Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "57211080664": {"Name": "Sesnic A.", "AuthorID": "57211080664", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Rock & Ice Physics Laboratory, Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}}}
