Publication rights licensed to ACM.Software-intensive organizations rely on large numbers of softwareassets of different types, e.g., source-code files, tables in the datawarehouse, and software configurations. Who is the most suitableowner of a given asset changes over time, e.g., due to reorganization and individual function changes. New forms of automation canhelp suggest more suitable owners for any given asset at a givenpoint in time. By such efforts on ownership health, accountabilityof ownership is increased. The problem of finding the most suitableowners for an asset is essentially a program comprehension problem: how do we automatically determine who would be best placedto understand, maintain, evolve (and thereby assume ownership of)a given asset. This paper introduces the Facebook Ownesty system,which uses a combination of ultra large scale data mining and machine learning and has been deployed at Facebook as part of thecompany's ownership management approach. Ownesty processesmany millions of software assets (e.g., source-code files) and it takesinto account workflow and organizational aspects. The paper setsout open problems and challenges on ownership for the researchcommunity with advances expected from the fields of softwareengineering, programming languages, and machine learning.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Global software engineering", "Machine learning", "Ownership"], "IndexKeywords": ["Large scale data", "Organizational aspects", "Ownership managements", "Problems and challenges", "Program comprehension", "Software assets", "Software configuration", "Source codes"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091929283", "SubjectAreas": [["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"57219259208": {"Name": "Ahlgren J.", "AuthorID": "57219259208", "AffiliationID": "60109024", "AffiliationName": "Facebook Inc."}, "57219253734": {"Name": "Berezin M.E.", "AuthorID": "57219253734", "AffiliationID": "60109024", "AffiliationName": "Facebook Inc."}, "57219256222": {"Name": "Bojarczuk K.", "AuthorID": "57219256222", "AffiliationID": "60109024", "AffiliationName": "Facebook Inc."}, "57219250896": {"Name": "Dulskyte E.", "AuthorID": "57219250896", "AffiliationID": "60109024", "AffiliationName": "Facebook Inc."}, "57219258995": {"Name": "Dvortsova I.", "AuthorID": "57219258995", "AffiliationID": "60109024", "AffiliationName": "Facebook Inc."}, "57219256870": {"Name": "George J.", "AuthorID": "57219256870", "AffiliationID": "60109024", "AffiliationName": "Facebook Inc."}, "57211133258": {"Name": "Gucevska N.", "AuthorID": "57211133258", "AffiliationID": "60109024", "AffiliationName": "Facebook Inc."}, "7006379048": {"Name": "Harman M.", "AuthorID": "7006379048", "AffiliationID": "60109024", "AffiliationName": "Facebook Inc."}, "57219254306": {"Name": "He S.", "AuthorID": "57219254306", "AffiliationID": "60109024", "AffiliationName": "Facebook Inc."}, "7004269252": {"Name": "L\u00e4mmel R.", "AuthorID": "7004269252", "AffiliationID": "60109024", "AffiliationName": "Facebook Inc."}, "57212620230": {"Name": "Meijer E.", "AuthorID": "57212620230", "AffiliationID": "60109024", "AffiliationName": "Facebook Inc."}, "57219254213": {"Name": "Sapora S.", "AuthorID": "57219254213", "AffiliationID": "60109024", "AffiliationName": "Facebook Inc."}, "57219252900": {"Name": "Spahr-Summers J.", "AuthorID": "57219252900", "AffiliationID": "60109024", "AffiliationName": "Facebook Inc."}}}
