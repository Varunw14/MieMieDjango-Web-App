We show that the variety of whiskers on a rat\u2019s cheek, each of which has different lengths and shapes, can be described by a simple mathematical equation such that each whisker is represented as an interval on the Euler spiral. When all the representative curves of mystacial vibrissae for a single rat are assembled together, they span an interval extending from one coiled domain of the Euler spiral to the other. We additionally find that each whisker makes nearly the same angle of 47\u00b0 with the normal to the spherical virtual surface formed by the tips of whiskers, which constitutes the rat\u2019s tactile sensory shroud or \u201csearch space.\u201d The implications of the linear curvature model for gaining insight into relationships between growth, form, and function are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Analytical studies", "Gaining insights", "Intrinsic shape", "Mathematical equations", "Rat whiskers", "Search spaces", "Algorithms", "Animals", "Models, Biological", "Rats", "Touch", "Vibrissae"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078108574", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"6603952854": {"Name": "Starostin E.L.", "AuthorID": "6603952854", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "8700965800": {"Name": "Goss V.G.A.", "AuthorID": "8700965800", "AffiliationID": "60031237", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, London South Bank University"}, "7005973659": {"Name": "van der Heijden G.H.M.", "AuthorID": "7005973659", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "16432541300": {"Name": "Grant R.A.", "AuthorID": "16432541300", "AffiliationID": "60022046", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biology and Conservation Ecology, Manchester Metropolitan University"}, "57191108782": {"Name": "Dougill G.", "AuthorID": "57191108782", "AffiliationID": "60022046", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biology and Conservation Ecology, Manchester Metropolitan University"}}}
