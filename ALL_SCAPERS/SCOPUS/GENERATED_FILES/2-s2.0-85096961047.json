{"Title": "SuperCLASS \u2013 III. Weak lensing from radio and optical observations in Data Release 1", "Year": 2020, "Source": "Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc.", "Volume": "495", "Issue": 2, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 1737, "PageEnd": 1759, "CitedBy": 1, "DOI": "10.1093/mnras/staa696", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85096961047&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2020 The Author(s).We describe the first results on weak gravitational lensing from the SuperCLASS survey: the first survey specifically designed to measure the weak lensing effect in radio-wavelength data, both alone and in cross-correlation with optical data. We analyse 1.53 deg2 of optical data from the Subaru telescope and 0.26 deg2 of radio data from the e-MERLIN and VLA telescopes (the DR1 data set). Using standard methodologies on the optical data only we make a significant (10\u03c3 ) detection of the weak lensing signal (a shear power spectrum) due to the massive supercluster of galaxies in the targeted region. For the radio data we develop a new method to measure the shapes of galaxies from the interferometric data, and we construct a simulation pipeline to validate this method. We then apply this analysis to our radio observations, treating the e-MERLIN and VLA data independently. We achieve source densities of 0.5 arcmin\u22122 in the VLA data and 0.06 arcmin\u22122 in the e-MERLIN data, numbers which prove too small to allow a detection of a weak lensing signal in either the radio data alone or in cross-correlation with the optical data. Finally, we show preliminary results from a visibility-plane combination of the data from e-MERLIN and VLA which will be used for the forthcoming full SuperCLASS data release. This approach to data combination is expected to enhance both the number density of weak lensing sources available, and the fidelity with which their shapes can be measured.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cosmology: observations", "Dark matter", "Gravitational lensing: weak", "Large-scale structure of Universe", "Radio continuum: galaxies"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096961047", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57190308522": {"Name": "Harrison I.", "AuthorID": "57190308522", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Oxford, Denys Wilkinson Building"}, "57205381665": {"Name": "Brown M.L.", "AuthorID": "57205381665", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Manchester"}, "57193574405": {"Name": "Tunbridge B.", "AuthorID": "57193574405", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Manchester"}, "55532216000": {"Name": "Thomas D.B.", "AuthorID": "55532216000", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Manchester"}, "57216334048": {"Name": "Hillier T.", "AuthorID": "57216334048", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Manchester"}, "37068220500": {"Name": "Thomson A.P.", "AuthorID": "37068220500", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Manchester"}, "56742951500": {"Name": "Whittaker L.", "AuthorID": "56742951500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57202570229": {"Name": "Battye R.A.", "AuthorID": "57202570229", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Manchester"}, "15057539200": {"Name": "Bonaldi A.", "AuthorID": "15057539200", "AffiliationID": "60111178", "AffiliationName": "SKA Organization, Jodrell Bank"}, "35117442400": {"Name": "Camera S.", "AuthorID": "35117442400", "AffiliationID": "60114686", "AffiliationName": "INFN \u2013 Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare, Sezione di Torino"}, "56872971400": {"Name": "Demetroullas C.", "AuthorID": "56872971400", "AffiliationID": "60077474", "AffiliationName": "Cyprus University of Technology"}, "7202097638": {"Name": "Jackson N.J.", "AuthorID": "7202097638", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Manchester"}, "7202568432": {"Name": "Kay S.T.", "AuthorID": "7202568432", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Manchester"}, "57200213088": {"Name": "Peters A.", "AuthorID": "57200213088", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Manchester"}, "7403653187": {"Name": "Watson R.A.", "AuthorID": "7403653187", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Manchester"}, "15841786900": {"Name": "Abdalla F.B.", "AuthorID": "15841786900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "25651345000": {"Name": "Casey C.M.", "AuthorID": "25651345000", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy, University of Texas at Austin"}, "57195060999": {"Name": "Manning S.M.", "AuthorID": "57195060999", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy, University of Texas at Austin"}, "55976935700": {"Name": "Hales C.A.", "AuthorID": "55976935700", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics, Statistics and Physics, Newcastle University"}, "56512198400": {"Name": "Riseley C.J.", "AuthorID": "56512198400", "AffiliationID": "124821497", "AffiliationName": "CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
