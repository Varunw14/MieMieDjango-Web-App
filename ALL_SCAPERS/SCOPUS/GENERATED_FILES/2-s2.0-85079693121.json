In this paper we show how to capture some of this cosmic web information by using the minimum spanning tree (MST), for the first time using it to estimate cosmological parameters in simulations. Discrete tracers of dark matter such as galaxies, N-body particles or haloes are used as nodes to construct a unique graph, the MST, that traces skeletal structure. We study the dependence of the MST on cosmological parameters using haloes from a suite of COmoving Lagrangian Acceleration (COLA) simulations with a box size of 250 h-1 Mpc, varying the amplitude of scalar fluctuations (As), matter density (\u03a92m), and neutrino mass (\u03a3m\u03bd). The power spectrum P and bispectrum B are measured for wavenumbers between 0.125 and 0.5 hMpc-1, while a corresponding lower cut of \u223c12.6 h-1 Mpc is applied to the MST The constraints from the individual methods are fairly similar but when combined we see improved 1er constraints of \u223c 17 per cent (\u223c 12 per cent) on \u03a9mand \u223c 12 per cent (\u223c 10 per cent) on As with respect to P (P + B) thus showing the MST is providing additional information. The MST can be applied to current and future spectroscopic surveys (BOSS, DESI, Euclid, PSF, WFIRST, and 4MOST) in 3D and photometric surveys (DES and LSST) in tomographic shells to constrain parameters and/or test systematics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cosmological parameters", "Large-scale structure of Universe", "Methods: data analysis", "Neutrinos"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079693121", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57189089616": {"Name": "Naidoo K.", "AuthorID": "57189089616", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57190764400": {"Name": "Whiteway L.", "AuthorID": "57190764400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7005760971": {"Name": "Lahav O.", "AuthorID": "7005760971", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "27267690300": {"Name": "Font-Ribera A.", "AuthorID": "27267690300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56845489100": {"Name": "Massara E.", "AuthorID": "56845489100", "AffiliationID": "60105360", "AffiliationName": "Center for Computational Astrophysics, Flatiron Institute"}, "57203098750": {"Name": "Gualdi D.", "AuthorID": "57203098750", "AffiliationID": "60001576, 60013955, 60022558", "AffiliationName": "ICC, University of Barcelona, IEEC-UB"}, "36465203500": {"Name": "Gil-Mar\u00edn H.", "AuthorID": "36465203500", "AffiliationID": "60022558", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Space Studies of Catalonia (IEEC)"}, "7003963996": {"Name": "viel M.", "AuthorID": "7003963996", "AffiliationID": "123178262", "AffiliationName": "IFPU - Institute for Fundamental Physics of the Universe"}}}
