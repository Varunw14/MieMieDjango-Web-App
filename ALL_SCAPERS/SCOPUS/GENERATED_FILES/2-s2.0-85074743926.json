Titanium dioxide TiO2 is an appealing candidate as a cathode material due to high natural reserves of the constituent elements as well as its nontoxicity and high chemical robustness. In this work, we assessed the potential of anatase TiO2 nanorods as a cathode material for Al-ion storage. This material delivers high capacities of 112-165 mAh g-1 at a current density of 50 mA g-1 in AlCl3/1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ionic liquid electrolyte of various acidity. The mechanism of aluminum intercalation into anatase TiO2 nanorods and the related crystal structure changes were assessed by density functional theory, ex situ X-ray photoelectron and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Al-ion battery", "aluminum", "energy storage", "nanorod", "synthesis", "titanium(IV) oxide"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cath-ode materials", "Chemical robustness", "Constituent elements", "Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy", "Ion batteries", "Ionic liquid electrolytes", "Natural reserves", "Stationary energy storages"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074743926", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57191711760": {"Name": "Wang S.", "AuthorID": "57191711760", "AffiliationID": "60020086", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Thin Films and Photovoltaics, Empa - Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology"}, "22941169400": {"Name": "Kravchyk K.V.", "AuthorID": "22941169400", "AffiliationID": "60020086", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Thin Films and Photovoltaics, Empa - Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology"}, "7003748272": {"Name": "Krumeich F.", "AuthorID": "7003748272", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Inorganic Chemistry, Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences, ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "7003975949": {"Name": "W\u00f6rle M.", "AuthorID": "7003975949", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Inorganic Chemistry, Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences, ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "12797537000": {"Name": "Kovalenko M.V.", "AuthorID": "12797537000", "AffiliationID": "60020086", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Thin Films and Photovoltaics, Empa - Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology"}, "16315187800": {"Name": "Bodnarchuk M.I.", "AuthorID": "16315187800", "AffiliationID": "60020086", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Thin Films and Photovoltaics, Empa - Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology"}, "25621542000": {"Name": "Pigeot-R\u00e9my S.", "AuthorID": "25621542000", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60010578, 60008134, 60158061, 60108665", "AffiliationName": "Sorbonne University, CNRS, College of France, PSL Research University, Laboratory Chemistry of the Condensed Matter of Paris, LCMCP"}, "6602656321": {"Name": "Cassaignon S.", "AuthorID": "6602656321", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60010578, 60008134, 60158061, 60108665", "AffiliationName": "Sorbonne University, CNRS, College of France, PSL Research University, Laboratory Chemistry of the Condensed Matter of Paris, LCMCP"}, "6506879759": {"Name": "Durupthy O.", "AuthorID": "6506879759", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60010578, 60008134, 60158061, 60108665", "AffiliationName": "Sorbonne University, CNRS, College of France, PSL Research University, Laboratory Chemistry of the Condensed Matter of Paris, LCMCP"}, "7401448713": {"Name": "Sanchez C.", "AuthorID": "7401448713", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60010578, 60008134, 60158061, 60108665", "AffiliationName": "Sorbonne University, CNRS, College of France, PSL Research University, Laboratory Chemistry of the Condensed Matter of Paris, LCMCP"}, "57193115330": {"Name": "Tang W.", "AuthorID": "57193115330", "AffiliationID": "60011069, 60117934", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Chemical Engineering, School of Chemical Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology"}, "36969286100": {"Name": "Zhao S.", "AuthorID": "36969286100", "AffiliationID": "60011069, 60117934", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Chemical Engineering, School of Chemical Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology"}}}
