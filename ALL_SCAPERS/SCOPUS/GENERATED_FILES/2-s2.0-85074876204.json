Here, we report a high temperature single photon emitter based on a \"surface-free\" GaAs quantum dot (QD) in a GaAsP nanowire. By using self-catalyzed vapor-liquid-solid growth and simple surface engineering, we can significantly enhance the optical signal from the QDs with a highly polarized photoluminescence at 750 nm. The \"surface-free\" nanowire quantum dots show photon antibunching up to 160 K and well resolved exciton lines as high as 220 K.", "AuthorKeywords": ["nanowire", "photon antibunching", "quantum dot", "single photon source", "surface engineering"], "IndexKeywords": ["High temperature", "Photon antibunching", "Polarized photoluminescence", "Single photon emission", "Single photon emitters", "Single-photon source", "Surface engineering", "Vapor-liquid-solid growth"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074876204", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57197204655": {"Name": "Yu P.", "AuthorID": "57197204655", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Materials Engineering, Research School of Physics and Engineering, Australian National University"}, "57205528415": {"Name": "Wu T.", "AuthorID": "57205528415", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Fundamental and Frontier Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "57218145377": {"Name": "Tong X.", "AuthorID": "57218145377", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Fundamental and Frontier Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "56147656900": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "56147656900", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Fundamental and Frontier Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "10141185300": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "10141185300", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Fundamental and Frontier Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "36014192000": {"Name": "Jagadish C.", "AuthorID": "36014192000", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Materials Engineering, Research School of Physics and Engineering, Australian National University"}, "54780880800": {"Name": "Wang Z.M.", "AuthorID": "54780880800", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Fundamental and Frontier Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "55787220500": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "55787220500", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Materials Engineering, Research School of Physics and Engineering, Australian National University"}, "57201817468": {"Name": "Fu L.", "AuthorID": "57201817468", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Materials Engineering, Research School of Physics and Engineering, Australian National University"}, "7403011080": {"Name": "Tan H.H.", "AuthorID": "7403011080", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Materials Engineering, Research School of Physics and Engineering, Australian National University"}, "55822096100": {"Name": "Wang Y.T.", "AuthorID": "55822096100", "AffiliationID": "60019118, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Quantum Information, University of Science and Technology of China, CAS"}, "25937350100": {"Name": "Li C.F.", "AuthorID": "25937350100", "AffiliationID": "60019118, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Quantum Information, University of Science and Technology of China, CAS"}, "37014213000": {"Name": "Wang Z.", "AuthorID": "37014213000", "AffiliationID": "60110238", "AffiliationName": "Department of Quantum and Energy Materials, International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory (INL)"}, "7401765072": {"Name": "Wei S.H.", "AuthorID": "7401765072", "AffiliationID": "60104686", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Computational Science Research Center"}, "37017831000": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "37017831000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "15765485000": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "15765485000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
