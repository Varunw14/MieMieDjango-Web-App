All rights reserved.All life on Earth is built of organic molecules, so the primordial sources of reduced carbon remain a major open question in studies of the origin of life. A variant of the alkaline-hydrothermal-vent theory for life\u2019s emergence suggests that organics could have been produced by the reduction of CO2 via H2 oxidation, facilitated by geologically sustained pH gradients. The process would be an abiotic analog\u2014and proposed evolutionary predecessor\u2014of the Wood\u2013Ljungdahl acetyl-CoA pathway of modern archaea and bacteria. The first energetic bottleneck of the pathway involves the endergonic reduction of CO2 with H2 to formate (HCOO\u2013), which has proven elusive in mild abiotic settings. Here we show the reduction of CO2 with H2 at room temperature under moderate pressures (1.5 bar), driven by microfluidic pH gradients across inorganic Fe(Ni)S precipitates. Isotopic labeling with 13C confirmed formate production. Separately, deuterium (2H) labeling indicated that electron transfer to CO2 does not occur via direct hydrogenation with H2 but instead, freshly deposited Fe(Ni)S precipitates appear to facilitate electron transfer in an electrochemical-cell mechanism with two distinct half-reactions. Decreasing the pH gradient significantly, removing H2, or eliminating the precipitate yielded no detectable product. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of spatially separated yet electrically coupled geochemical reactions as drivers of otherwise endergonic processes. Beyond corroborating the ability of early-Earth alkaline hydrothermal systems to couple carbon reduction to hydrogen oxidation through biologically relevant mechanisms, these results may also be of significance for industrial and environmental applications, where other redox reactions could be facilitated using similarly mild approaches.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carbon fixation", "Catalysis", "Electrochemistry", "Membranes", "Origin of life"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carbon Cycle", "Carbon Dioxide", "Electron Transport", "Hydrogen", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration", "Hydrothermal Vents", "Oxidation-Reduction", "Proton-Motive Force"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091100371", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"36959360800": {"Name": "Hudson R.", "AuthorID": "36959360800", "AffiliationID": "60016648", "AffiliationName": "RIKEN Center for Sustainable Resource Science"}, "57219022911": {"Name": "de Graaf R.", "AuthorID": "57219022911", "AffiliationID": "60017466", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, College of the Atlantic"}, "57219030625": {"Name": "Rodin M.S.", "AuthorID": "57219030625", "AffiliationID": "60017466", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, College of the Atlantic"}, "55116513600": {"Name": "Ohno A.", "AuthorID": "55116513600", "AffiliationID": "60016648", "AffiliationName": "RIKEN Center for Sustainable Resource Science"}, "16245474900": {"Name": "McGlynn S.E.", "AuthorID": "16245474900", "AffiliationID": "60170182", "AffiliationName": "Blue Marble Space Institute of Science"}, "16644329500": {"Name": "Yamada Y.M.A.", "AuthorID": "16644329500", "AffiliationID": "60016648", "AffiliationName": "RIKEN Center for Sustainable Resource Science"}, "7402731994": {"Name": "Nakamura R.", "AuthorID": "7402731994", "AffiliationID": "60031126", "AffiliationName": "Earth-Life Science Institute, Tokyo Institute of Technology"}, "57091567800": {"Name": "Sojo V.", "AuthorID": "57091567800", "AffiliationID": "60011425", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Comparative Genomics, Richard Gilder Graduate School, American Museum of Natural History"}, "7101606919": {"Name": "Lane N.", "AuthorID": "7101606919", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "6507965371": {"Name": "Barge L.M.", "AuthorID": "6507965371", "AffiliationID": "60009037, 60031581, 60016296", "AffiliationName": "NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology"}, "7201926668": {"Name": "Braun D.", "AuthorID": "7201926668", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Center for Nanoscience, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"}}}
