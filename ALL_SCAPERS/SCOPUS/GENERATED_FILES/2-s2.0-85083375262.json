Motivations for taking part in the programme included a desire for: (1) exploration of autism; (2) empowerment; and (3) the development of practical strategies and coping mechanisms. Interviews were conducted upon completion of the programme and again 6 months later. Using thematic analysis, three themes were identified: (1) appreciation of the autistic-led nature of the programme; (2) unity in diversity; and (3) developing a positive, practical outlook on autism. These promising initial results highlight the value of autistic-led peer support for those recently diagnosed/identified as autistic.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adults", "Autism", "Autistic-led", "Diagnosis", "Peer support", "Post-diagnostic support"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083375262", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"23766915000": {"Name": "Crane L.", "AuthorID": "23766915000", "AffiliationID": "60010964", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Goldsmiths, University of London"}, "57201557313": {"Name": "Ashworth M.", "AuthorID": "57201557313", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Research in Autism and Education (CRAE), UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "57216392840": {"Name": "Davies J.", "AuthorID": "57216392840", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Research in Autism and Education (CRAE), UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "57216398812": {"Name": "Hearst C.", "AuthorID": "57216398812", "AffiliationID": "124262212", "AffiliationName": "AutAngel CIC and Autism Matters"}, "7202000943": {"Name": "Hill E.L.", "AuthorID": "7202000943", "AffiliationID": "60010964", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Goldsmiths, University of London"}}}
