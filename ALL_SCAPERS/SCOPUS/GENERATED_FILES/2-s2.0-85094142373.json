Our aim was to investigate the CVD events (CVDEs) and survival between the patients with FMF-related AA amyloidosis and glomerulonephropathies (GN) to define possible predictors for CVDEs. A prospective follow-up study with FMF-amyloidosis and glomerulonephropathy (GN) was performed and patients were followed for CVDEs. Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), FGF-23, serum lipid, hsCRP levels, BMI and HOMA were assessed. A Cox regression analysis was performed to evaluate the risk factors for CVDEs. There were 107 patients in the FMF-amyloidosis group and 126 patients with GN group. Forty-seven CVDEs were observed during the 4.2-years follow up; all 28 patients in the FMF-amyloidosis group and 14/19 patients with GN developed CVDEs before the age of 40 (p = 0.002). CVD mortality was 2.8 times higher (95% CI 1.02\u20137.76) in patients with FMF-amyloidosis. Across both groups, FMD and FGF23 (p < 0.001) levels were independently associated with the risk of CVDEs. Patients with FMF-amyloidosis are at increased risk of early CVDEs with premature mortality age. FGF 23, FMD and hsCRP can stratify the risk of early CVD in patients with FMF-related AA amyloidosis.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094142373", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57190093613": {"Name": "Romano M.", "AuthorID": "57190093613", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Rheumatology, ASST G Pini"}, "24177851200": {"Name": "Berard R.A.", "AuthorID": "24177851200", "AffiliationID": "60031619, 60010884", "AffiliationName": "Division of Paediatric Rheumatology, Department of Paediatrics, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, University of Western Ontario"}, "57220911635": {"Name": "Jackson B.C.", "AuthorID": "57220911635", "AffiliationID": "60031619, 60010884", "AffiliationName": "Division of Paediatric Rheumatology, Department of Paediatrics, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, University of Western Ontario"}, "6507346726": {"Name": "Demirkaya E.", "AuthorID": "6507346726", "AffiliationID": "60031619, 60010884", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, University of Western Ontario"}, "57217041113": {"Name": "Piskin D.", "AuthorID": "57217041113", "AffiliationID": "60030222, 60026135", "AffiliationName": "Lawson Health Research Institute, London Health Sciences Center"}, "55340420100": {"Name": "Acikel C.", "AuthorID": "55340420100", "AffiliationID": "120785529", "AffiliationName": "CRI - Clinical Research International Ltd."}, "16834646800": {"Name": "Carrero J.J.", "AuthorID": "16834646800", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics (MEB), Karolinska Institutet"}, "7004915734": {"Name": "Lachmann H.J.", "AuthorID": "7004915734", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine (Royal Free Campus), Centre for Amyloidosis & Acute Phase Proteins"}, "15758674100": {"Name": "Yilmaz M.I.", "AuthorID": "15758674100", "AffiliationID": "101659586", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Nephrology, Epigenetic Health Solutions"}}}
