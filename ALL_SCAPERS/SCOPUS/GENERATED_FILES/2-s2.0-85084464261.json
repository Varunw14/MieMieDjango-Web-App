However, much of the world's energy is still produced from fossil fuels and thus the progress towards clean and renewable energy is slow. This paper explores the key challenges towards renewable energy in Gulf Cooperation Council countries blessed with plenty of oil and gas reserves. The key challenges identified through literature review were ranked using a quantitative approach through the data collected from a selective sample across the six countries. These challenges in order of importance were found to be policies and regulations, manpower experience and competencies, renewable energy education, public awareness, costs and incentives for renewable energy and government commitment. The findings could be helpful to decision makers and government organisations in the region to develop strategies to overcome these identified challenges.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Exploratory studies", "Gulf Cooperation Council", "Literature reviews", "Oil and gas reserves", "Quantitative approach", "Renewable energies", "Renewable energy education", "Social and economic development"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084464261", "SubjectAreas": [["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"]], "AuthorData": {"57191539961": {"Name": "Umar T.", "AuthorID": "57191539961", "AffiliationID": "60118530", "AffiliationName": "College of Engineering, A'Sharqiyah University"}, "57194464762": {"Name": "Honnurvali M.S.", "AuthorID": "57194464762", "AffiliationID": "60118530", "AffiliationName": "College of Engineering, A'Sharqiyah University"}, "6603169525": {"Name": "Egbu C.", "AuthorID": "6603169525", "AffiliationID": "60026116", "AffiliationName": "University of East London"}, "7004658193": {"Name": "Ofori G.", "AuthorID": "7004658193", "AffiliationID": "60031237", "AffiliationName": "School of the Built Environment and Architecture, London South Bank University"}, "6701603889": {"Name": "Saidani M.", "AuthorID": "6701603889", "AffiliationID": "60017326", "AffiliationName": "School of Energy, Construction and Environment, Faculty of Engineering, Environment and Computing, Coventry University"}, "55218370900": {"Name": "Opoku A.", "AuthorID": "55218370900", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, Faculty of the Built Environment, University College London"}}}
