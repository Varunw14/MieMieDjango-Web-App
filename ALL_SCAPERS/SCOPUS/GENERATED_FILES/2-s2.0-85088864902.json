Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) comprise a family of RNA-binding proteins with diverse, multi-functional roles across all aspects of mRNA processing. The role of these proteins in neurodegeneration is far from understood. Here, we review some of the unifying mechanisms by which hnRNPs have been directly or indirectly linked with FTD/ALS pathogenesis, including their incorporation into pathological inclusions and their best-known roles in pre-mRNA splicing regulation. We also discuss the broader functionalities of hnRNPs including their roles in cryptic exon repression, stress granule assembly and in co-ordinating the DNA damage response, which are all emerging pathogenic themes in both diseases. We then present an integrated model that depicts how a broad-ranging network of pathogenic events can arise from declining levels of functional hnRNPs that are inadequately compensated for by autoregulatory means. Finally, we provide a comprehensive overview of the most functionally relevant cellular roles, in the context of FTD/ALS pathogenesis, for hnRNPs A1-U.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis", "Autoregulation", "Frontotemporal dementia", "hnRNP", "RNA"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088864902", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"57209221273": {"Name": "Bampton A.", "AuthorID": "57209221273", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Diseases, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "6602721075": {"Name": "Lashley T.", "AuthorID": "6602721075", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Diseases, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "57220384020": {"Name": "Gatt A.", "AuthorID": "57220384020", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Diseases, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "57198769847": {"Name": "Gittings L.M.", "AuthorID": "57198769847", "AffiliationID": "60001362", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, Barrow Neurological Institute"}, "12802595400": {"Name": "Fratta P.", "AuthorID": "12802595400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}}}
