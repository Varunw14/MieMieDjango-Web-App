In the shadow of the official heritage of the mill, this was a DoIt-Yourself event, organised by us, neither of whom would consider ourselves to be heritage experts. We started out, for different reasons, simply hoping to enjoy an open-air screening of our own making. Of the authors, BL grew up during the 1970s with drive-in theatres in the USA; he lectures on youth arts and urban leisure. SB was planning on showing films in his garden and, as an architect, his practice centres on urban design; he is based in offices at Marshall\u2019s Mill. After wet weather postponed our small-scale back-garden attempts we sketched out some grander ideas. How could we develop a cinema event that made public use of and celebrated Marshall Mill\u2019s heritage and landscape? As our plans for the site-specific cinema grew we had a series of fortunate windfalls, including a partnership with the UK Green Film Festival. After nine months of planning in May 2012 we hosted a screening of the film Happy (2011 Dir. Roko Belic) in the Marshall\u2019s Mill car park. In sum, the event became something far more interesting than we had initially envisioned. Schofield and Szymanski (2011: 7) suggested that heritage might come alive when \u2018artistic practice connects people to place in imaginative and often unforeseen ways\u2019. This chapter celebrates the sometimes surprising possibilities for counter-mapping cultural heritage involving cinema under the stars and heritage from below.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087268608", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"], ["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"]], "AuthorData": {"12802581300": {"Name": "Lashua B.", "AuthorID": "12802581300", "AffiliationID": "60032773", "AffiliationName": "Carnegie Faculty, Leeds Metropolitan University"}, "56174051500": {"Name": "Baker S.", "AuthorID": "56174051500", "AffiliationID": "114411073", "AffiliationName": "Architecture Centre for Leeds City Region"}}}
