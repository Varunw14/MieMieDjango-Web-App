Design/methodology/approach: Principles of post-disaster settlement and shelter are examined for the Arctic and then for the case study of Svalbard, Norway. Findings: Established principles apply in the Arctic, but are not easy to implement. Limited practical experience exists, and some Arctic humanitarian situations require much more investigation to understand how to deal with the post-disaster settlement and shelter process.
