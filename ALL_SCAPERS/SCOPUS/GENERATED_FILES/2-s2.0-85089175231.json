Methods: This is a retrospective study of patients with neovascular AMD resistant to ranibizumab defined as having persistent intra- or subretinal fluid on OCT scans despite at least 6-month treatment and switched to aflibercept. Clinical data was collected and quantitative measurements of the area of EZ and ELM damage were obtained, on en-face optical coherence tomography images, at the time of switch to aflibercept (baseline) and up to 6 months of follow-up. Results: The study included 71 eyes (52.1% right eye) of 71 patients. At baseline, there was a correlation between the size of the EZ and ELM damaged area and BCVA (R = \u22120.39, p = 0.001 and R = \u22120.47, p < 0.001, respectively). The EZ and ELM damaged areas maintained correlation with BCVA at 6 months (R = \u22120.28, p = 0.01 and R = \u22120.39, p = 0.001, respectively). Central retinal thickness did not correlate with BCVA at the time of switch (p = 0.38) or at 6 months (p = 0.36). Conclusions: The extent of damage to the EZ and ELM correlates with BCVA following a switch in treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aflibercept", "Age-related macular degeneration", "Best corrected visual acuity", "Ellipsoid zone", "External limiting membrane"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089175231", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"57195993627": {"Name": "Woronkowicz M.", "AuthorID": "57195993627", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "15035438500": {"Name": "Lightman S.", "AuthorID": "15035438500", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57201661157": {"Name": "Tomkins-Netzer O.", "AuthorID": "57201661157", "AffiliationID": "112955162", "AffiliationName": "Ophthalmology Department, Lady Davis Carmel Medical Centre"}}}
