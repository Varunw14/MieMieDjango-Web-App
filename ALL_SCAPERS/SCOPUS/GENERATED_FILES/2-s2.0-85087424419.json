In this study, Weigelt et al. identify a circular RNA that is specifically regulated in long-lived insulin mutant flies and extends the lifespan of fruit flies.\u00a9 2020 The AuthorsCircular RNAs (circRNAs) are abundant and accumulate with age in neurons of diverse species. However, only few circRNAs have been functionally characterized, and their role during aging has not been addressed. Here, we use transcriptome profiling during aging and find that accumulation of circRNAs is slowed down in long-lived insulin mutant flies. Next, we characterize the in vivo function of a circRNA generated by the sulfateless gene (circSfl), which is consistently upregulated, particularly in the brain and muscle, of diverse long-lived insulin mutants. Strikingly, lifespan extension of insulin mutants is dependent on circSfl, and overexpression of circSfl alone is sufficient to extend the lifespan. Moreover, circSfl is translated into a protein that shares the N terminus and potentially some functions with the full-length Sfl protein encoded by the host gene. Our study demonstrates that insulin signaling affects global circRNA accumulation and reveals an important role of circSfl during aging in vivo.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ageing", "alternative splicing", "backsplicing", "circRNA", "Drosophila", "heparan sulfate", "insulin", "longevity", "non-coding RNAs", "sulfateless"], "IndexKeywords": ["Diverse species", "Fruit flies", "Insulin signaling", "Lifespan extensions", "N terminus", "Non-coding RNAs", "Over-expression", "Transcriptome profiling", "Aging", "Animals", "Animals, Genetically Modified", "Drosophila", "Drosophila Proteins", "Female", "Insulin", "Longevity", "Male", "Mutation", "Neurons", "RNA, Circular", "Sulfotransferases", "Transcriptome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087424419", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"57195514168": {"Name": "Weigelt C.M.", "AuthorID": "57195514168", "AffiliationID": "60103814", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing, Joseph-Stelzmann-Str. 9b"}, "57217854565": {"Name": "Sehgal R.", "AuthorID": "57217854565", "AffiliationID": "60103814", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing, Joseph-Stelzmann-Str. 9b"}, "24173766800": {"Name": "Tain L.S.", "AuthorID": "24173766800", "AffiliationID": "60103814", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing, Joseph-Stelzmann-Str. 9b"}, "57188974778": {"Name": "Cheng J.", "AuthorID": "57188974778", "AffiliationID": "60103814", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing, Joseph-Stelzmann-Str. 9b"}, "57200391661": {"Name": "E\u00dfer J.", "AuthorID": "57200391661", "AffiliationID": "60103814", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing, Joseph-Stelzmann-Str. 9b"}, "57217849478": {"Name": "Pahl A.", "AuthorID": "57217849478", "AffiliationID": "60103814", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing, Joseph-Stelzmann-Str. 9b"}, "7004115873": {"Name": "Dieterich C.", "AuthorID": "7004115873", "AffiliationID": "60003280", "AffiliationName": "Section of Bioinformatics and Systems Cardiology, University Hospital Heidelberg"}, "6507547538": {"Name": "Gr\u00f6nke S.", "AuthorID": "6507547538", "AffiliationID": "60103814", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing, Joseph-Stelzmann-Str. 9b"}, "57202667589": {"Name": "Partridge L.", "AuthorID": "57202667589", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Healthy Ageing, Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London, Darwin Building"}}}
