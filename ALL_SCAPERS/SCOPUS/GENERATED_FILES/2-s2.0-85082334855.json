However, they always suffer from a low-quality (Q) factor owing to the intrinsic loss of metal. Here, we numerically propose a plasmonic resonator with ultra-high Q factor based on plasmonic metal\u2013insulator-metal (MIM) waveguide structures. The resonator consists of a disk cavity surrounded by a concentric ring cavity, possessing an ultra-small volume. Arising from the plasmon hybridization between plasmon modes in the disk and ring cavity, the induced bonding hybridized modes have an ultra-narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) as well as ultra-high Q factors. The FWHM can be nearly 1 nm and Q factor can be more than 400. Furthermore, such a device can act as a refractive index sensor with an ultra-high figure of merit (FOM). This work provides a novel approach to design plasmonic high-Q-factor resonators and has potential on-chip applications such as filters, multi-spectral sensors and nanolasers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Metal\u2013insulator-metal waveguide", "plasmonic resonator", "plasmonic sensor", "plasmonic waveguide"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082334855", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57197772732": {"Name": "Zhang Z.", "AuthorID": "57197772732", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, National University of Defense Technology"}, "56732089500": {"Name": "Huang J.", "AuthorID": "56732089500", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57013633200": {"Name": "Chen D.", "AuthorID": "57013633200", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, National University of Defense Technology"}, "16023467700": {"Name": "Yang J.", "AuthorID": "16023467700", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "Center of Material Science, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57192831289": {"Name": "Han Y.", "AuthorID": "57192831289", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "Center of Material Science, National University of Defense Technology"}, "55491491300": {"Name": "He X.", "AuthorID": "55491491300", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "Center of Material Science, National University of Defense Technology"}}}
