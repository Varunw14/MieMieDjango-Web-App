Data (N=5342, 26% female) were drawn from the Whitehall II cohort study. Participants completed repeated assessments of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1, L) and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV, m/s) over 5 years. The effect of FEV1 on later cf-PWV and its progression was estimated using linear mixed-effects modeling. Possible explanatory mechanisms, such as mediation by low-grade systemic inflammation, common-cause explanation by preexisting cardiometabolic risk factors, and reverse-causation bias, were assessed. Poorer pulmonary function was associated with later higher cf-PWV and its subsequent progression (cf-PWV 5-year change 0.09, 95% CI 0.03-0.17 per SD lower FEV1) after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, heart rate, and mean arterial pressure. Decrease in pulmonary function was associated with later higher cf-PWV (0.17, 95% CI 0.04-0.30 in the top compared to bottom quartile of decline in FEV1). There was no evidence to support mediation by circulating CRP (C-reactive protein) or IL (interleukin)-6. Furthermore, arterial stiffness was not associated with later FEV1 after accounting for cardiometabolic status. In conclusion, poorer pulmonary function predicted future arterial stiffness. These findings support pulmonary function as a clinically important risk factor for arterial stiffness and provide justification for future intervention studies for pulmonary function based on its relationship with arterial stiffness.", "AuthorKeywords": ["epidemiology", "inflammation", "longitudinal study", "respiratory function", "respiratory function"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Blood Pressure", "Carotid Arteries", "Female", "Femoral Artery", "Forced Expiratory Volume", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pulse Wave Analysis", "Respiration", "Respiratory Function Tests", "Vascular Stiffness"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072133579", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"]], "AuthorData": {"57189066532": {"Name": "Okamoto M.", "AuthorID": "57189066532", "AffiliationID": "60178602", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo"}, "7103265845": {"Name": "Shipley M.J.", "AuthorID": "7103265845", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "57202432414": {"Name": "Valencia-Hern\u00e1ndez C.A.", "AuthorID": "57202432414", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "9734197200": {"Name": "Singh-Manoux A.", "AuthorID": "9734197200", "AffiliationID": "60112042, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Inserm U1153, Epidemiology of Ageing and Neurodegenerative Diseases"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivimaki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "24576354300": {"Name": "Brunner E.J.", "AuthorID": "24576354300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "57214381044": {"Name": "Wilkinson I.B.", "AuthorID": "57214381044", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Division of Experimental Medicine and Immunotherapeutics, University of Cambridge"}, "6602002236": {"Name": "McEniery C.M.", "AuthorID": "6602002236", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Division of Experimental Medicine and Immunotherapeutics, University of Cambridge"}}}
