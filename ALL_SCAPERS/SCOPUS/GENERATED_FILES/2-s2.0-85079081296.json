Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The monitoring and prediction of the landslide groundwater level is a crucial part of landslide early warning systems. In this study, Tangjiao landslide in the Three Gorges Reservoir area (TGRA) in China was taken as a case study. Three groundwater level monitoring sensors were installed in different locations of the landslide. The monitoring data indicated that the fluctuation of groundwater level is significantly consistent with rainfall and reservoir level in time, but there is a lag. In addition, there is a spatial difference in the impact of reservoir levels on the landslide groundwater level. The data of two monitoring locations were selected for establishing the prediction model of groundwater. Combined with the qualitative and quantitative analysis, the influencing factors were selected, respectively, to establish the hybrid Genetic Algorithm-Support Vector Machine (GA-SVM) prediction model. The single-factor GA-SVM without considering influencing factors and the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) model were adopted to make comparisons. The results showed that the multi-factor GA-SVM performed the best, followed by multi-factor BPNN and single-factor GA-SVM. We found that the prediction accuracy can be improved by considering the influencing factor. The proposed GA-SVM model combines the advantages of each algorithm; it can effectively construct the response relationship between groundwater level fluctuations and influencing factors. Above all, the multi-factor GA-SVM is an effective method for the prediction of landslides groundwater in the TGRA.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Groundwater level prediction", "Influencing factors", "Landslides monitoring", "Support Vector Machine", "Three Gorges Reservoir area"], "IndexKeywords": ["Back-propagation neural networks", "Groundwater level fluctuation", "Hybrid genetic algorithms", "Influencing factors", "Landslides monitoring", "Qualitative and quantitative analysis", "Three gorges reservoir area", "Three Gorges Reservoir Area(TGRA)"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079081296", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55976717100": {"Name": "Cao Y.", "AuthorID": "55976717100", "AffiliationID": "60006019", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering, China University of Geosciences"}, "8905848100": {"Name": "Yin K.", "AuthorID": "8905848100", "AffiliationID": "60006019", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering, China University of Geosciences"}, "55976019600": {"Name": "Zhou C.", "AuthorID": "55976019600", "AffiliationID": "60006019", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography and Information Engineering, China University of Geosciences"}, "55919919600": {"Name": "Ahmed B.", "AuthorID": "55919919600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, University College London (UCL)"}}}
