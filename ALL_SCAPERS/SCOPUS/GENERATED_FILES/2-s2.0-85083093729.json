For a data set of 898 varied organic, organometallic and inorganic compounds the regression standard deviation is 9.9 kJ mol \u22121, somewhat better than previous analyses of general data sets, 11.4 and 14.7 kJ mol \u22121. We have also constructed equations on the same lines, using the data set of Gharagheizi on enthalpies of sublimation at the triple point temperature. The set of 963 compounds yielded an equation with a regression standard deviation of 6.6 kJ mol \u22121, about the same as previous analyses, 4.2\u20137.9 kJ mol \u22121. Predictions of further enthalpies of sublimation through our equations can be made using simple arithmetic \u2013 no computer programs are needed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Abraham descriptors", "Enthalpies of sublimation", "Multiple linear regression"], "IndexKeywords": ["Data set", "Descriptors", "Multiple linear regression equations", "Standard deviation", "Triple point temperatures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083093729", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"7202901240": {"Name": "Abraham M.H.", "AuthorID": "7202901240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "35496753700": {"Name": "Acree W.E.", "AuthorID": "35496753700", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}}}
