Indeed, the physiological process of ageing causes a variety of molecular and cellular phenotypes. With dysfunction at the neuromuscular junction implicated as a key pathological mechanism in ALS, and each lower motor unit cell type vulnerable to its own set of age-related phenotypes, the effects of ageing might in fact prove a prerequisite to ALS, rendering the cells susceptible to disease-specific mechanisms. Moreover, we discuss evidence for overlap between age and ALS-associated hallmarks, potentially implicating cell type-specific ageing as a key contributor to this multifactorial and complex disease. With a dearth of disease-modifying therapy currently available for ALS patients and a substantial failure in bench to bedside translation of other potential therapies, the unification of research in ageing and ALS requires high fidelity models to better recapitulate age-related human disease and will ultimately yield more reliable candidate therapeutics for patients, with the aim of enhancing healthspan and life expectancy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ageing", "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis", "Healthspan", "Lower motor unit", "Neuromuscular junction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aging", "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "Animals", "Cellular Senescence", "Humans", "Motor Neurons"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086154160", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57218405496": {"Name": "Pandya V.A.", "AuthorID": "57218405496", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Francis Crick Institute"}, "16302224400": {"Name": "Patani R.", "AuthorID": "16302224400", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Francis Crick Institute"}}}
