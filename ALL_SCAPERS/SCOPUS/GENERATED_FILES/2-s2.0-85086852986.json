In this work, a free-breathing 3D whole-heart cine imaging framework was developed using a time-efficient stack of spirals trajectory and accelerated reconstruction. Two suitable view ordering methods are considered with different spacing between k-space readouts in the partition dimension: uniform and tiny golden ratio based. A simulation study suggested the latter did not present any benefits in terms of similarity to the true image. The proposed method was subsequently tested on 10 prospective subjects and compared with conventional multi-slice breath-hold imaging. Image quality was evaluated using objective and subjective scores and ventricular measurements were compared to assess clinical accuracy. Image quality was lower in the proposed technique than in breath-hold images but good agreement was found in clinically relevant ventricular measurements. In addition, the proposed method was fast to acquire, required minimal planning and provided full anatomical coverage with isotropic resolution.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cine imaging", "CMR", "Compressed sensing", "Stack of spirals"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086852986", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57204789341": {"Name": "Montalt-Tordera J.", "AuthorID": "57204789341", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science, UCL"}, "6602362169": {"Name": "Kowalik G.", "AuthorID": "6602362169", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science, UCL"}, "36605240600": {"Name": "Steeden J.", "AuthorID": "36605240600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science, UCL"}, "7801671480": {"Name": "Muthurangu V.", "AuthorID": "7801671480", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science, UCL"}, "55998577200": {"Name": "Gotschy A.", "AuthorID": "55998577200", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Biomedical Engineering, University and ETH Zurich"}}}
