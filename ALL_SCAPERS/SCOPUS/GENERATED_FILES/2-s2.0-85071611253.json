We identified homozygous POLG c.1879C>T; p.R627W mutations in two siblings from a consanguineous South Asian family following targeted resequencing of 75 nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes. Both patients presented with encephalopathy, seizures and stroke-like episodes, and mitochondrial DNA depletion was confirmed in the proband's muscle tissue. Subsequent Sanger sequencing of POLG in a further 275 unrelated probands with genetically unconfirmed mitochondrial disease revealed a third unrelated proband with a similar phenotype harboring homozygous c.1879C>T; p.R627W mutations and a fourth patient, with a milder clinical disorder, harboring compound heterozygous POLG c.1879C>T; p.R627W and c.2341G>A; p.A781T mutations. Given endogamous practices in the Indian subcontinent, homozygous POLG c.1879C>T; p.R627W mutations should be excluded in South Asian patients presenting with encephalopathy, seizures and stroke-like episodes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Encephalopathy", "Mitochondrial disease", "mtDNA", "POLG", "Seizures", "Status epilepticus", "Stroke-like episode"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Child", "DNA Polymerase gamma", "DNA, Mitochondrial", "Female", "Heterozygote", "Homozygote", "Humans", "Male", "Mitochondria", "Mutation", "Phenotype", "Seizures", "Stroke", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071611253", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"55242251800": {"Name": "Paramasivam A.", "AuthorID": "55242251800", "AffiliationID": "60109334, 60109606", "AffiliationName": "BRULAC-DRC, Saveetha Dental College & Hospital, Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences [SIMATS], Saveetha University"}, "57210827589": {"Name": "Venkatapathi C.", "AuthorID": "57210827589", "AffiliationID": "60026730", "AffiliationName": "CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"}, "56849949200": {"Name": "Mohapatra S.", "AuthorID": "56849949200", "AffiliationID": "60026730", "AffiliationName": "CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"}, "6603011487": {"Name": "Thangaraj K.", "AuthorID": "6603011487", "AffiliationID": "60026730", "AffiliationName": "CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"}, "57119753500": {"Name": "Sandeep G.", "AuthorID": "57119753500", "AffiliationID": "123102297", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Bhimavaram Hospitals"}, "55398678100": {"Name": "Meena A.K.", "AuthorID": "55398678100", "AffiliationID": "60005512", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences"}, "20435180500": {"Name": "Uppin M.S.", "AuthorID": "20435180500", "AffiliationID": "60005512", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences"}, "24475469100": {"Name": "Pitceathly R.D.S.", "AuthorID": "24475469100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuromuscular Diseases, University College London Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}}}
