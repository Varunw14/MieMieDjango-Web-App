However, current theoretical predictions of assembly are not ideally suited for direct comparison with such observational data. We therefore extend the work of prior examinations of the contribution of ex situ stars to the stellar mass budget of simulated galaxies. Our predictions are specifically tailored for direct testing with a new generation of observational techniques by calculating ex situ fractions as functions of galaxy mass and morphological type, for a range of surface brightnesses. These enable comparison with results from large field of view (FoV) Integral Field Unit (IFU) spectrographs, and increasingly accurate spectral fitting, providing a look-up method for the estimated accreted fraction. We furthermore provide predictions of ex situ mass fractions as functions of galaxy mass, galactocentric radius, and environment. Using z = 0 snapshots from the 100 and 25 cMpc3 EAGLE (Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments) simulations, we corroborate the findings of prior studies, finding that ex situ fraction increases with stellar mass for central and satellite galaxies in a stellar mass range of 2 \u00d7 107 to 1.9 \u00d7 1012 M\u2299. For those galaxies of mass M\u2217 > 5 \u00d7 108 M\u2299, we find that the total ex situ mass fraction is greater for more extended galaxies at fixed mass. When categorizing satellite galaxies by their parent group/cluster halo mass, we find that the ex situ fraction decreases with increasing parent halo mass at fixed galaxy mass. This apparently counterintuitive result may be due to high passing velocities within large cluster haloes inhibiting efficient accretion on to individual galaxies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["galaxies: evolution", "galaxies: interactions", "galaxies: structure"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85097064242", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57219694769": {"Name": "Davison T.A.", "AuthorID": "57219694769", "AffiliationID": "60010968", "AffiliationName": "Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes"}, "12787365100": {"Name": "Norris M.A.", "AuthorID": "12787365100", "AffiliationID": "60031259", "AffiliationName": "Jeremiah Horrocks Institute, University of Central Lancashire"}, "57201241802": {"Name": "Davies J.J.", "AuthorID": "57201241802", "AffiliationID": "60031259", "AffiliationName": "Jeremiah Horrocks Institute, University of Central Lancashire"}, "56081107600": {"Name": "Pfeffer J.L.", "AuthorID": "56081107600", "AffiliationID": "60028355", "AffiliationName": "Astrophysics Research Institute, Liverpool John Moores University"}, "16300736600": {"Name": "Crain R.A.", "AuthorID": "16300736600", "AffiliationID": "60028355", "AffiliationName": "Astrophysics Research Institute, Liverpool John Moores University"}}}
