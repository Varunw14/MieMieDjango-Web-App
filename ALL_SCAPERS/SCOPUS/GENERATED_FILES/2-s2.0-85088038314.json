Currently few children obtain effective mental health treatments in the context of long term physical health conditions, and ways to improve access to evidence-based mental health interventions are urgently needed. One approach is to deploy briefer, more economical, yet still evidence-based, treatments. The objective of this review was to evaluate the efficacy of brief interventions targeting psychiatric disorders in children and young people with long term physical health conditions. Methods: Predefined terms relating to brief psychological interventions for psychiatric disorders in children with long term physical health conditions were used to search relevant databases. A systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out in accordance with the Cochrane guidelines. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, extracted the data and conducted risk of bias assessments. Results: A total of 12 randomised controlled trials were found to meet the inclusion criteria of the review. Of those, three studies were suitable for meta-analysis. A large effect size in favour of brief cognitive behavioural therapy for anxiety was found (g = \u2212 0.95, CI -1.49 to \u22120.041; p < .001) with non-significant moderate-substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 58%; p = .09). Conclusion: This review suggests there is preliminary evidence that brief interventions, based on cognitive behavioural principles, may benefit young people with an anxiety disorder in the context of a long term physical health condition. There was insufficient evidence to assess whether this held true for depression and disruptive behaviour.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brief", "Child and adolescent", "Chronic illness", "Long term condition", "Mental health", "Psychological intervention"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088038314", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57218135547": {"Name": "Catanzano M.", "AuthorID": "57218135547", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "36968589700": {"Name": "Bennett S.D.", "AuthorID": "36968589700", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57220822075": {"Name": "Patel M.", "AuthorID": "57220822075", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57200531764": {"Name": "Kerry E.", "AuthorID": "57200531764", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "25958950300": {"Name": "Coughtrey A.E.", "AuthorID": "25958950300", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7402854139": {"Name": "Liang H.", "AuthorID": "7402854139", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7003916653": {"Name": "Heyman I.", "AuthorID": "7003916653", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7003543961": {"Name": "Shafran R.", "AuthorID": "7003543961", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57205314545": {"Name": "Sanderson C.", "AuthorID": "57205314545", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "55623201600": {"Name": "Manzotti G.", "AuthorID": "55623201600", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}}}
