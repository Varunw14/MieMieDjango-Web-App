Their framework includes abstract GSOS, a categorical generalisation of the classical GSOS rule format, as well as its categorical dual, coGSOS. Both formats are well behaved, in the sense that each specification has a unique model on which behavioural equivalence is a congruence. Unfortunately, the combination of the two formats does not feature these desirable properties. We show that monotone specifications\u2014that disallow negative premises\u2014do induce a canonical distributive law of a monad over a comonad, and therefore a unique, compositional interpretation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Coalgebras", "Comonads", "Distributive laws", "Generalisation", "Rule formats", "Structural operational semantics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073574533", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"55305790900": {"Name": "Rot J.", "AuthorID": "55305790900", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Radboud University"}}}
