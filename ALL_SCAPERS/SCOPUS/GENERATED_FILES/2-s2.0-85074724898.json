This chapter describes a method of isolating and culturing podocyte cells from mouse adult kidneys. In this way, podocytes with genetic modifications can be obtained from transgenic animals and they can be used to study the effects of the diabetic environment in vitro.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diabetes", "Diabetic nephropathy", "Glomerulus", "Kidney", "Podocyte"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cells, Cultured", "Diabetic Nephropathies", "Disease Models, Animal", "Humans", "Immunomagnetic Separation", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Podocytes", "Primary Cell Culture", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074724898", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"25925539800": {"Name": "Vasilopoulou E.", "AuthorID": "25925539800", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer, UCL GOS Institute of Child Health"}}}
