Liver International published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Background & Aims: Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is characterized by acute decompensation of cirrhosis (AD), organ failure(s) and high risk of short-term mortality with bacterial infection frequently as precipitating event. Innate immune pattern recognition receptors and members of the lectin pathway of complement activation are crucial to the innate immune response to pathogens. The aim of this study was to investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of innate immune components are associated with the occurrence of bacterial infections or mortality in patients with cirrhosis hospitalized for AD or ACLF. Methods: Twenty-one innate immunity SNPs with known functional implications were genotyped in 826 AD/ACLF patients included in the CANONIC study. Associations between baseline characteristics of the patients, the occurrence of bacterial infections and survival rate at 90 days of follow-up in relation to the innate immunity genetic variants were analysed. Results: The NOD2-G908R genetic variant was associated with mortality (HR 2.25, P =.004) independently of age and MELD Score. This association was also found in a predefined subgroup analysis in patients with bacterial infections (HR 2.78, P <.001) along with MBL_Yx (HR 1.72, P =.008) and MASP2_371 (HR 1.67, P =.012) genetic variants. None of the analysed SNPs were significantly associated with the occurrence of acute bacterial infections or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in particular. Conclusions: Innate immune system-specific NOD2-G908R, MBL_Yx and MASP2_371 genetic variants were independently associated with increased risk of short-term mortality in AD/ACLF patients with bacterial infection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["acute-on-chronic liver failure", "bacterial infection", "end-stage liver disease", "innate immunity", "single nucleotide polymorphism"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079712650", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"]], "AuthorData": {"57191523371": {"Name": "Schaapman J.J.", "AuthorID": "57191523371", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Leiden University Medical Center"}, "14523511200": {"Name": "van der Reijden J.J.", "AuthorID": "14523511200", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Leiden University Medical Center"}, "7005772169": {"Name": "Verspaget H.W.", "AuthorID": "7005772169", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Leiden University Medical Center"}, "6506927292": {"Name": "Coenraad M.J.", "AuthorID": "6506927292", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Leiden University Medical Center"}, "56434573400": {"Name": "Amoros \u00c0.", "AuthorID": "56434573400", "AffiliationID": "117529400", "AffiliationName": "European Foundation for the study of Chronic Liver Failure"}, "57189926149": {"Name": "Arroyo V.", "AuthorID": "57189926149", "AffiliationID": "117529400", "AffiliationName": "European Foundation for the study of Chronic Liver Failure"}, "36770842900": {"Name": "Cl\u00e0ria J.", "AuthorID": "36770842900", "AffiliationID": "60078879, 60030315, 60010814", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Cl\u00ednic, IDIBAPS and CIBERehd"}, "12780406300": {"Name": "Laleman W.", "AuthorID": "12780406300", "AffiliationID": "60031069", "AffiliationName": "UZ Leuven"}, "7103125178": {"Name": "Zeuzem S.", "AuthorID": "7103125178", "AffiliationID": "60009308", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Frankfurt"}, "7005488420": {"Name": "Ba\u00f1ares R.", "AuthorID": "7005488420", "AffiliationID": "60033237", "AffiliationName": "Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n Hospital"}, "57211739627": {"Name": "Jalan R.", "AuthorID": "57211739627", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
