A paradigmatic model-free (MF) strategy simply repeats actions that have been rewarded in the past; by contrast, model-sensitive (MS) strategies exploit richer information associated with knowledge of task dynamics. MF and MS strategies should typically be combined, because they have complementary statistical and computational strengths; however, this tradeoff between MF/MS RL has mostly only been demonstrated in humans, often with only modest numbers of trials. We trained rhesus monkeys to perform a two-stage decision task designed to elicit and discriminate the use of MF and MS methods. A descriptive analysis of choice behaviour revealed directly that the structure of the task (of MS importance) and the reward history (of MF and MS importance) significantly influenced both choice and response vigour. A detailed, trial-by-trial computational analysis confirmed that choices were made according to a combination of strategies, with a dominant influence of a particular form of model sensitivity that persisted over weeks of testing. The residuals from this model necessitated development of a new combined RL model which incorporates a particular credit assignment weighting procedure. Finally, response vigor exhibited a subtly different collection of MF and MS influences. These results provide new illumination onto RL behavioural processes in non-human primates. by multiple systems in the brain which use different solutions to these problems, and which may compete and cooperate. We trained two rhesus monkeys on a paradigmatic planning task that transparently reveals canonical aspects of different strategies. We performed a detailed behavioral analysis using methods of reinforcement learning on choice and reaction time to reveal conjoint influences and structural interactions of different sources of information. We show the strengths and limitations of these analyses, at the same time as we provide a novel perspective on how different learning systems interact for choice in non-human primates.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Computational Biology", "Decision Making", "Humans", "Models, Theoretical", "Primates"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087528385", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"]], "AuthorData": {"24512443200": {"Name": "Miranda B.", "AuthorID": "24512443200", "AffiliationID": "60021283, 60021696, 60106051", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa"}, "57217862757": {"Name": "Nishantha Malalasekera W.M.", "AuthorID": "57217862757", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, University College London"}, "6603245038": {"Name": "Kennerley S.W.", "AuthorID": "6603245038", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, University College London"}, "8069852700": {"Name": "Behrens T.E.", "AuthorID": "8069852700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "7006914663": {"Name": "Dayan P.", "AuthorID": "7006914663", "AffiliationID": "60084280, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, University College London"}}}
