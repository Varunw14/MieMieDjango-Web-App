This phase 2 trial aimed to assess the efficacy of a Burkitt-like approach for high-risk DLBCL using the dose-intense R-CODOX-M/R-IVAC regimen. Patients and methods: Eligible patients were aged 18\u201365 years with stage II\u2013IV untreated DLBCL and an International Prognostic Index (IPI) score of 3\u20135. Patients received alternating cycles of CODOX-M (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and high-dose methotrexate) alternating with IVAC chemotherapy (ifosfamide, etoposide and high-dose cytarabine) plus eight doses of rituximab. Response was assessed by computed tomography after completing all four cycles of chemotherapy. The primary end point was 2-year progression-free survival (PFS). Results: A total of 111 eligible patients were registered; median age was 50 years, IPI score was 3 (60.4%) or 4/5 (39.6%), 54% had a performance status \u22652 and 9% had central nervous system involvement. A total of 85 patients (76.6%) completed all four cycles of chemotherapy. There were five treatment-related deaths (4.3%), all in patients with performance status of 3 and aged >50 years. Two-year PFS for the whole cohort was 67.9% [90% confidence interval (CI) 59.9\u201374.6] and 2-year overall survival was 76.0% (90% CI 68.5\u201382.0). The ability to tolerate and complete treatment was lower in patients with performance status \u22652 who were aged >50 years, where 2-year PFS was 43.5% (90% CI 27.9\u201358.0). Conclusions: This trial demonstrates that R-CODOX-M/R-IVAC is a feasible and effective regimen for the treatment of younger and/or fit patients with high-risk DLBCL. These encouraging survival rates demonstrate that this regimen warrants further investigation against standard of care.
