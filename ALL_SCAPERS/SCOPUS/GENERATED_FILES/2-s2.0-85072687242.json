A major roadblock has been the lack of a robust, objective means of quantifying sound-driven attentional capture. Here we demonstrate that: (1) a reliable salience scale can be obtained from crowd-sourcing (N = 911), (2) acoustic roughness appears to be a driving feature behind this scaling, consistent with previous reports implicating roughness in the perceptual distinctiveness of sounds, and (3) crowd-sourced auditory salience correlates with objective autonomic measures. Specifically, we show that a salience ranking obtained from online raters correlated robustly with the superior colliculus-mediated ocular freezing response, microsaccadic inhibition (MSI), measured in naive, passively listening human participants (of either sex). More salient sounds evoked earlier and larger MSI, consistent with a faster orienting response. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that MSI reflects a general reorienting response that is evoked by potentially behaviorally important events regardless of their modality.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Microsaccades are small, rapid, fixational eye movements that are measurable with sensitive eye-tracking equipment. We reveal a novel, robust link between microsaccade dynamics and the subjective salience of brief sounds (salience rankings obtained from a large number of participants in an online experiment): Within 300 ms of sound onset, the eyes of naive, passively listening participants demonstrate different microsaccade patterns as a function of the sound's crowd-sourced salience. These results position the superior colliculus (hypothesized to underlie microsaccade generation) as an important brain area to investigate in the context of a putative multimodal salience hub. They also demonstrate an objective means for quantifying auditory salience.", "AuthorKeywords": ["attention", "auditory scene analysis", "microsaccades", "pupil dilation", "superior colliculus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Attention", "Auditory Perception", "Crowdsourcing", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Saccades", "Superior Colliculi", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072687242", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"57210924658": {"Name": "Zhao S.", "AuthorID": "57210924658", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Ear Institute, University College London"}, "57211114296": {"Name": "Yum N.W.", "AuthorID": "57211114296", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Ear Institute, University College London"}, "57211114426": {"Name": "Benjamin L.", "AuthorID": "57211114426", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Ear Institute, University College London"}, "57203303605": {"Name": "Benhamou E.", "AuthorID": "57203303605", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, University College London"}, "56421885800": {"Name": "Yoneya M.", "AuthorID": "56421885800", "AffiliationID": "60025555", "AffiliationName": "NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Atsugi 243-0198 Japan"}, "7401638726": {"Name": "Furukawa S.", "AuthorID": "7401638726", "AffiliationID": "60025555", "AffiliationName": "NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Atsugi 243-0198 Japan"}, "14522185400": {"Name": "Dick F.", "AuthorID": "14522185400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "6701855101": {"Name": "Slaney M.", "AuthorID": "6701855101", "AffiliationID": "60006191", "AffiliationName": "Machine Hearing Research, Google"}, "8953499500": {"Name": "Chait M.", "AuthorID": "8953499500", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Ear Institute, University College London"}}}
