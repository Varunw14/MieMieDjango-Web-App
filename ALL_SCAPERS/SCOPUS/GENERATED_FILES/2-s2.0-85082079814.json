In radiotherapy dosimetry challenges include small-field profile evaluation, encompassing the fine beams of radiosurgery, evaluations confronting the steep dose gradients of electronic brachytherapy and the high dose rates of FLASH radiotherapy. Current work concerns the thermoluminescent dosimetric properties of commercial low-cost borosilicate glass in the form of thin (sub-mm to a few mm) plates, use being made of microscope cover-slips irradiated using clinical external-beam radiotherapy facilities as well as through use of 60Co gamma irradiators. In using megavoltage photons and MeV electrons, characterization of the dosimetric response has been made for cover-slips of thicknesses up to 4 mm. Reproducibility to within +/5% has been obtained. In particular, for doses up to 10 Gy, the borosilicate cover-slips have been demonstrated to have considerable potential for use in high spatial resolution radiotherapy dosimetry, down to 0.13 mm in present work, with a coefficient of determination in respect of linearity of >0.99 for the thinner cover-slips. Results are also presented for 0.13- and 1.00-mm thick cover slips irradiated to 60Co gamma-ray doses, initially in the range 5- to 25 Gy, subsequently extended to 5 kGy\u201325 kGy, again providing linear response.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Borosilicate glass", "Dosimetry", "Radiotherapy", "Thermoluminescence"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dosimetric properties", "Dosimetric response", "External beam radiotherapy", "High spatial resolution", "Megavoltage photons", "Radiation monitoring", "Radiation processing", "Thermoluminescence dosimetry"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082079814", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"]], "AuthorData": {"57212082145": {"Name": "Alqahtani A.", "AuthorID": "57212082145", "AffiliationID": "60104334", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine, University of Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal"}, "57055428300": {"Name": "Alanazi A.", "AuthorID": "57055428300", "AffiliationID": "116240831", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics Department, Cancer Centre, Prince Mohammed Medical City"}, "7006360814": {"Name": "Podolyak Z.", "AuthorID": "7006360814", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Surrey"}, "7403122642": {"Name": "Bradley D.A.", "AuthorID": "7403122642", "AffiliationID": "60107208", "AffiliationName": "Sunway University, Centre for Biomedical Physics, Jalan Universiti"}, "48661322000": {"Name": "Sani S.F.A.", "AuthorID": "48661322000", "AffiliationID": "60029157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, University of Malaya"}, "57215845050": {"Name": "Narissa N.H.A.", "AuthorID": "57215845050", "AffiliationID": "60029157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, University of Malaya"}, "7005065727": {"Name": "Nisbet A.", "AuthorID": "7005065727", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
