Despite perfusion, myocardial edema and time-dependent function degradation are reported. Therefore, monitoring several variables is necessary to identify which of these should be controlled to preserve the heart function. This study presents biochemical, electrophysiological and hemodynamic changes in the PhysioHeart\u2122 to understand the pitfalls of ex vivo slaughterhouse heart hemoperfusion. Methods: Seven porcine hearts were harvested, arrested and revived using the PhysioHeart\u2122. Cardiac output, SaO2, glucose and pH were maintained at physiological levels. Blood analyses were performed hourly and unipolar epicardial electrograms (UEG), pressures and flows were recorded to assess the physiological performance. Results: Normal cardiac performance was attained in terms of mean cardiac output (5.1 \u00b1 1.7 l/min) and pressures but deteriorated over time. Across the experiments, homeostasis was maintained for 171.4 \u00b1 54 min, osmolarity and blood electrolytes increased significantly between 10 and 80%, heart weight increased by 144 \u00b1 41 g, free fatty acids (- 60%), glucose and lactate diminished, ammonia increased by 273 \u00b1 76% and myocardial necrosis and UEG alterations appeared and aggravated. Progressively deteriorating electrophysiological and hemodynamic functions can be explained by reperfusion injury, waste product intoxication (i.e. hyperammonemia), lack of essential nutrients, ion imbalances and cardiac necrosis as a consequence of hepatological and nephrological plasma clearance absence. Conclusions: The PhysioHeart\u2122 is an acute model, suitable for cardiac device and therapy assessment, which can precede conventional animal studies. However, observations indicate that ex vivo slaughterhouse hearts resemble cardiac physiology of deteriorating hearts in a multi-organ failure situation and signalize the need for plasma clearance during perfusion to attenuate time-dependent function degradation. The presented study therefore provides an in-dept understanding of the sources and reasons causing the cardiac function loss, as a first step for future effort to prolong cardiac perfusion in the PhysioHeart\u2122. These findings could be also of potential interest for other cardiac platforms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomarkers", "Cardiac electrophysiology", "Cardiac physiology", "Ex vivo", "Normothermic perfusion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Abattoirs", "Animals", "Energy Metabolism", "Heart", "Hemodynamics", "Isolated Heart Preparation", "Materials Testing", "Models, Animal", "Myocardium", "Necrosis", "Perfusion", "Sus scrofa", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074828921", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57192543135": {"Name": "Kappler B.", "AuthorID": "57192543135", "AffiliationID": "118250154", "AffiliationName": "LifeTec Group B.V"}, "26022350500": {"Name": "De Mol B.A.J.M.", "AuthorID": "26022350500", "AffiliationID": "118250154", "AffiliationName": "LifeTec Group B.V"}, "12765550800": {"Name": "Van Tuijl S.", "AuthorID": "12765550800", "AffiliationID": "118250154", "AffiliationName": "LifeTec Group B.V"}, "35793876100": {"Name": "Stijnen M.", "AuthorID": "35793876100", "AffiliationID": "118250154", "AffiliationName": "LifeTec Group B.V"}, "56519965800": {"Name": "Ledezma C.A.", "AuthorID": "56519965800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "8347053200": {"Name": "Tan P.J.", "AuthorID": "8347053200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "23984658900": {"Name": "D\u00edaz-Zuccarini V.", "AuthorID": "23984658900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "WEISS Centre for Surgical and Interventional Sciences, UCL"}, "55623319600": {"Name": "Meijborg V.", "AuthorID": "55623319600", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biology, Amsterdam University Medical Center"}, "22833345600": {"Name": "Boukens B.J.", "AuthorID": "22833345600", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biology, Amsterdam University Medical Center"}, "24460294200": {"Name": "Ergin B.", "AuthorID": "24460294200", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Translational Physiology, Amsterdam University Medical Center"}, "57202556001": {"Name": "Ince C.", "AuthorID": "57202556001", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Translational Physiology, Amsterdam University Medical Center"}}}
