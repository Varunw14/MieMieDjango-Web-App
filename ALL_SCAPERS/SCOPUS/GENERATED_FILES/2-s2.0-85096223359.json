In this study, six types of composite lattice structures with different strut radius that consist of simple cubic (structure A), body-centered cubic (structure B), and edge-centered cubic (structure C) unit cells are designed. The designed structures are firstly simulated and analysed by the finite element (FE) method. Commercially pure Ti (CP\u2013Ti) lattice structures with optimized unit cells and strut radius are then fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM), and the dimensions, microtopography, and mechanical properties are characterised. The results show that among the six types of composite lattice structures, combined BA, CA, and CB structures exhibit smaller maximum von-Mises stress, indicating that these structures have higher strength. Based on the fitting curves of stress/specific surface area versus strut radius, the optimized strut radius of BA, CA, and CB structures is 0.28, 0.23, and 0.30 mm respectively. Their corresponding compressive yield strength and compressive modulus are 42.28, 30.11, and 176.96 MPa, and 4.13, 2.16, and 7.84 GPa, respectively. The CP-Ti with CB unit structure presents a similar strength and compressive modulus to the cortical bone, which makes it a potential candidate for subchondral bone restorations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Composite lattice structure", "CP-Ti", "Finite element modelling", "Selective laser melting (SLM)"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096223359", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"57190249408": {"Name": "Xu W.", "AuthorID": "57190249408", "AffiliationID": "60014311, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Dental School, University of Bristol"}, "57216882737": {"Name": "Yu A.", "AuthorID": "57216882737", "AffiliationID": "60018273", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Materials Genome Engineering, Institute for Advanced Materials and Technology, State Key Laboratory for Advanced Metals and Materials, University of Science and Technology Beijing"}, "55266994800": {"Name": "Lu X.", "AuthorID": "55266994800", "AffiliationID": "60018273", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Materials Genome Engineering, Institute for Advanced Materials and Technology, State Key Laboratory for Advanced Metals and Materials, University of Science and Technology Beijing"}, "57219018639": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "57219018639", "AffiliationID": "60018273", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Materials Genome Engineering, Institute for Advanced Materials and Technology, State Key Laboratory for Advanced Metals and Materials, University of Science and Technology Beijing"}, "7202660941": {"Name": "Qu X.", "AuthorID": "7202660941", "AffiliationID": "60018273", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Materials Genome Engineering, Institute for Advanced Materials and Technology, State Key Laboratory for Advanced Metals and Materials, University of Science and Technology Beijing"}, "55581409800": {"Name": "Tamaddon M.", "AuthorID": "55581409800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedic & Musculoskeletal Science, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "57188879979": {"Name": "Liu C.", "AuthorID": "57188879979", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedic & Musculoskeletal Science, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "57216671683": {"Name": "Su B.", "AuthorID": "57216671683", "AffiliationID": "60014311, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Dental School, University of Bristol"}, "57219626162": {"Name": "Wang M.", "AuthorID": "57219626162", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Physiology, Pharmacology and Neuroscience, University of Bristol"}, "35217451000": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "35217451000", "AffiliationID": "60018273", "AffiliationName": "School of Metallurgical and Ecological Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing"}}}
