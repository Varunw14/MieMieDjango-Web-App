Method: 14 Catphan phantoms (models 503, 504 and 604) were scanned on a Canon Aquilion Prime CT scanner using a single scan protocol. Measurements were made of noise in the uniformity section, visibility of low contrast targets and contrast, x-ray attenuation and CT number for 5 materials in the sensitometry section. Scans were also acquired using one phantom and varying reconstruction field of view, image slice thickness, effective tube-current-time product and iterative reconstruction settings to determine how the degree of inter-phantom variability compared with the magnitude of changes from scan parameter alteration. Results: Across all phantoms the mean CT value in the uniformity section was 7.0 (SD 0.9) range: 4.9\u20138.1 HU. For the different materials the CT numbers were air: \u22121004 \u00b1 5, Polymethylpentene: \u2212190 \u00b1 2, Polystyrene: \u221242 \u00b1 2, Delrin: 321 \u00b1 5 and Teflon: 898 \u00b1 8 HU. Consistency of low contrast targets through visual scoring was good. Measured contrast was lower (p < 0.001) with more variability for 504 versus 604 models. All phantoms produced identical tube current settings with x-ray tube current modulation, indicating no x-ray attenuation differences. The degree of change in image quality metrics between phantoms was small compared with results when scan parameters were varied. Conclusion: Catphan phantoms model 604 showed minimal differences and will be used for multi-centre inter-comparison work, with the consistency between phantoms appropriate for measuring possible variations in image quality.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Catphan", "Consistency", "CT", "Phantom"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090837392", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56391449800": {"Name": "Davis A.T.", "AuthorID": "56391449800", "AffiliationID": "60030382", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics, Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "36911743100": {"Name": "Palmer A.L.", "AuthorID": "36911743100", "AffiliationID": "60030382", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics, Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "7005065727": {"Name": "Nisbet A.", "AuthorID": "7005065727", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
