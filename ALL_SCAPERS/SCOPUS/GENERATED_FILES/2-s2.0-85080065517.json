In the current study, we assessed the effects of age and cognitive effort on self-monitoring for speech in adolescence, as well as its associations with personality dimensions pertaining to schizotypy and impulsivity. Methods: 121 community adolescents undertook a self-monitoring task that assesses the capacity to discriminate between self-generated overt and silent speech, for items requiring different levels of cognitive effort. Self-report measures were used to assess trait dimensions of schizotypy and impulsivity. Results: Cognitive effort, but not age, contributed to the overall rate of self-monitoring errors. Contrary to clinical psychosis and high risk samples, increased cognitive effort in healthy adolescents led to more internalising than externalising self-monitoring errors. Higher scores on the interpersonal dimension of schizotypy were associated with increases in the total rate of self-monitoring errors. No associations were found between positive schizotypy and externalising self-monitoring misattributions. Finally, trait impulsivity dimensions were not associated with self-monitoring performance. Conclusions: The present findings suggest that self-monitoring confusions may be linked to trait-risk for psychosis in adolescence. Future studies can prospectively assess whether the association between negative schizotypal traits and self-monitoring represents a distal marker of psychosis vulnerability.", "AuthorKeywords": ["personality", "psychosis risk", "schizophrenia", "schizotypy", "Source monitoring"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Age Factors", "Child", "Cognition", "Female", "Humans", "Impulsive Behavior", "Male", "Psychomotor Performance", "Reading", "Schizotypal Personality Disorder", "Self Report", "Speech"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85080065517", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56193455700": {"Name": "Salaminios G.", "AuthorID": "56193455700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "23968434700": {"Name": "Tanzer M.", "AuthorID": "23968434700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "8724552100": {"Name": "Debban\u00e9 M.", "AuthorID": "8724552100", "AffiliationID": "60004718", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Developmental Imaging and Psychopathology Lab, Office Medico-P\u00e9dagogique, University of Geneva 1 rue David-Dufour"}, "57193113176": {"Name": "Morosan L.", "AuthorID": "57193113176", "AffiliationID": "60004718", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Developmental Imaging and Psychopathology Lab, Office Medico-P\u00e9dagogique, University of Geneva 1 rue David-Dufour"}, "57193712388": {"Name": "Toffel E.", "AuthorID": "57193712388", "AffiliationID": "60004718", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Clinical Psychology Unit, Faculty of Psychology, University of Geneva"}, "57203045934": {"Name": "Eliez S.", "AuthorID": "57203045934", "AffiliationID": "60004718", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Developmental Imaging and Psychopathology Lab, Office Medico-P\u00e9dagogique, University of Geneva 1 rue David-Dufour"}}}
