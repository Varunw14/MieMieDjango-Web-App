There is a paucity of randomized controlled trials of interventions supporting people with mild dementia to engage in meaningful and purposeful activity. The aim of this study was to assess whether Behavioral Activation (BA) is an acceptable psychological intervention for people with mild dementia and whether a large-scale trial is feasible. Participants were randomly assigned to BA (n = 42) or treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 21). BA aimed at increasing engagement in enjoyable and meaningful activity, and preventing low mood. Follow-up was at 3 and 6 months. Assessors were blind to treatment allocation (trial registration number: ISRCTN75503960). Retention rate was above 80% at both assessment time points. Treatment acceptability and credibility were high. Depressive symptoms remained unchanged in both groups. There was evidence of improvement associated with BA for every day function (-3.92, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) -6.87 to -0.97), and engagement in meaningful and enjoyable activity (5.08, 95% CI 0.99 to 9.16) post-treatment (3 months) in comparison to TAU. Both carer-rated patient health-related quality of life (0.16, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.28) and physical health (11.31, 95% CI 2.03 to 20.59) showed evidence of improvement at 3 months. Improvements in meaningful and enjoyable activity were maintained at 6 months.BA for people with mild dementia is feasible and acceptable and may be associated with clinically significant changes in function and quality of life. A full scale randomized controlled trial of clinical effectiveness is now needed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acceptability", "activity scheduling", "behavioral activation", "behavioral therapy", "dementia", "feasibility", "low mood", "pleasant events", "randomized controlled trial"], "IndexKeywords": ["Activities of Daily Living", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Dementia", "Depression", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mood Disorders", "Patient Compliance", "Pilot Projects", "Quality of Life", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075813957", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"23397844800": {"Name": "Orgeta V.", "AuthorID": "23397844800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57203542946": {"Name": "Tuijt R.", "AuthorID": "57203542946", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56427480200": {"Name": "Leung P.", "AuthorID": "56427480200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57203541368": {"Name": "Verdaguer E.S.", "AuthorID": "57203541368", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "35452972800": {"Name": "Gould R.L.", "AuthorID": "35452972800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57192098590": {"Name": "Jones R.", "AuthorID": "57192098590", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7006347341": {"Name": "Livingston G.", "AuthorID": "7006347341", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
