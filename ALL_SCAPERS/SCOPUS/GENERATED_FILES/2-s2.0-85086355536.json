In this work we seek to build models of brain age based on functional connectivity while prioritizing model interpretability and understanding. This way, the models serve to both provide accurate estimates of brain age as well as allow us to investigate changes in functional connectivity which occur during the ageing process. The methods proposed in this work consist of a two-step procedure: first, linear latent variable models, such as PCA and its extensions, are employed to learn reproducible functional connectivity networks present across a cohort of subjects. The activity within each network is subsequently employed as a feature in a linear regression model to predict brain age. The proposed framework is employed on the data from the CamCAN repository and the inferred brain age models are further demonstrated to generalize using data from two open-access repositories: the Human Connectome Project and the ATR Wide-Age-Range.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Connectome", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Models, Biological", "Principal Component Analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086355536", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56346664600": {"Name": "Monti R.P.", "AuthorID": "56346664600", "AffiliationID": "60016648", "AffiliationName": "RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project (AIP)"}, "56304285200": {"Name": "Gibberd A.", "AuthorID": "56304285200", "AffiliationID": "60117771, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics & Statistics, Lancaster University"}, "55605775729": {"Name": "Roy S.", "AuthorID": "55605775729", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Bath"}, "13606213400": {"Name": "Nunes M.", "AuthorID": "13606213400", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Bath"}, "56559386700": {"Name": "Lorenz R.", "AuthorID": "56559386700", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Stanford University"}, "22941607300": {"Name": "Leech R.", "AuthorID": "22941607300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuroimaging Science, Kings College London"}, "6603434315": {"Name": "Kawanabe M.", "AuthorID": "6603434315", "AffiliationID": "60001271", "AffiliationName": "Brain Information Communication Research Laboratory Group, Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International (ATR)"}, "57195679196": {"Name": "Ogawa T.", "AuthorID": "57195679196", "AffiliationID": "60001271", "AffiliationName": "Brain Information Communication Research Laboratory Group, Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International (ATR)"}, "7007182085": {"Name": "Hyv\u00e4rinen A.", "AuthorID": "7007182085", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science and HIIT, University of Helsinki"}}}
