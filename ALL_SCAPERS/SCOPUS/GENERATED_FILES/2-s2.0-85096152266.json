Effects of LDL-C-lowering drugs on bone are also controversial. We aim to determine whether LDL-C is linked causally to bone mineral density (BMD) and assess the effects of LDL-C-lowering drugs on BMD. Methods: Association between blood lipid levels and BMD was examined by epidemiological observation analyses in a US representative cohort NHANES III (n = 3638) and the Hong Kong Osteoporosis Study (HKOS; n = 1128). Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR), employing genetic data from a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) of blood lipids (n = 188 577), total body BMD (TB-BMD) (n = 66 628) and estimated BMD (eBMD) (n= 142 487), was performed to infer causality between LDL-C and BMD. Genetic proxies for LDL-C-lowering drugs were used to examine the drugs' effects on BMD. Results: In the NHANES III cohort, each standard deviation (SD) decrease in LDL-C was associated with a 0.045 SD increase in femoral neck BMD (95% CI: 0.009 - 0.081; P = 0.015). A similar increase in BMD was observed in the HKOS at femoral neck and lumbar spine. In MR analysis, a decrease in genetically predicted LDL-C was associated with an increase in TB-BMD {estimate per SD decrease, 0.038 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.002 - 0.074]; P = 0.038} and eBMD [0.076 (0.042 - 0.111); P = 1.20x10-5]. Reduction in TB-BMD was causally associated with increased LDL-C [0.035 (0.033 - 0.066); P = 0.034]. Statins' LDL-C-lowering proxies were associated with increased TB-BMD [0.18 (0.044 - 0.316); P = 9.600x10-3] and eBMD [0.143 (0.062 - 0.223); P = 5.165x10-4]. Conclusions: Negative causal association exists between LDL-C level and BMD. Statins' LDL-C-lowering effect increases BMD, suggesting their protective effect on bone.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bone mineral density", "Coronary artery disease", "Fracture", "LDL-C", "Mendelian randomization", "Statins"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096152266", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"]], "AuthorData": {"35080710200": {"Name": "Li G.H.Y.", "AuthorID": "35080710200", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong"}, "14520953400": {"Name": "Cheung C.L.", "AuthorID": "14520953400", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong"}, "57205744614": {"Name": "Au P.C.M.", "AuthorID": "57205744614", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong"}, "57219845303": {"Name": "Wong I.C.K.", "AuthorID": "57219845303", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Practice and Policy, School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57220537455": {"Name": "Sham P.C.", "AuthorID": "57220537455", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong"}, "8082703100": {"Name": "Tan K.C.B.", "AuthorID": "8082703100", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong"}}}
