We investigated the association of childhood socioeconomic position with depressive symptoms in later adulthood in a Central and Eastern European country. Methods: We analyzed data from the Czech arm of the Health, Alcohol and Psychosocial factors In Eastern Europe (HAPIEE) study. We estimated the associations of three indicators of childhood socioeconomic position (access to household amenities at age of 10 years, father\u00b4s education and mother\u00b4s education) with high depressive symptoms, operationalized as \u226516 points on the Center for Epidemiological Studies \u2013 Depression 20 scale, controlling for age and sex, current socioeconomic position and other social and health-related factors. Results: The analytical sample included 4,213 individuals (mean age 58 years, 54% women). All three indicators of childhood socioeconomic position were inversely associated with depressive symptoms in age-sex adjusted models (p for trends: access to household amenities p<0.001; mother\u00b4s education p<0.001; father\u00b4s education p=0.03). Adjustment for current socioeconomic position attenuated the associations of depressive symptoms with access to household amenities (p for trend 0.04) and mother\u00b4s education (p for trend 0.05) and virtually eliminated the association with father\u00b4s education (p for trend 0.82). Limitations: Individuals with higher depressive symptoms and more adverse socioeconomic position are likely to be underrepresented in the study sample. Data on childhood socioeconomic position may be reported inaccurately. Conclusions: Socioeconomic hardship in childhood may have long-lasting consequences on mental health in later adulthood.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Childhood socioeconomic hardship", "Depressive symptoms", "Epidemiology", "Lifecourse"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084067181", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56018493700": {"Name": "Cermakova P.", "AuthorID": "56018493700", "AffiliationID": "60016605", "AffiliationName": "Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University"}, "57215376753": {"Name": "Pikhart H.", "AuthorID": "57215376753", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health"}, "55855747800": {"Name": "Ruiz M.", "AuthorID": "55855747800", "AffiliationID": "60016605", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Physical Education and Sport, Charles University"}, "7005266289": {"Name": "Bobak M.", "AuthorID": "7005266289", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health"}, "6701399454": {"Name": "Kubinova R.", "AuthorID": "6701399454", "AffiliationID": "60012911", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Public Health"}}}
