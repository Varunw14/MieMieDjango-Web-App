The previously published crystal structure [CSD refcode PHOLHH; Meuthen & von Stackelberg (1960). Z. Elektrochem. 64, 387-390] is shown to be incorrect. Pairs of phenol molecules, related by an inversion centre, are bridged by one water molecule via O - H?O hydrogen bonds; an extended R 4 4(8) hydrogen-bonded motif links these inversion dimers into chains parallel to the c axis. Packing of the chains is achieved by weaker T-shaped C - H?p interactions between nearest neighbour phenol molecules in the bc plane. Analysis of the thermal expansion and parameterization with a Debye model in terms of the linear elastic moduli shows that the c axis is ~3 times stiffer than the two orthogonal directions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DFT", "Hirshfeld surface analysis", "hydrate", "neutron powder diffraction", "phenol", "thermal expansion"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091703227", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"7004475745": {"Name": "Fortes A.D.", "AuthorID": "7004475745", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "Isis Neutron and Muon Spallation Facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}}}
