The dataset for this model is second-by-second emission laboratory measurements, following a real driving cycle that were recorded in urban, suburban and motorway areas of London. The GAMLSS emission model estimates each of CO2, CO and NOx in each second for two different vehicle types (petrol or diesel) using instantaneous speed and acceleration as the explanatory variables. Comparing the results with current emission models indicates substantial improvement in accuracy and quality of estimation by this approach.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Air pollution", "GAMLSS approach", "Vehicle emission modelling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Data-driven model", "Explanatory variables", "GAMLSS approach", "Generalized additive model", "Instantaneous speed", "Laboratory measurements", "Vehicle emission", "Vehicle movements"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072781151", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"]], "AuthorData": {"57211138751": {"Name": "Hajmohammadi H.", "AuthorID": "57211138751", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Transport Studies, Department of Civil, Environment and Geomatics Engineering, University College London"}, "6701695159": {"Name": "Heydecker B.", "AuthorID": "6701695159", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Transport Studies, Department of Civil, Environment and Geomatics Engineering, University College London"}, "36005147900": {"Name": "Marra G.", "AuthorID": "36005147900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}}}
