This open access article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (.The domestication of the yak on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau probably dates back to 7300 years ago, when the rangelands were also utilized for cultivation. Over time, a complete system of herding and rangeland management developed. In recent years, however, the rangeland contract policy and nomadic settlement project have reduced the mobility of herds through the decollectivization of the rangeland. This process has destroyed the traditional nomadic lifestyle and caused difficulties, forcing the herders to adapt to new ways. This paper considers 3 issues: (1) the implementation of the contract policy and the settlement project - 2 important policies that have caused the decollectivization of rangeland on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau; (2) the effects of the 2 policies on herding at 2 sites; and (3) the adaptive strategies employed by herders against the constraints of the policies. The study incorporates a literature review, fieldwork, key-person interviews, and focus group discussions. Community-based self-management of the rangeland appears to be the best strategy for herders. Policies such as group herding can help herders increase herd mobility, which is crucial for sustainably raising livestock on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adaptive strategies", "herding", "nomadic settlement project", "Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau", "rangeland contract policy", "rangeland decollectivization"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089479771", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Development", "SOCI", "3303"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"]], "AuthorData": {"57218545830": {"Name": "Zhe Y.", "AuthorID": "57218545830", "AffiliationID": "60028265", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Grassland and Agro-ecosystems, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University"}, "57218557806": {"Name": "Cili J.", "AuthorID": "57218557806", "AffiliationID": "60028265", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Grassland and Agro-ecosystems, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University"}, "7005945282": {"Name": "Mace R.H.", "AuthorID": "7005945282", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University College London"}, "57218548584": {"Name": "Juan D.", "AuthorID": "57218548584", "AffiliationID": "60028265", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Grassland and Agro-ecosystems, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University"}, "57218552541": {"Name": "Pengpeng B.", "AuthorID": "57218552541", "AffiliationID": "60028265", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Grassland and Agro-ecosystems, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University"}, "54794980500": {"Name": "Guozhen D.", "AuthorID": "54794980500", "AffiliationID": "60028265", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Grassland and Agro-ecosystems, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University"}}}
