The percentage of non-shattering spikelet bases was c. 73% of identifiable visualizations, with c. 27% representing wild types. These analyses demonstrate the domestication of sorghum is significantly earlier than suggested by previous archaeological research. These results also demonstrate that microCT scanning is a major qualitative and quantitative advance on pre-existing methods for the investigation of crop remains in pottery sherds, which hitherto have been reliant on surface impressions; it is non-destructive, provides higher resolution 3D imaging of organic inclusions, and enables greater archaeobotanical recovery of inclusions within a sherd. MicroCT analysis of ceramics, mudbrick and other building materials has considerable potential for improving the chronologies and resolution for the domestication of other cereals in the past.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Archaeobotany", "Domestication episode", "MicroCT visualisation", "Neolithic", "Spikelet base", "Sudan"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092473357", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"57194283308": {"Name": "Barron A.", "AuthorID": "57194283308", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "School of Archaeology and Anthropology, Australian National University"}, "57216600604": {"Name": "Denham T.", "AuthorID": "57216600604", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "School of Archaeology and Anthropology, Australian National University"}, "57208724215": {"Name": "Fuller D.Q.", "AuthorID": "57208724215", "AffiliationID": "60108650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology, Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History"}, "26034718600": {"Name": "Stevens C.", "AuthorID": "26034718600", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "School of Archaeology and Museology, Peking University"}, "55968036900": {"Name": "Champion L.", "AuthorID": "55968036900", "AffiliationID": "60007762", "AffiliationName": "Goethe Universit\u00e4t, Institut f\u00fcr Arch\u00e4ologische Wissenschaften"}, "57196048683": {"Name": "Winchell F.", "AuthorID": "57196048683", "AffiliationID": "112025844", "AffiliationName": "Independent Researcher"}}}
