We ran a virtual Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) for a group of final year students assessing clinical communication skills, written communication, practical skills, examination skills and professionalism. OSCEs provide the opportunity to test skills that written papers cannot, so it was important to include such a clinical exam in the portfolio of assessments for graduating students. The virtual OSCE ran smoothly and was successful at discriminating between candidates. In this article, we share twelve practical tips from our experience and the small body of literature on how to successfully design and deliver a virtual OSCE. This format provides an opportunity to run similar assessments in the future if remote assessments or assessments of telemedicine skills are required.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clinical", "computer-based", "OSCE"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85093100330", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"57192872990": {"Name": "Hopwood J.", "AuthorID": "57192872990", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Medical School, UCL"}, "54792133900": {"Name": "Myers G.", "AuthorID": "54792133900", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Medical School, UCL"}, "13614108300": {"Name": "Sturrock A.", "AuthorID": "13614108300", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Medical School, UCL"}}}
