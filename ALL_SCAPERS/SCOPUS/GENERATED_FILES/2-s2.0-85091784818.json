Characterising the circuit architecture of these diseases could illuminate both their pathophysiology and the computational architecture of the cognitive processes they target. However, this is challenging using standard neuroimaging techniques. Here we addressed this issue using a novel technique\u2014spectral dynamic causal modelling\u2014that estimates the effective connectivity between brain regions from resting-state fMRI data. We studied patients with semantic dementia\u2014the paradigmatic disorder of the brain system mediating world knowledge\u2014relative to healthy older individuals. We assessed how the effective connectivity of the semantic appraisal network targeted by this disease was modulated by pathogenic protein deposition and by two key phenotypic factors, semantic impairment and behavioural disinhibition. The presence of pathogenic protein in SD weakened the normal inhibitory self-coupling of network hubs in both antero-mesial temporal lobes, with development of an abnormal excitatory fronto-temporal projection in the left cerebral hemisphere. Semantic impairment and social disinhibition were linked to a similar but more extensive profile of abnormally attenuated inhibitory self-coupling within temporal lobe regions and excitatory projections between temporal and inferior frontal regions. Our findings demonstrate that population-level dynamic causal modelling can disclose a core pathophysiological feature of proteinopathic network architecture\u2014attenuation of inhibitory connectivity\u2014and the key elements of distributed neuronal processing that underwrite semantic memory.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Female", "Frontotemporal Dementia", "Functional Neuroimaging", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Models, Neurological", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Neural Pathways", "Neuropsychological Tests"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091784818", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57203303605": {"Name": "Benhamou E.", "AuthorID": "57203303605", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "56402543600": {"Name": "Marshall C.R.", "AuthorID": "56402543600", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Preventive Neurology Unit, Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57194327207": {"Name": "Russell L.L.", "AuthorID": "57194327207", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57038112100": {"Name": "Hardy C.J.D.", "AuthorID": "57038112100", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57188569347": {"Name": "Bond R.L.", "AuthorID": "57188569347", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "55236542200": {"Name": "Sivasathiaseelan H.", "AuthorID": "55236542200", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57207115089": {"Name": "Greaves C.V.", "AuthorID": "57207115089", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "14020386900": {"Name": "Rohrer J.D.", "AuthorID": "14020386900", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "35557252600": {"Name": "Warren J.D.", "AuthorID": "35557252600", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "36080215500": {"Name": "Friston K.J.", "AuthorID": "36080215500", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "25031569200": {"Name": "Razi A.", "AuthorID": "25031569200", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Turner Institute for Brain and Mental Health, School of Psychological Sciences and Monash Biomedical Imaging, Monash University"}}}
