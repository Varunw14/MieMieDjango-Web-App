Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimMetal oxide nanoparticles have emerged as exceptionally potent biomedical sensors and actuators due to their unique physicochemical features. Despite fascinating achievements, the current limited understanding of the molecular interplay between nanoparticles and the surrounding tissue remains a major obstacle in the rationalized development of nanomedicines, which is reflected in their poor clinical approval rate. This work reports on the nanoscopic characterization of inorganic nanoparticles in tissue by the example of complex metal oxide nanoparticle hybrids consisting of crystalline cerium oxide and the biodegradable ceramic bioglass. A validated analytical method based on semiquantitative X-ray fluorescence and inductively coupled plasma spectrometry is used to assess nanoparticle biodistribution following intravenous and topical application. Then, a correlative multiscale analytical cascade based on a combination of microscopy and spectroscopy techniques shows that the topically applied hybrid nanoparticles remain at the initial site and are preferentially taken up into macrophages, form apatite on their surface, and lead to increased accumulation of lipids in their surroundings. Taken together, this work displays how modern analytical techniques can be harnessed to gain unprecedented insights into the biodistribution and biotransformation of complex inorganic nanoparticles. Such nanoscopic characterization is imperative for the rationalized engineering of safe and efficacious nanoparticle-based systems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["analytical imaging", "biological fate", "multiscale", "nanosafety", "spectral unmixing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Complex metal oxides", "Hybrid nanoparticle", "Inductively coupled plasma spectrometry", "Inorganic nanoparticle", "Metal oxide nanoparticles", "Multi scale analysis", "Nanoparticle biodistribution", "Physicochemical features"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087204214", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)", "BIOC", "1301"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57191892568": {"Name": "Matter M.T.", "AuthorID": "57191892568", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Nanoparticle Systems Engineering Laboratory, Institute of Process Engineering, Department of Mechanical and Process Engineering, ETH Zurich"}, "57210847864": {"Name": "Li J.H.", "AuthorID": "57210847864", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Nanoparticle Systems Engineering Laboratory, Institute of Process Engineering, Department of Mechanical and Process Engineering, ETH Zurich"}, "56426539200": {"Name": "Keevend K.", "AuthorID": "56426539200", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Nanoparticle Systems Engineering Laboratory, Institute of Process Engineering, Department of Mechanical and Process Engineering, ETH Zurich"}, "57195576312": {"Name": "Tsolaki E.", "AuthorID": "57195576312", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London (UCL), Malet Place Engineering Building"}, "28367653500": {"Name": "Herrmann I.K.", "AuthorID": "28367653500", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Nanoparticle Systems Engineering Laboratory, Institute of Process Engineering, Department of Mechanical and Process Engineering, ETH Zurich"}, "57204787787": {"Name": "Lese I.", "AuthorID": "57204787787", "AffiliationID": "60010987, 60020486", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic and Hand Surgery, University Hospital Bern (Inselspital), University of Bern"}, "37067764400": {"Name": "Olariu R.", "AuthorID": "37067764400", "AffiliationID": "60010987, 60020486", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic and Hand Surgery, University Hospital Bern (Inselspital), University of Bern"}, "36830684800": {"Name": "Constantinescu M.A.", "AuthorID": "36830684800", "AffiliationID": "60010987, 60020486", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic and Hand Surgery, University Hospital Bern (Inselspital), University of Bern"}, "8645984500": {"Name": "Schreiner C.", "AuthorID": "8645984500", "AffiliationID": "60020086", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Analytical Technologies, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (Empa)"}, "57217423961": {"Name": "Hubeli J.", "AuthorID": "57217423961", "AffiliationID": "60020086", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Analytical Technologies, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (Empa)"}, "23034667200": {"Name": "Figi R.", "AuthorID": "23034667200", "AffiliationID": "60020086", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Analytical Technologies, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (Empa)"}, "16314849400": {"Name": "Bernard L.", "AuthorID": "16314849400", "AffiliationID": "60020086", "AffiliationName": "Nanoscale Materials, Department of Materials Meet Life, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (Empa)"}, "26531780900": {"Name": "Scholder O.", "AuthorID": "26531780900", "AffiliationID": "60020086", "AffiliationName": "Nanoscale Materials, Department of Materials Meet Life, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (Empa)"}, "35323732000": {"Name": "Bertazzo S.", "AuthorID": "35323732000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London (UCL), Malet Place Engineering Building"}, "57202774056": {"Name": "Bertero E.", "AuthorID": "57202774056", "AffiliationID": "60020086", "AffiliationName": "Mechanics of Materials and Nanostructures, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (Empa)"}, "6602353346": {"Name": "Zboray R.", "AuthorID": "6602353346", "AffiliationID": "60020086", "AffiliationName": "Center for X-ray Analytics, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (Empa)"}}}
