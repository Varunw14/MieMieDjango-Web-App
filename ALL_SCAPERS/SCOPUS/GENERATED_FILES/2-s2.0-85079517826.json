The dark-field (or ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering) image is known to provide information on sample micro-structure at length scales that are smaller than the system's spatial resolution, averaged over its length. By using a custom-built groove sample, we show how this can also be exploited to detect individual, isolated features. While these are highlighted in the dark-field image, they remain invisible to the phase and attenuation contrast channels. Finally, we show images of a memory SD card as an indication towards potential applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dark-field imaging", "Phase-contrast imaging", "X-ray imaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Attenuation contrast", "Dark field images", "Dark field imaging", "Phase-contrast imaging", "Spatial resolution", "Ultra small angle x ray scattering", "X-ray phase-contrast imaging", "Xray imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079517826", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"]], "AuthorData": {"57214937239": {"Name": "Matsunaga N.", "AuthorID": "57214937239", "AffiliationID": "60018131", "AffiliationName": "Optical Research Laboratory, Nikon Corporation, Yokohama Plant"}, "57214934064": {"Name": "Yano K.", "AuthorID": "57214934064", "AffiliationID": "60018131", "AffiliationName": "Optical Research Laboratory, Nikon Corporation, Yokohama Plant"}, "35067989100": {"Name": "Endrizzi M.", "AuthorID": "35067989100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004072469": {"Name": "Olivo A.", "AuthorID": "7004072469", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
