To aid this process we propose an automated technique to highlight abnormal brain tissue while accommodating normal developmental changes. To train a developmental model, we used 185 T2 weighted neuroimaging datasets from healthy controls and preterm infants without obvious lesions on MRI age range = 27 + 5 \u2212 51 (median = 40 + 5) weeks + days post menstrual age (PMA). We then tested the model on 39 preterm subjects with known pathology age range = 25 + 1 \u2212 37 + 5 (median = 33) weeks PMA + days. We used voxel-wise Gaussian processes (GP) to model age (PMA) and sex against voxel intensity, where each GP outputs a predicted mean intensity and variance for that location. All GP outputs were combined to synthesize a \u2018normal\u2019 T2 image and corresponding variance map for age and sex. A Z-score map was created by calculating the difference between the neonate\u2019s actual image and their synthesized image and scaling by the standard deviation (SD). With a threshold of 3 SD the model highlighted pathologies including germinal matrix, intraventricular and cerebellar hemorrhage, cystic periventricular leukomalacia and punctate lesions. Statistical analysis of the abnormality detection produces an average AUC value of 0.956 and 0.943 against two raters\u2019 manual segmentations. The proposed method is effective at highlighting different abnormalities across the whole brain in the perinatal period while limiting false positives.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Abnormality detection", "Gaussian processes", "Neonatal imaging", "Normative modeling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Abnormality detection", "Automated techniques", "Automatic Detection", "Brain abnormalities", "Cerebellar hemorrhage", "Developmental changes", "Developmental models", "Periventricular leukomalacia"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092707644", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57219437610": {"Name": "Macleod R.", "AuthorID": "57219437610", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Developing Brain, School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "57218539275": {"Name": "O\u2019Muircheartaigh J.", "AuthorID": "57218539275", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neurodevelopmental Disorders, King\u2019s College London"}, "35414766400": {"Name": "Edwards A.D.", "AuthorID": "35414766400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Developing Brain, School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "55165088800": {"Name": "Rutherford M.", "AuthorID": "55165088800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Developing Brain, School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "7005059142": {"Name": "Counsell S.J.", "AuthorID": "7005059142", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Developing Brain, School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "8588211000": {"Name": "Carmichael D.", "AuthorID": "8588211000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering, School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}}}
