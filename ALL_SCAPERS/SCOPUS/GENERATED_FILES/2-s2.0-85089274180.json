The recent introduction of the OrbiSIMS has significantly improved the utility for biological imaging through combining subcellular spatial resolution with high-performance Orbitrap mass spectrometry. SIMS instruments operate in high-vacuum, and samples are typically analyzed in a freeze-dried state. Consequently, the molecular and structural information may not be well-preserved. We report a method for molecular imaging of biological materials, preserved in a native state, by using an OrbiSIMS instrument equipped with cryogenic sample handling and a high-pressure freezing protocol compatible with mass spectrometry. The performance is demonstrated by imaging a challenging sample (>90% water) of a mature Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm in its native state. The 3D distribution of quorum sensing signaling molecules, nucleobases, and bacterial membrane molecules is revealed with high spatial-resolution and high mass-resolution. We discover that analysis in the frozen-hydrated state yields a 10 \u00bb000-fold increase in signal intensity for polar molecules such as amino acids, which has important implications for SIMS imaging of metabolites and pharmaceuticals.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["3-D molecular imaging", "Bacterial membranes", "High spatial resolution", "High-pressure freezing", "Orbitrap mass spectrometries", "Pseudomonas aeruginosa", "Signaling molecules", "Structural information"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089274180", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"]], "AuthorData": {"57218477250": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "57218477250", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "NiCE-MSI, National Physical Laboratory"}, "57214510255": {"Name": "Gilmore I.S.", "AuthorID": "57214510255", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University of Nottingham"}, "24485114400": {"Name": "Rakowska P.D.", "AuthorID": "24485114400", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "NiCE-MSI, National Physical Laboratory"}, "57211621348": {"Name": "Brown J.", "AuthorID": "57211621348", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Biodiscovery Institute and School of Life Sciences, University of Nottingham, University Park"}, "57213789640": {"Name": "Williams P.", "AuthorID": "57213789640", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Biodiscovery Institute and School of Life Sciences, University of Nottingham, University Park"}, "7003414719": {"Name": "Hardie K.R.", "AuthorID": "7003414719", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Biodiscovery Institute and School of Life Sciences, University of Nottingham, University Park"}, "8426889000": {"Name": "Scurr D.J.", "AuthorID": "8426889000", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University of Nottingham"}, "7402334369": {"Name": "Alexander M.R.", "AuthorID": "7402334369", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University of Nottingham"}, "56278053600": {"Name": "Bullen A.", "AuthorID": "56278053600", "AffiliationID": "60011326", "AffiliationName": "UCL Ear Institute"}, "19934056000": {"Name": "Maclellan-Gibson K.", "AuthorID": "19934056000", "AffiliationID": "60000365", "AffiliationName": "Biological Imaging Group, National Institute for Biological Standards and Controls"}}}
