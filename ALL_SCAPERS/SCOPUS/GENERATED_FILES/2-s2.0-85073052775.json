Two simple cyclic amine substrates gave diastereomerically pure rearranged products in 65 and 90% yields by refluxing in HFIP. A more general procedure used Gd(OTf)3 as a catalyst and successfully rearranged other cyclic and acyclic amines in 42\u201384% yield with diastereomeric ratios of 75:25 to >95:5 in favour of the anti-diastereoisomer (9 examples). Two examples of sulphur containing heterocycles gave lower yields of 9 and 25%. Electron withdrawing substituents were shown to have a deleterious effect on the success of the reaction. The results indicated the limitation of the [1,5]-hydride shift nitro-Mannich reaction with respect to the stability of the intermediate iminium ion.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gd(OTf)3 catalysis", "HFIP promoted", "Nitro-Mannich", "Tetrahydroquinolines", "[1,5]-hydride shift"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073052775", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"55553734284": {"Name": "Anderson J.", "AuthorID": "55553734284", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57205096007": {"Name": "Chang C.", "AuthorID": "57205096007", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57190374593": {"Name": "Corpinot M.", "AuthorID": "57190374593", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57211229437": {"Name": "Ware O.", "AuthorID": "57211229437", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57211229362": {"Name": "Nunn M.", "AuthorID": "57211229362", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "Early Chemical Development, Pharmaceutical Sciences, R&D, AstraZeneca"}}}
