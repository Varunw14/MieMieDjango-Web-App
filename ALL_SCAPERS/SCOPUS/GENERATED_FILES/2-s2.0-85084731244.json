It argues that academics, security professionals and policymakers have given very little consideration to the complexity of these linkages; understanding how human errors can create hidden modes of failure that can be exploited by terrorists and other threat groups. This paper discusses how the literatures in other related fields can be used to explain how human-mediated errors are created and incubated, and how these error types can evolve to become system vulnerabilities and exploitable modes of aviation security failure. The paper concludes by identifying a significant gap in the current theoretical discourse. Implications for actionable policy and research recommendations include taking a fresh approach to proactively mitigating risk; implementing an over-arching risk management strategy which includes analysing data relating to aviation security failures and developing predictive models to detect abnormal and sub-optimal security performance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aviation security", "Human error", "Literature review", "System failure"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084731244", "SubjectAreas": [["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Safety Research", "SOCI", "3311"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"], ["Management Science and Operations Research", "DECI", "1803"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"55624953600": {"Name": "McFarlane P.", "AuthorID": "55624953600", "AffiliationID": "60090044, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Jill Dando Institute of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}}}
