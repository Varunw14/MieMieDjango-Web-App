Such deficits are associated with the increased incidence of falls which in turn is linked with substantial limited functionality and morbidity. Vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) as a component of the treatment has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms and improving balance. HOLOBALANCE is an intervention based on a novel technology platform for providing VRT unsupervised, at home which means that motivating citizens to be compliant and promoting empowerment are the cornerstones for its wide adoption. Here we present how citizens empowerment is being addressed in HOLOBALANCE.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Empowerment", "Human machine interaction", "Vestibular rehabilitation therapy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Empowerment", "Human machine interaction", "Technology platforms", "Vestibular reha-bilitation"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075871275", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"36975570100": {"Name": "Gatsios D.", "AuthorID": "36975570100", "AffiliationID": "60029082, 60004716", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, School of Medicine, University of Ioannina"}, "35774284900": {"Name": "Georga E.I.", "AuthorID": "35774284900", "AffiliationID": "60004716", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Medical Technology and Intelligent Information Systems, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Ioannina"}, "56429645100": {"Name": "Kourou K.K.", "AuthorID": "56429645100", "AffiliationID": "60004716", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Medical Technology and Intelligent Information Systems, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Ioannina"}, "56252054300": {"Name": "Tsiouris K.M.", "AuthorID": "56252054300", "AffiliationID": "60002947", "AffiliationName": "School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens"}, "57192820400": {"Name": "Fotiadis D.I.", "AuthorID": "57192820400", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Research, IMBB-FORTH"}, "6701719104": {"Name": "Bamiou D.E.", "AuthorID": "6701719104", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60011326", "AffiliationName": "UCL Ear Institute & University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre Hearing & Deafness"}, "8916108100": {"Name": "Costafreda S.", "AuthorID": "8916108100", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60011326", "AffiliationName": "UCL Ear Institute & University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre Hearing & Deafness"}, "8907555000": {"Name": "Exarchos T.", "AuthorID": "8907555000", "AffiliationID": "60013925", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, Ionian University"}}}
