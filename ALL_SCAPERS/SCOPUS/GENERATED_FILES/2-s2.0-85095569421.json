All rights reserved.Much has changed in the two decades since I (JL) proposed that scientists should re-examine their obligations to society in order to serve society better. Today, more environmental scientists are actively sharing their science broadly, conducting use-inspired science (sensu Stokes) in addition to basic science, engaging with society, and crafting solutions to problems not just diagnosing them\u2014all very welcome and exciting developments. For the most part, however, environmental scientists have taken on these extra duties because they believed it was the right thing to do and despite the considerable impediments that exist within academia. But make no mistake, the culture of academia continues to impede progress. As a result, although the above actions have had demonstrable effect, their collective impact falls far short of what is needed if society is to tackle effectively the disruption underway due to climate change, ocean acidification, biodiversity loss, pandemics, and more. Actions by individuals can take us only so far. To truly help society meet its grand challenges, environmental scientists must now make a quantum leap in engagement with society. It is time for strategic, collective action to change the culture of academia and create the enabling conditions for science to serve society better.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Climate change", "Social contract for science", "Use-inspired science"], "IndexKeywords": ["Basic science", "Biodiversity loss", "Collective action", "Environmental scientists", "Grand Challenge", "Ocean acidifications", "Quantum leaps", "Social contract"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095569421", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"6701631227": {"Name": "Lubchenco J.", "AuthorID": "6701631227", "AffiliationID": "60013402", "AffiliationName": "Oregon State University"}, "7004227090": {"Name": "Rapley C.", "AuthorID": "7004227090", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
