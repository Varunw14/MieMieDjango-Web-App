Methods: The case-study was built based on the presentations and discussions at an international workshop on TB elimination in low incidence countries organized by the Ministry of Health, Oman, which took place from September 5 to September 7, 2019, and supported by the WHO and European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID). Results: Existing tools were reviewed, including the screening of migrants for latent TB infection (LTBI) with interferon-gamma release assays, clinical examination for active pulmonary TB (APTB) including chest X-rays, organization of laboratory services, and the existing centres for mandatory health examination of pre-arrival or arriving migrants, including examination for APTB. The need for public\u2013private partnerships to handle the burden of screening arriving migrants for active TB was discussed at length and different models for financing were reviewed. Conclusions: In a country with a high proportion of migrants from high endemic countries, screening for LTBI is of high priority. Molecular typing and the development of public\u2013private partnerships are needed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Care", "Control", "Latent TB infection", "Migrants", "Prevention", "Screening",
