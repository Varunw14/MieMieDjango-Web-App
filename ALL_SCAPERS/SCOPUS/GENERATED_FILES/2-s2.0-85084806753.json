In this study, we aimed to determine which training conditions facilitate relational transfer in a relatively simple (patterning) discrimination versus a relatively complex (biconditional) discrimination. The amount of training participants received had little influence on rates of relational transfer. Instead, trial-sequencing of the training contingencies influenced relational transfer in different ways depending on the complexity of the discrimination. Clustering instances of relational rules together during training improved transfer of both simpler patterning and more difficult biconditional rules, regardless of individual differences in cognitive reflection. However, blocking all trials of the same type together improved rule transfer only for biconditional discriminations. Individual differences in cognitive reflection were also more predictive of relational rule use under suboptimal training conditions. The results highlight the need for comprehensive accounts of relational learning to consider how learning conditions and individual differences affect the likelihood of engaging in learning relational structures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Complex discriminations", "Individual differences", "Relational transfer", "Trial-sequencing"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084806753", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"56478680600": {"Name": "Don H.J.", "AuthorID": "56478680600", "AffiliationID": "60020547", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Texas A and M University"}, "12775675500": {"Name": "Goldwater M.B.", "AuthorID": "12775675500", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, The University of Sydney"}, "57208567475": {"Name": "Greenaway J.K.", "AuthorID": "57208567475", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, The University of Sydney"}, "56572427800": {"Name": "Hutchings R.", "AuthorID": "56572427800", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, The University of Sydney"}, "23492797600": {"Name": "Livesey E.J.", "AuthorID": "23492797600", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, The University of Sydney"}}}
