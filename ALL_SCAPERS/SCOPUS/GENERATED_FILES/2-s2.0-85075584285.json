Latterly, research has explored the application of similar ideas to new problems at larger scales. Many of these studies relate to global challenges with significant policy implications. Here, we present an example in the form of original empirical work concerning forced migration associated with the current Syrian refugee crisis. We employ a spatial interaction framework to examine the flows of migrants fleeing Syria and the characteristics which influence their choice of destination country. In line with the broader literature, we find that shorter distances, economic prosperity, and cultural similarity (e.g. shared language) attract forced migrants, as does the probability of being granted asylum; a finding with potential implications for policy. Contrary to expectation, we find little influence for levels of security in potential host nations (e.g. absence of terrorism).", "AuthorKeywords": ["conflict", "migration", "Refugees", "spatial interaction"], "IndexKeywords": ["conflict", "Economic prosperity", "Global challenges", "migration", "Policy implications", "Refugees", "Shared language", "Spatial interaction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075584285", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"], ["History and Philosophy of Science", "ARTS", "1207"]], "AuthorData": {"57193606425": {"Name": "Frith M.", "AuthorID": "57193606425", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}, "55605786800": {"Name": "Davies T.", "AuthorID": "55605786800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}, "8894355600": {"Name": "Johnson S.", "AuthorID": "8894355600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}, "57203465555": {"Name": "Simon M.", "AuthorID": "57203465555", "AffiliationID": "60001359", "AffiliationName": "Department of Government, University of Essex"}, "10642373900": {"Name": "Braithwaite A.", "AuthorID": "10642373900", "AffiliationID": "60010065", "AffiliationName": "School of Government and Public Policy, University of Arizona"}}}
