Altered emotion-attention interactions have been associated with symptoms of affective disturbances, and emerging research focuses on improving emotion-attention interactions to prevent or treat affective disorders. In line with the Human Affectome Project's emphasis on linguistic components, we also analyzed the language used to describe attention-related aspects of emotion, and highlighted terms related to domains such as conscious awareness, motivational effects of attention, social attention, and emotion regulation. These terms were discussed within a broader review of available evidence regarding the neural correlates of (1) Emotion-Attention Interactions in Perception, (2) Emotion-Attention Interactions in Learning and Memory, (3) Individual Differences in Emotion-Attention Interactions, and (4) Training and Interventions to Optimize Emotion-Attention Interactions. This comprehensive approach enabled an integrative overview of the current knowledge regarding the mechanisms of emotion-attention interactions at multiple levels of analysis, and identification of emerging directions for future investigations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Affective neuroscience", "Attention", "Emotion", "Health and well-being", "Individual differences", "Learning and memory", "Linguistics", "Neuroimaging", "Perception", "Psychophysiology", "Training interventions"], "IndexKeywords": ["Affective Symptoms", "Attention", "Emotions", "Humans", "Individuality", "Learning", "Mood Disorders", "Psychotherapy", "Social Cognition"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071965939", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"55952452700": {"Name": "Dolcos F.", "AuthorID": "55952452700", "AffiliationID": "60000745", "AffiliationName": "Beckman Institute for Advanced Science & Technology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"}, "56509238100": {"Name": "Katsumi Y.", "AuthorID": "56509238100", "AffiliationID": "60000745", "AffiliationName": "Beckman Institute for Advanced Science & Technology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"}, "57198516208": {"Name": "Moore M.", "AuthorID": "57198516208", "AffiliationID": "60000745", "AffiliationName": "Beckman Institute for Advanced Science & Technology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"}, "6507640091": {"Name": "Dolcos S.", "AuthorID": "6507640091", "AffiliationID": "60000745", "AffiliationName": "Beckman Institute for Advanced Science & Technology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"}, "54928920400": {"Name": "Berggren N.", "AuthorID": "54928920400", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "6602133918": {"Name": "Derakshan N.", "AuthorID": "6602133918", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "55172605400": {"Name": "de Gelder B.", "AuthorID": "55172605400", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Maastricht University"}, "7005896430": {"Name": "Hamm A.O.", "AuthorID": "7005896430", "AffiliationID": "60021311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological and Clinical Psychology/Psychotherapy, University of Greifswald"}, "7006735833": {"Name": "Koster E.H.W.", "AuthorID": "7006735833", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental-Clinical and Health Psychology, Ghent University"}, "6602536859": {"Name": "Ladouceur C.D.", "AuthorID": "6602536859", "AffiliationID": "60028131, 60015543", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, University of Pittsburgh, Medical Center, University of Pittsburgh"}, "16043157800": {"Name": "Okon-Singer H.", "AuthorID": "16043157800", "AffiliationID": "60002999", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Haifa"}, "57212220763": {"Name": "Richter T.", "AuthorID": "57212220763", "AffiliationID": "60002999", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Haifa"}, "6701800620": {"Name": "Pegna A.J.", "AuthorID": "6701800620", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Queensland"}, "26635865900": {"Name": "Schweizer S.", "AuthorID": "26635865900", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience (Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience Group), University College London"}, "21834885100": {"Name": "Van den Stock J.", "AuthorID": "21834885100", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Translational Neuropsychiatry, Research Group Psychiatry, Department of Neurosciences, KU Leuven"}, "56941894400": {"Name": "Ventura-Bort C.", "AuthorID": "56941894400", "AffiliationID": "60021763", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Potsdam"}, "27968236600": {"Name": "Weymar M.", "AuthorID": "27968236600", "AffiliationID": "60021763", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Potsdam"}}}
