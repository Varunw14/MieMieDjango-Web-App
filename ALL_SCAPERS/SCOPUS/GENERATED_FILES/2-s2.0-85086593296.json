Clear anisotropies of varying magnitudes have been found on different sites on the limbs and less consistently on other parts of the body, with anisotropies on the center of the forehead, but not on the belly. Reported anisotropies on the center of the forehead, however, might reflect an artefact of categorical perception from the face midline, which might be comparable to the expansion of tactile distance perception observed for stimuli presented across joint boundaries. To test whether tactile anisotropy is indeed a general characteristic of the tactile representation of the face, we assessed the perceived distance between pairs of touches on the cheeks and three locations on the forehead: left, right, and center. Consistent with previous results, a clear anisotropy was apparent on the center of the forehead. Importantly, similar anisotropies were also evident on the left and right sides of the forehead and both cheeks. These results provide evidence that anisotropy of perceived tactile distance is not a specific feature of tactile organization at the limbs but it also exists for the face, and further suggest that the spatial distortions found for tactile distances that extend across multiple body parts are not present for stimuli that extend across the body midline.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anisotropy", "Categorical perception", "Distance perception", "Face", "Tactile perception"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anisotropy", "Distance Perception", "Hand", "Humans", "Touch", "Touch Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086593296", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"15765869300": {"Name": "Longo M.R.", "AuthorID": "15765869300", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "57210762536": {"Name": "Amoruso E.", "AuthorID": "57210762536", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "55589526400": {"Name": "Calzolari E.", "AuthorID": "55589526400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Neuro-Otology Unit, Division of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London"}, "57191495669": {"Name": "Ben Yehuda M.", "AuthorID": "57191495669", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford"}, "7005933195": {"Name": "Haggard P.", "AuthorID": "7005933195", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "15135145500": {"Name": "Aza\u00f1\u00f3n E.", "AuthorID": "15135145500", "AffiliationID": "60020075", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioral Neurology, Leibniz Institute for Neurobiology"}}}
