It is believed that advanced modulation formats and digital-To-Analog converters (DACs) will be employed in next generation short-reach transceivers. Digital pre-emphasis techniques are widely employed in DAC-based transceivers to compensate for the high frequency roll-off due to the RF and optoelectronics components in optical transceivers. However, digital pre-emphasis essentially reduces the magnitude of the signal low frequency components for a flat frequency response, which unavoidably increases quantization error, reducing the overall signal-To-noise ratio. This trade-off between SNR and bandwidth conflicts with the high SNR requirement of advanced modulation formats such as the Nyquist-shaped pulse amplitude modulation (PAM). To mitigate the quantization error induced SNR degradation, we show that analog pre-emphasis filters can be used in conjunction with digital pre-emphasis for improved system performance. To understand the impact of the analog pre-emphasis filter on system performance, we analyze the relationship between the flatness of the system frequency response and the SNR degradation due to digital pre-emphasis, and demonstrate 1.1-dB increase of receiver sensitivities, for both 64-Gb/s and 128-Gb/s intensity-modulation direct detection (IM-DD) PAM4 signals, respectively employing a directly modulated laser (DML) and an electroabsorption modulator (EAM).", "AuthorKeywords": ["data center interconnection", "digital pre-emphasis", "digital signal processing (DSP)", "directly-modulated laser (DML)", "dxternally-modulated laser (EML)", "Optical transmitter", "pulse amplitude modulation (PAM)", "RF equalization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Data centers", "Digital signal processing (DSP)", "Directly modulated lasers", "Modulated lasers", "Pre-emphasis", "Pulse amplitude modulations (PAM)", "RF equalization"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082174173", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57204608011": {"Name": "Zhou Z.", "AuthorID": "57204608011", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57201434475": {"Name": "Odedeyi T.", "AuthorID": "57201434475", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003497031": {"Name": "Darwazeh I.", "AuthorID": "7003497031", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56115496300": {"Name": "Liu Z.", "AuthorID": "56115496300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7202842456": {"Name": "Kelly B.", "AuthorID": "7202842456", "AffiliationID": "60120418", "AffiliationName": "Eblana Photonics Ltd., D\u00fan Laoghaire"}, "22981249400": {"Name": "O'Carroll J.", "AuthorID": "22981249400", "AffiliationID": "60120418", "AffiliationName": "Eblana Photonics Ltd., D\u00fan Laoghaire"}, "57195214001": {"Name": "Phelan R.", "AuthorID": "57195214001", "AffiliationID": "60120418", "AffiliationName": "Eblana Photonics Ltd., D\u00fan Laoghaire"}}}
