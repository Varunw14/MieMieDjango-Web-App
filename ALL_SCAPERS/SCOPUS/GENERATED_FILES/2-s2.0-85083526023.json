We explore the psychological, social, and neuroscientific effects of COVID-19 and set out the immediate priorities and longer-term strategies for mental health science research. These priorities were informed by surveys of the public and an expert panel convened by the UK Academy of Medical Sciences and the mental health research charity, MQ: Transforming Mental Health, in the first weeks of the pandemic in the UK in March, 2020. We urge UK research funding agencies to work with researchers, people with lived experience, and others to establish a high level coordination group to ensure that these research priorities are addressed, and to allow new ones to be identified over time. The need to maintain high-quality research standards is imperative. International collaboration and a global perspective will be beneficial. An immediate priority is collecting high-quality data on the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic across the whole population and vulnerable groups, and on brain function, cognition, and mental health of patients with COVID-19. There is an urgent need for research to address how mental health consequences for vulnerable groups can be mitigated under pandemic conditions, and on the impact of repeated media consumption and health messaging around COVID-19. Discovery, evaluation, and refinement of mechanistically driven interventions to address the psychological, social, and neuroscientific aspects of the pandemic are required. Rising to this challenge will require integration across disciplines and sectors, and should be done together with people with lived experience. New funding will be required to meet these priorities, and it can be efficiently leveraged by the UK's world-leading infrastructure. This Position Paper provides a strategy that may be both adapted for, and integrated with, research efforts in other countries.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Coronavirus Infections", "Humans", "Mental Disorders", "Pandemics", "Pneumonia, Viral", "Research"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083526023", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"7201667080": {"Name": "Holmes E.A.", "AuthorID": "7201667080", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet"}, "7202869264": {"Name": "O'Connor R.C.", "AuthorID": "7202869264", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Suicidal Behaviour Research Laboratory, Institute of Health and Wellbeing, University of Glasgow"}, "7101787946": {"Name": "Perry V.H.", "AuthorID": "7101787946", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute, University College London"}, "7004779970": {"Name": "Michie S.", "AuthorID": "7004779970", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Behaviour Change, University College London"}, "7003543961": {"Name": "Shafran R.", "AuthorID": "7003543961", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57191026623": {"Name": "Tracey I.", "AuthorID": "57191026623", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "15726198300": {"Name": "Przybylski A.K.", "AuthorID": "15726198300", "AffiliationID": "60175816, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford"}, "7102849907": {"Name": "Wessely S.", "AuthorID": "7102849907", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "55929284200": {"Name": "Arseneault L.", "AuthorID": "55929284200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "35394365500": {"Name": "Everall I.", "AuthorID": "35394365500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7006045579": {"Name": "Hotopf M.", "AuthorID": "7006045579", "AffiliationID": "60028884, 60171762", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at the Maudsley, Maudsley Hospital"}, "35351371500": {"Name": "Ballard C.", "AuthorID": "35351371500", "AffiliationID": "60111707, 60026479", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School, University of Exeter"}, "7401664450": {"Name": "Christensen H.", "AuthorID": "7401664450", "AffiliationID": "60104962", "AffiliationName": "Black Dog Institute"}, "57216436124": {"Name": "Cohen Silver R.", "AuthorID": "57216436124", "AffiliationID": "60007278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Science, Department of Medicine, Program in Public Health, University of California"}, "57212942850": {"Name": "Ford T.", "AuthorID": "57212942850", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge"}, "57216170859": {"Name": "Bullmore E.", "AuthorID": "57216170859", "AffiliationID": "60005210", "AffiliationName": "Department of Research and Development, Cambridgeshire & Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7102501082": {"Name": "John A.", "AuthorID": "7102501082", "AffiliationID": "60170471, 60004572", "AffiliationName": "Swansea University Medical School, Swansea University"}, "8306023400": {"Name": "Kabir T.", "AuthorID": "8306023400", "AffiliationID": "60117587", "AffiliationName": "The McPin Foundation"}, "57216438189": {"Name": "King K.", "AuthorID": "57216438189", "AffiliationID": "119936319", "AffiliationName": "Independent"}, "18634566400": {"Name": "Madan I.", "AuthorID": "18634566400", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Occupational Health, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"}, "26322114000": {"Name": "Sweeney A.", "AuthorID": "26322114000", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Research Institute, St George's University of London"}, "6701727124": {"Name": "Worthman C.M.", "AuthorID": "6701727124", "AffiliationID": "60000928", "AffiliationName": "Anthropology Faculty, Emory University"}, "7005996141": {"Name": "Yardley L.", "AuthorID": "7005996141", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychological Science, University of Bristol"}, "55521195000": {"Name": "Cowan K.", "AuthorID": "55521195000", "AffiliationID": "120821246", "AffiliationName": "Katherine Cowan Consulting Ltd"}, "57216439963": {"Name": "Cope C.", "AuthorID": "57216439963", "AffiliationID": "114162877", "AffiliationName": "Academy of Medical Sciences"}}}
