Cosmic reionization quenches star formation in all our simulated dwarfs, but three galaxies with final dynamical masses of 3 \u00d7 10#SUP#9#/SUP#MQ are subsequently able to replenish their interstellar medium by slowly accreting gas. Two of these galaxies reignite and sustain star formation until the present day at an average rate of 10-5 MQ yr-1, highly reminiscent of observed low-mass star-forming dwarf irregulars such as Leo T. The resumption of star formation is delayed by several billion years due to residual feedback from stellar winds and Type Ia supernovae; even at z = 0, the third galaxy remains in a temporary equilibrium with a large gas content but without any ongoing star formation. Using the 'genetic modification' approach, we create an alternative mass growth history for this gas-rich quiescent dwarf and show how a small (0.2 dex) increase in dynamical mass can overcome residual stellar feedback, reigniting star formation. The interaction between feedback and mass build-up produces a diversity in the stellar ages and gas content of low-mass dwarfs, which will be probed by combining next-generation HI and imaging surveys.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dark matter", "Galaxies: dwarf", "Galaxies: evolution", "Galaxies: formation", "Galaxies: haloes", "Methods: numerical"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095409773", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57201774045": {"Name": "Rey M.P.", "AuthorID": "57201774045", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "16030470600": {"Name": "Agertz O.", "AuthorID": "16030470600", "AffiliationID": "60007271, 60029170, 60118588", "AffiliationName": "Lund Observatory, Department of Astronomy and Theoretical Physics, Lund University, Box 43"}, "22036053000": {"Name": "Pontzen A.", "AuthorID": "22036053000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57213604274": {"Name": "Orkney M.D.A.", "AuthorID": "57213604274", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Surrey"}, "7202392051": {"Name": "Read J.I.", "AuthorID": "7202392051", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Surrey"}, "55184906800": {"Name": "Rosdahl J.", "AuthorID": "55184906800", "AffiliationID": "60023578, 60008134, 60012105", "AffiliationName": "Cnrs, Centre de Recherche Astrophysique de Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Ens de Lyon, UMR5574"}}}
