Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in urban and rural areas in Chongqing, Henan and Zhejiang provinces in 2018. A self-completion questionnaire was completed by students in the classroom setting. Results: There were 3774 completed questionnaires: the mean age of respondents was 13.58 (SD 0.87). For traditional bullying, 1332 (35.6%) identified as victims, and 341 (9.5%) as perpetrators. For cyberbullying, 1170 (31.4%) identified as victims, and 622 (16.6%) as perpetrators. After controlling for confounders, risks for traditional victimization were being male, attending boarding school, low academic performance, and a poor relationship with parents. Traditional perpetrators were more likely to be male, and have a poor relationship with parents. Risks for being a victim or perpetrator of cyberbullying were the same: male sex, attending boarding school, and having a poor relationship with parents. Compared to non-victims, traditional victims and cyber victims were at least 1.5 times more likely to report headache and sleep problems; traditional victims were 1.3 times more likely, and cyber victims 1.4 times more likely to report abdominal pain. Conclusions: Schools must take measures to raise awareness of bullying, to identify bullies and victims, and especially to protect the most vulnerable adolescents.", "AuthorKeywords": ["China", "Cyberbullying", "Psychosomatic", "Risk factor", "Traditional-bullying"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074031006", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"57211463843": {"Name": "Li J.", "AuthorID": "57211463843", "AffiliationID": "60029310", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Global Health, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"}, "57211452102": {"Name": "Sidibe A.", "AuthorID": "57211452102", "AffiliationID": "60029310", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Global Health, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"}, "57211459035": {"Name": "Shen X.", "AuthorID": "57211459035", "AffiliationID": "60029310", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Global Health, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"}, "7004268956": {"Name": "Hesketh T.", "AuthorID": "7004268956", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Institute for Global Health, UCL"}}}
