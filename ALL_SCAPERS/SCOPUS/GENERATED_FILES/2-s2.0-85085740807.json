Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine.Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and the heart failure (HF) that often result remain the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. As such, new therapeutic targets need to be discovered to protect the myocardium against acute ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in order to reduce myocardial infarct (MI) size, preserve left ventricular function and prevent the onset of HF. Mitochondrial dysfunction during acute I/R injury is a critical determinant of cell death following AMI, and therefore, ion channels in the inner mitochondrial membrane, which are known to influence cell death and survival, provide potential therapeutic targets for cardioprotection. In this article, we review the role of mitochondrial ion channels, which are known to modulate susceptibility to acute myocardial I/R injury, and we explore their potential roles as therapeutic targets for reducing MI size and preventing HF following AMI.", "AuthorKeywords": ["acute ischaemia/reperfusion injury", "cardioprotection", "Mitochondria", "mitochondrial permeability transition pore"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085740807", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"6602976997": {"Name": "Hausenloy D.J.", "AuthorID": "6602976997", "AffiliationID": "60072429", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Research Center, College of Medical and Health Sciences, Asia University"}, "7402392670": {"Name": "Schulz R.", "AuthorID": "7402392670", "AffiliationID": "60017134", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physiology, Justus-Liebig University Giessen"}, "6602311580": {"Name": "Girao H.", "AuthorID": "6602311580", "AffiliationID": "124378747", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Academic Centre of Coimbra, CACC"}, "7005846261": {"Name": "Kwak B.R.", "AuthorID": "7005846261", "AffiliationID": "60004718, 60026405", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Immunology, University of Geneva"}, "23472903200": {"Name": "De Stefani D.", "AuthorID": "23472903200", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Padova"}, "7005289262": {"Name": "Rizzuto R.", "AuthorID": "7005289262", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Padova"}, "7102271571": {"Name": "Bernardi P.", "AuthorID": "7102271571", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "CNR Neuroscience Institute"}, "26640371000": {"Name": "Di Lisa F.", "AuthorID": "26640371000", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "CNR Neuroscience Institute"}}}
