The nature of metabolism in \u03b1ICs and its relationship to transport was not well-understood. Here, using multiphoton live cell imaging in mouse kidney tissue, FIB-SEM, and other complementary techniques, we provide new insights into mitochondrial structure and function in \u03b1ICs. We show that \u03b1IC mitochondria have a rounded structure and are not located in close proximity to V-ATPase containing vesicles. They display a bright NAD(P)H fluorescence signal and low uptake of voltage-dependent dyes, but are energized by a pH gradient. However, expression of complex V (ATP synthase) is relatively low in \u03b1ICs, even when stimulated by metabolic acidosis. In contrast, anaerobic glycolytic capacity is surprisingly high, and sufficient to maintain intracellular calcium homeostasis in the presence of complete aerobic inhibition. Moreover, glycolysis is essential for V-ATPase-mediated proton pumping. Key findings were replicated in narrow/clear cells in the epididymis, also part of the MRC family. In summary, using a range of cutting-edge techniques to investigate \u03b1IC metabolism in situ, we have discovered that these mitochondria dense cells have a high glycolytic capacity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["calcium", "epididymis", "mitochondria", "multiphoton microscopy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adenosine Triphosphatases", "Animals", "Calcium", "Epididymis", "Epithelial Cells", "Glycolysis", "Homeostasis", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration", "Kidney Tubules, Collecting", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mitochondria", "Proton Pumps", "Proton-Translocating ATPases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085100349", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"57204505915": {"Name": "Ghazi S.", "AuthorID": "57204505915", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Anatomy, University of Zurich"}, "56056725800": {"Name": "Bugarski M.", "AuthorID": "56056725800", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Anatomy, University of Zurich"}, "35725524700": {"Name": "Haenni D.", "AuthorID": "35725524700", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Center for Microscopy and Image Analysis, University of Zurich"}, "55226515700": {"Name": "Hall A.M.", "AuthorID": "55226515700", "AffiliationID": "60019619", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, University Hospital Zurich"}, "35073740200": {"Name": "Craigie E.", "AuthorID": "35073740200", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Anatomy, University of Zurich"}, "7005653686": {"Name": "Bourgeois S.", "AuthorID": "7005653686", "AffiliationID": "60012614, 60019619", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physiology, University of Zurich"}, "7402148810": {"Name": "Wagner C.A.", "AuthorID": "7402148810", "AffiliationID": "60012614, 60019619", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physiology, University of Zurich"}, "57195131094": {"Name": "Gomariz A.", "AuthorID": "57195131094", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Computer Vision Laboratory, ETH Zurich"}, "8700255000": {"Name": "Nombela-Arrieta C.", "AuthorID": "8700255000", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, University of Zurich"}, "24173669800": {"Name": "Martins J.R.", "AuthorID": "24173669800", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Center for Microscopy and Image Analysis, University of Zurich"}, "8234615900": {"Name": "Unwin R.J.", "AuthorID": "8234615900", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "AstraZeneca Biopharmaceuticals R&D"}}}
