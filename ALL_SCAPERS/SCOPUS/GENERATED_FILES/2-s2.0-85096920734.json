This latest outburst was followed in detail by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, from less than a day after the eruption until the nova entered the Sun observing constraint, with a small number of additional observations after the constraint ended. The X-ray light curve shows initial hard shock emission, followed by an early start of the supersoft source phase around day 8.5, with the soft emission ceasing by day 26. Together with the peak blackbody temperature of the supersoft spectrum being \u223c100 eV, these timings suggest the white dwarf mass to be high, \u223c 1.3, M\u00b7. The UV photometric light curve decays monotonically, with the decay rate changing a number of times, approximately simultaneously with variations in the X-ray emission. The UV grism spectra show both line and continuum emission, with emission lines of N, C, Mg, and O being notable. These UV spectra are best dereddened using a Small Magellanic Cloud extinction law. Optical spectra from SMARTS show evidence of interaction between the nova ejecta and wind from the donor star, as well as the extended atmosphere of the red giant being flash-ionized by the supersoft X-ray photons. Data from NICER reveal a transient 83 s quasi-periodic oscillation, with a modulation amplitude of 5 per cent, adding to the sample of novae that show such short variabilities during their supersoft phase.", "AuthorKeywords": ["novae, cataclysmic variables", "stars: individual: V3890 Sgr", "X-rays: stars"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096920734", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"10239471100": {"Name": "Page K.L.", "AuthorID": "10239471100", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "X-Ray and Observational Astronomy Group, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester"}, "10241016700": {"Name": "Beardmore A.P.", "AuthorID": "10241016700", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "X-Ray and Observational Astronomy Group, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester"}, "12809549000": {"Name": "Osborne J.P.", "AuthorID": "12809549000", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "X-Ray and Observational Astronomy Group, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester"}, "6504237637": {"Name": "Kuin N.P.M.", "AuthorID": "6504237637", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "25226237000": {"Name": "Walter F.M.", "AuthorID": "25226237000", "AffiliationID": "60026415", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Stony Brook University"}, "7004101472": {"Name": "Markwardt C.B.", "AuthorID": "7004101472", "AffiliationID": "60006337", "AffiliationName": "Astrophysics Science Division, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center"}, "8341830900": {"Name": "Ness J.U.", "AuthorID": "8341830900", "AffiliationID": "60068629", "AffiliationName": "European Space Astronomy Centre"}, "7004591501": {"Name": "Orio M.", "AuthorID": "7004591501", "AffiliationID": "60032179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy, University of Wisconsin"}, "25644982200": {"Name": "Sokolovsky K.V.", "AuthorID": "25644982200", "AffiliationID": "60007457", "AffiliationName": "Sternberg Astronomical Institute, Moscow State University"}}}
