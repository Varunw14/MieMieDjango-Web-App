Treatment of [H2Os3(CO)10] with excess 2-ethynylpyridine affords [HOs3(CO)10(\u03bc-C5H4NCH=CH)] (1), [HOs3(CO)9(\u03bc3-C5H4NCCH2)] (2), [HOs3(CO)9(\u03bc3-C5H4NCCCO2)] (3), and [HOs3(CO)10(\u03bc-CHCHC5H4N)] (4) formed through either the direct addition of the Os-H bond across the CC bond or acetylenic C-H bond activation of the 2-ethynylpyridine substrate. In contrast, the dominant pathway for the reaction between [Ru3(CO)12] and 2-ethynylpyridine is C-C bond coupling of the alkyne moiety to furnish the triruthenium clusters [Ru3(CO)7(\u03bc-CO){\u03bc3-C5H4NCCHC(C5H4N)CH}] (5) and [Ru3(CO)7(\u03bc-CO){\u03bc3-C5H4NCCHC(C5H4N)CHCHC(C5H4N)}] (6). Cluster 5 contains a metalated 2-pyridyl-substituted diene while 6 exhibits a metalated 2-pyridyl-substituted triene moiety. The functionalized pyridyl ligands in 5 and 6 derive via the formal C-C bond coupling of two and three 2-ethynylpyridine molecules, respectively, and 5 and 6 provide evidence for facile alkyne insertion at ruthenium clusters. The solid-state structures of 1-3, 5, and 6 have been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses, and the bonding in the product clusters has been investigated by DFT. In the case of 1, the computational results reveal a rare thermodynamic preference for a terminal hydride ligand as opposed to a hydride-bridged Os-Os bond (3c,2e Os-Os-H bond).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["CH-bond activation", "Computational results", "Dominant pathways", "Ruthenium clusters", "Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis", "Solid-state structures", "Trimetallic clusters", "Triruthenium clusters"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090341456", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"57210281915": {"Name": "Joy M.T.R.", "AuthorID": "57210281915", "AffiliationID": "60029276", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Jahangirnagar University Savar"}, "57217881127": {"Name": "Roknuzzaman", "AuthorID": "57217881127", "AffiliationID": "60029276", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Jahangirnagar University Savar"}, "57221034503": {"Name": "Hossain M.E.", "AuthorID": "57221034503", "AffiliationID": "60029276", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Jahangirnagar University Savar"}, "24366466600": {"Name": "Ghosh S.", "AuthorID": "24366466600", "AffiliationID": "60029276", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Jahangirnagar University Savar"}, "7006918410": {"Name": "Kabir S.E.", "AuthorID": "7006918410", "AffiliationID": "60029276", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Jahangirnagar University Savar"}, "7005072839": {"Name": "Tocher D.A.", "AuthorID": "7005072839", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7103239169": {"Name": "Richmond M.G.", "AuthorID": "7103239169", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}}}
