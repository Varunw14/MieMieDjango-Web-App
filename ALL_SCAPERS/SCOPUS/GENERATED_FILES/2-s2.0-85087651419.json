This appealing question was first asked by Chv\u00e1tal and Koml\u00f3s in 1971, and has since attracted the attention of many researchers, inspiring a variety of related problems. The prevailing conjecture is that one can always find a monotone path of linear length, but until now the best known lower bound was n2/3-o(1). In this paper we almost close this gap, proving that any edge-ordering of the complete graph contains a monotone path of length n1-o(1).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087651419", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"]], "AuthorData": {"57195280517": {"Name": "Buci\u0107 M.", "AuthorID": "57195280517", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "35553760600": {"Name": "Sudakov B.", "AuthorID": "35553760600", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "57191668153": {"Name": "Wagner A.Z.", "AuthorID": "57191668153", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "56970784500": {"Name": "Kwan M.", "AuthorID": "56970784500", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Stanford University"}, "37087562400": {"Name": "Pokrovskiy A.", "AuthorID": "37087562400", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, Mathematics, and Statistics, Birkbeck University of London"}, "56288825100": {"Name": "Tran T.", "AuthorID": "56288825100", "AffiliationID": "60071354", "AffiliationName": "School of Applied Mathematics and Informatics, Hanoi University of Science and Technology"}}}
