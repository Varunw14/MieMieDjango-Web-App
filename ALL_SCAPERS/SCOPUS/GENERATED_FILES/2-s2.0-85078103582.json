Although construction industry actors will be crucial in realising these targets, their response to them is currently under-explored. Augmenting research on how middle actors shape energy consumption, this paper examines how everyday talk in the construction industry sustains this mismatch, drawing on a study of a hospital construction project with targets for energy in use. It applies Gilbert and Mulkay's approach to discourse analysis, particularly their interest in \u201caccounting for error\u201d, to data drawn from interviews with actors across the construction project, observation of daily life on site, and an examination of written interactions. Findings show how actors make a discursive division between the \u201ctheory\u201d and \u201creality\u201d of energy use. Expressing scepticism about \u201ctheory\u201d, in particular, allows them to rationalise problems with future operational energy consumption and thereby mitigate their professional liability. This division therefore perpetuates, rather than overcomes, the separation between energy in design and operation, displacing a more collaborative discussion of performance expectations. This challenges the assumption that targets for energy in use can be effective without accompanying changes in industry incentives and ways of working. This paper argues for more attention to the patterns of talk that are found in the construction industry, in order to uncover how this crucial set of actors will respond to new energy policy incentives.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Construction", "Discourse", "Energy performance gap", "Energy performance targets", "Middle actors", "Non-domestic buildings"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078103582", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Nuclear Energy and Engineering", "ENER", "2104"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"]], "AuthorData": {"36926852600": {"Name": "Willan C.", "AuthorID": "36926852600", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute, University College London"}, "6507276018": {"Name": "Ruyssevelt P.", "AuthorID": "6507276018", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute, University College London"}, "35728985200": {"Name": "Shipworth M.", "AuthorID": "35728985200", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute, University College London"}, "57205914586": {"Name": "Hitchings R.", "AuthorID": "57205914586", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}}}
