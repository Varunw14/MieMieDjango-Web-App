The work is made available under the Creative Commons CC0 public domain dedication.Kinesin-8 proteins are microtubule motors that are often involved in regulation of mitotic spindle length and chromosome alignment. They move towards the plus ends of spindle microtubules and regulate the dynamics of these ends due, at least in some species, to their microtubule depolymerization activity. Plasmodium spp. exhibit an atypical endomitotic cell division in which chromosome condensation and spindle dynamics in the different proliferative stages are not well understood. Genome-wide shared orthology analysis of Plasmodium spp. revealed the presence of two kinesin-8 motor proteins, kinesin-8X and kinesin-8B. Here we studied the biochemical properties of kinesin-8X and its role in parasite proliferation. In vitro, kinesin-8X has motility and depolymerization activities like other kinesin-8 motors. To understand the role of Plasmodium kinesin-8X in cell division, we used fluorescence-tagging and live cell imaging to define its location, and gene targeting to analyse its function, during all proliferative stages of the rodent malaria parasite P. berghei life cycle. The results revealed a spatio-temporal involvement of kinesin-8X in spindle dynamics and an association with both mitotic and meiotic spindles and the putative microtubule organising centre (MTOC). Deletion of the kinesin-8X gene revealed a defect in oocyst development, confirmed by ultrastructural studies, suggesting that this protein is required for oocyst development and sporogony. Transcriptome analysis of \u0394kinesin-8X gametocytes revealed modulated expression of genes involved mainly in microtubule-based processes, chromosome organisation and the regulation of gene expression, supporting a role for kinesin-8X in cell division. Kinesin-8X is thus required for parasite proliferation within the mosquito and for transmission to the vertebrate host.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Chromosome Segregation", "Female", "Kinesin", "Malaria", "Male", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Microtubules", "Mitosis", "Oocysts", "Plasmodium", "Protozoan Proteins", "Spindle Apparatus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073118273", "SubjectAreas": [["Parasitology", "IMMU", "2405"], ["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"57202607183": {"Name": "Zeeshan M.", "AuthorID": "57202607183", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60030816", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Sciences, Queens Medical Centre, University of Nottingham"}, "57198886592": {"Name": "Rea E.", "AuthorID": "57198886592", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60030816", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Sciences, Queens Medical Centre, University of Nottingham"}, "57210646593": {"Name": "Daniel E.", "AuthorID": "57210646593", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60030816", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Sciences, Queens Medical Centre, University of Nottingham"}, "36759626100": {"Name": "Brady D.", "AuthorID": "36759626100", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60030816", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Sciences, Queens Medical Centre, University of Nottingham"}, "8343732400": {"Name": "Tewari R.", "AuthorID": "8343732400", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60030816", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Sciences, Queens Medical Centre, University of Nottingham"}, "57211243824": {"Name": "Shilliday F.", "AuthorID": "57211243824", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Department of Biological Sciences, Birkbeck College"}, "57211238856": {"Name": "Liu T.", "AuthorID": "57211238856", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Department of Biological Sciences, Birkbeck College"}, "56283028900": {"Name": "Roberts A.J.", "AuthorID": "56283028900", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Department of Biological Sciences, Birkbeck College"}, "6701857441": {"Name": "Moores C.A.", "AuthorID": "6701857441", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Department of Biological Sciences, Birkbeck College"}, "57210636612": {"Name": "Abel S.", "AuthorID": "57210636612", "AffiliationID": "60029526", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular, Cell and Systems Biology, University of California Riverside"}, "57211240719": {"Name": "Williams D.", "AuthorID": "57211240719", "AffiliationID": "60029526", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular, Cell and Systems Biology, University of California Riverside"}, "35084986900": {"Name": "Le Roch K.G.", "AuthorID": "35084986900", "AffiliationID": "60029526", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular, Cell and Systems Biology, University of California Riverside"}, "55907485500": {"Name": "Mourier T.", "AuthorID": "55907485500", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "Biological Environmental Sciences and Engineering Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"}, "36957514800": {"Name": "Ferguson D.J.P.", "AuthorID": "36957514800", "AffiliationID": "60014564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological and Medical Sciences, Faculty of Health and Life Science, Oxford Brookes University"}, "57197152426": {"Name": "Stanway R.R.", "AuthorID": "57197152426", "AffiliationID": "60020486", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cell Biology, University of Bern"}, "37054494300": {"Name": "Roques M.", "AuthorID": "37054494300", "AffiliationID": "60020486", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cell Biology, University of Bern"}, "16215359300": {"Name": "Holder A.A.", "AuthorID": "16215359300", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Malaria Parasitology Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute"}, "7004341451": {"Name": "Pain A.", "AuthorID": "7004341451", "AffiliationID": "60014652", "AffiliationName": "Research Center for Zoonosis Control, Global Institution for Collaborative Research and Education (GI-CoRE), Hokkaido University"}}}
