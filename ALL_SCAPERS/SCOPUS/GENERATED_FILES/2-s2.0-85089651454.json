However, the link between powder layer thickness on pore formation and surface undulations in the LPBF parts remains unclear. In this paper, the influence of processing parameters on Ti-6Al-4 V additive manufactured thin-wall components are investigated for multilayer builds, using a custom-built process replicator and in situ high-speed synchrotron X-ray imaging. In addition to the formation of initial keyhole pores, the results reveal three pore phenomena in multilayer builds resulting from keyhole melting: (i) healing of the previous layers' pores via liquid filling during remelting; (ii) insufficient laser penetration depth to remelt and heal pores; and (iii) pores formed by keyholing which merge with existing pores, increasing the pore size. The results also show that the variation of powder layer thickness influences which pore formation mechanisms take place in multilayer builds. High-resolution microcomputed tomography images reveal that clusters of pores form at the ends of tracks, and variations in the layer thickness and melt flow cause irregular remelting and track height undulations. Extreme variations in height were found to lead to lack of fusion pores in the trough regions. It is hypothesised that the end of track pores were augmented by soluble gas which is partitioned into the melt pool and swept to track ends, supersaturating during end of track solidification and diffusing into pores increasing their size.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Additive manufacturing", "In situ X-ray imaging", "Laser powder bed fusion", "Porosity", "Ti-6Al-4V"], "IndexKeywords": ["High resolution", "Layer thickness", "Mechanical performance", "Microcomputed tomography", "Pore formation", "Processing parameters", "Surface undulation", "Synchrotron x rays"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089651454", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Engineering (miscellaneous)", "ENGI", "2201"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"57216839778": {"Name": "Sinclair L.", "AuthorID": "57216839778", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "57201552479": {"Name": "Leung C.L.A.", "AuthorID": "57201552479", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "57201556830": {"Name": "Marussi S.", "AuthorID": "57201556830", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "57188878779": {"Name": "Clark S.J.", "AuthorID": "57188878779", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "57193485571": {"Name": "Chen Y.", "AuthorID": "57193485571", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "8504683300": {"Name": "Lee P.D.", "AuthorID": "8504683300", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "55286895200": {"Name": "Olbinado M.P.", "AuthorID": "55286895200", "AffiliationID": "60032633", "AffiliationName": "ESRF - The European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, CS 40220"}, "23036850300": {"Name": "Rack A.", "AuthorID": "23036850300", "AffiliationID": "60032633", "AffiliationName": "ESRF - The European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, CS 40220"}, "57035167100": {"Name": "Gardy J.", "AuthorID": "57035167100", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical and Process Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "7202105773": {"Name": "Baxter G.J.", "AuthorID": "7202105773", "AffiliationID": "60003254", "AffiliationName": "Rolls-Royce plc"}}}
