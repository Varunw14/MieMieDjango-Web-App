This study aims to evaluate the impact of loss-of-function variants in AP-4 subunits on intracellular protein trafficking using patient-derived cells. We investigated 15 patient-derived fibroblast lines and generated six lines of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons covering a wide range of AP-4 variants. All patient-derived fibroblasts showed reduced levels of the AP4E1 subunit, a surrogate for levels of the AP-4 complex. The autophagy protein ATG9A accumulated in the trans-Golgi network and was depleted from peripheral compartments. Western blot analysis demonstrated a 3-5-fold increase in ATG9A expression in patient lines. ATG9A was redistributed upon re-expression of AP4B1 arguing that mistrafficking of ATG9A is AP-4-dependent. Examining the downstream effects of ATG9A mislocalization, we found that autophagic flux was intact in patient-derived fibroblasts both under nutrient-rich conditions and when autophagy is stimulated. Mitochondrial metabolism and intracellular iron content remained unchanged. In iPSC-derived cortical neurons from patients with AP4B1-associated SPG47, AP-4 subunit levels were reduced while ATG9A accumulated in the trans-Golgi network. Levels of the autophagy marker LC3-II were reduced, suggesting a neuron-specific alteration in autophagosome turnover. Neurite outgrowth and branching were reduced in AP-4-HSP neurons pointing to a role of AP-4-mediated protein trafficking in neuronal development. Collectively, our results establish ATG9A mislocalization as a key marker of AP-4 deficiency in patient-derived cells, including the first human neuron model of AP-4-HSP, which will aid diagnostic and therapeutic studies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptor Protein Complex 4", "Adaptor Protein Complex beta Subunits", "Adolescent", "Autophagosomes", "Autophagy", "Autophagy-Related Proteins", "Cell Line", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Fibroblasts", "Humans", "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Iron", "Loss of Function Mutation", "Male", "Membrane Proteins", "Microtubule-Associated Proteins", "Mitochondria", "Neurogenesis", "Neurons", "Protein Transport", "Spastic Paraplegia, Hereditary", "trans-Golgi Network", "Vesicular Transport Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079019119", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"57208188817": {"Name": "Behne R.", "AuthorID": "57208188817", "AffiliationID": "60032515", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Hospital W\u00fcrzburg"}, "57208187853": {"Name": "Teinert J.", "AuthorID": "57208187853", "AffiliationID": "60003280", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pediatric Neurology and Metabolic Medicine, Center for Child and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Heidelberg"}, "57208187070": {"Name": "Wimmer M.", "AuthorID": "57208187070", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60030521", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, F.M.
