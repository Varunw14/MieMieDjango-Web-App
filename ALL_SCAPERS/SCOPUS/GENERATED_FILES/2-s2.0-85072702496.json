The agents tested were: alpha-lactoalbumin (ALAC), a whey protein rich in tryptophan, effective in some animal models of epilepsy and on colon/intestine inflammation, valproic acid (VPA), an effective antiepileptic drug in this seizure model, mesalazine (MSZ) an effective aminosalicylate anti-inflammatory treatment against ulcerative colitis and sodium butyrate (NaB), a short chain fatty acid (SCFA) normally produced in the intestine by gut microbiota, important in maintaining gut health and reducing gut inflammation and oxidative stress. Intestinal inflammation was induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) administration for 6 days. Drug treatment was started on day 3 and lasted 11 days, when seizure susceptibility to PTZ was measured along with intestinal inflammatory markers (i.e. NF-\u03baB, I\u03ba-B\u03b1, COX-2, iNOS), histological damage, disease activity index (DAI) and SCFA concentration in stools. DSS-induced colitis increased seizure susceptibility and while all treatments were able to reduce intestinal inflammation, only ALAC and NaB exhibited significant antiepileptic properties in mice with induced colitis, while they were ineffective as antiepileptics at the same doses in control mice without colitis. Interestingly, in DSS-treated mice, VPA lost part of its antiepileptic efficacy in comparison to preventing seizures in non-DSS-treated mice while MSZ remained ineffective in both groups. Our study demonstrates that reducing intestinal inflammation through ALAC or NaB administration has specific anticonvulsant effects in PTZ-treated mice. Furthermore, it appears that intestinal inflammation may reduce the antiepileptic effects of VPA, although we confirm that it decreases seizure threshold in this group. Therefore, we suggest that intestinal inflammation may represent a valid antiepileptic target which should also be considered as a participating factor to seizure incidence in susceptible patients and also could be relevant in reducing standard antiepileptic drug efficacy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal", "Anticonvulsants", "Colitis", "Convulsants", "Dextran Sulfate", "Disease Models, Animal", "Epilepsy", "Male", "Mesalamine", "Mice", "Pentylenetetrazole", "Valproic Acid"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072702496", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56495147600": {"Name": "De Caro C.", "AuthorID": "56495147600", "AffiliationID": "60069616", "AffiliationName": "Chair of Pharmacology, Department of Health Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Catanzaro"}, "55761723200": {"Name": "Leo A.", "AuthorID": "55761723200", "AffiliationID": "60069616", "AffiliationName": "Chair of Pharmacology, Department of Health Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Catanzaro"}, "57208750679": {"Name": "Nesci V.", "AuthorID": "57208750679", "AffiliationID": "60069616", "AffiliationName": "Chair of Pharmacology, Department of Health Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Catanzaro"}, "13806486700": {"Name": "Citraro R.", "AuthorID": "13806486700", "AffiliationID": "60069616", "AffiliationName": "Chair of Pharmacology, Department of Health Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Catanzaro"}, "57201386594": {"Name": "De Sarro G.", "AuthorID": "57201386594", "AffiliationID": "60069616", "AffiliationName": "Chair of Pharmacology, Department of Health Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Catanzaro"}, "57200140760": {"Name": "Russo E.", "AuthorID": "57200140760", "AffiliationID": "60069616", "AffiliationName": "Chair of Pharmacology, Department of Health Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Catanzaro"}, "7006826423": {"Name": "Ghelardini C.", "AuthorID": "7006826423", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Psychology, Drug Research and Child Health-Neurofarba-Pharmacology and Toxicology Section, University of Florence"}, "7801513942": {"Name": "di Cesare Mannelli L.", "AuthorID": "7801513942", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Psychology, Drug Research and Child Health-Neurofarba-Pharmacology and Toxicology Section, University of Florence"}, "6701766775": {"Name": "Striano P.", "AuthorID": "6701766775", "AffiliationID": "60025153, 60016041", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Neurology and Muscular Diseases Unit, Department of Neurosciences, Rehabilitation, Ophthalmology, Genetics, Maternal and Child Health, University of Genoa, \u201cG.
