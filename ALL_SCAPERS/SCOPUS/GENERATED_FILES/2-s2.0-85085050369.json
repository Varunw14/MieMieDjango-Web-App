Although neuropsychiatric symptoms (eg, psychosis, depression, anxiety, behavioral problems) are frequently present, their prevalence and clinical predictors remain unknown. Objective: To determine the prevalence and predictors of neuropsychiatric symptoms in late-stage PD. Methods: We conducted a multinational study of patients with PD with \u22657 years disease duration and either a Hoehn and Yahr stage \u22654 or a Schwab and England score \u2264 50% in the on stage. Neuropsychiatric symptoms were assessed through interviews with carers using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, with a frequency \u00d7 severity score \u2265 4, indicating clinically relevant symptoms. The determinants analyzed were demographic characteristics, medication, and motor and nonmotor symptoms. Univariate and multivariate logistic analyses were performed on predictors of clinically relevant neuropsychiatric symptoms. Results: A total of 625 patients were recruited in whom the Neuropsychiatric Inventory could be completed. In 92.2% (576/625) of the patients, at least 1 neuropsychiatric symptom was present, and 75.5% (472/625) had \u22651 clinically relevant symptom. The most common clinically relevant symptoms were apathy (n = 242; 38.9%), depression (n = 213; 34.5%), and anxiety (n = 148; 23.8%). The multivariate analysis revealed unique sets of predictors for each symptom, particularly the presence of other neuropsychiatric features, cognitive impairment, daytime sleepiness. Conclusion: Neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in late-stage PD. The strongest predictors are the presence of other neuropsychiatric symptoms. Clinicians involved in the care for patients with late-stage PD should be aware of these symptoms in this specific disease group and proactively explore other psychiatric comorbidities once a neuropsychiatric symptom is recognized.", "AuthorKeywords": ["depression", "late-stage parkinsonism", "neuropsychiatric symptoms", "prevalence", "psychosis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085050369", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57191846742": {"Name": "Hommel A.L.A.J.", "AuthorID": "57191846742", "AffiliationID": "110116902", "AffiliationName": "Groenhuysen Organisation"}, "57216856617": {"Name": "Bloem PhD B.R.", "AuthorID": "57216856617", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Radboud University Medical Center, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Department of Neurology, Centre of Expertise for Parkinson & Movement Disorders"}, "57208387288": {"Name": "Meinders M.J.", "AuthorID": "57208387288", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Radboud University Medical Center, Radboud Institute for Health Sciences"}, "57207899673": {"Name": "Lorenzl S.", "AuthorID": "57207899673", "AffiliationID": "121573383", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nursing Science and Practice"}, "7006535087": {"Name": "Dodel R.", "AuthorID": "7006535087", "AffiliationID": "60007896", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geriatric Medicine, University Hospital Essen"}, "7101666975": {"Name": "Coelho M.", "AuthorID": "7101666975", "AffiliationID": "60021007", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences, Service of Neurology, Hospital Santa Maria"}, "57201370983": {"Name": "Ferreira J.J.", "AuthorID": "57201370983", "AffiliationID": "60021283, 60106051", "AffiliationName": "University of Lisbon, Lisbon School of Medicine (FMUL), Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Lisbon, Portugal; and University of Lisbon, Lisbon School of Medicine (FMUL), Instituto de Medicina Molecular"}, "55821968000": {"Name": "Laurens B.", "AuthorID": "55821968000", "AffiliationID": "60102125, 60106793", "AffiliationName": "Univ. de Bordeaux, Institut des Maladies Neurod\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ratives"}, "7003406799": {"Name": "Spampinato U.", "AuthorID": "7003406799", "AffiliationID": "60102125, 60106793", "AffiliationName": "Univ. de Bordeaux, Institut des Maladies Neurod\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ratives"}, "7102756596": {"Name": "Meissner W.", "AuthorID": "7102756596", "AffiliationID": "112787815", "AffiliationName": "New Zealand Brain Research Institute"}, "57192006912": {"Name": "Rosqvist K.", "AuthorID": "57192006912", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Department of Clinical Sciences, Lund University"}, "56830468600": {"Name": "Timpka J.", "AuthorID": "56830468600", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Department of Clinical Sciences, Lund University"}, "56259912900": {"Name": "Odin P.", "AuthorID": "56259912900", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Department of Clinical Sciences, Lund University"}, "6701612272": {"Name": "Wittenberg M.", "AuthorID": "6701612272", "AffiliationID": "60012556", "AffiliationName": "Coordinating Centre for Clinical Trials, Philipps University Marburg"}, "7005720642": {"Name": "Koopmans R.T.", "AuthorID": "7005720642", "AffiliationID": "100706761", "AffiliationName": "Joachim en Anna, Center for Specialized Geriatric Care"}, "55802371060": {"Name": "Schrag A.", "AuthorID": "55802371060", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
