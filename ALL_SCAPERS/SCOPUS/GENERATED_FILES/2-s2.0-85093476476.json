All rights reserved.Of major importance for the evaluation of the demand for emerging transportation systems is the data used. Given the evolution of data availability the last few years, the understanding of the data properties and their characteristics is of major importance. An overview of the data sources commonly used or lately emerging is presented, followed by a classification, based on the component of the transportation system that they represent, aiming at exploring the different benefits and shortcomings of them. A meta-analysis is also performed for the exploration of data quality aspects concerning transport-related datasets.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Data aspects", "Diverse data sources", "Emerging data", "Trasport survey"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85093476476", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)", "ECON", "2000"], ["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"]], "AuthorData": {"57060622700": {"Name": "Chaniotakis E.", "AuthorID": "57060622700", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Environment, Energy and Resources, University College London (UCL)"}, "55554420200": {"Name": "Efthymiou D.", "AuthorID": "55554420200", "AffiliationID": "60117650, 60019722", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Geo and Environmental Engineering, Technical University of Munich"}, "7004031914": {"Name": "Antoniou C.", "AuthorID": "7004031914", "AffiliationID": "60117650, 60019722", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Geo and Environmental Engineering, Technical University of Munich"}}}
