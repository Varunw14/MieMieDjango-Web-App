Aim To assess the effectiveness of a GP-targeted educational intervention to improve pain management in children with AOM. Design and setting Pragmatic, cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT). GPs in 37 practices (intervention n = 19; control n = 18) across the Netherlands recruited 224 children with GP-confirmed AOM and ear pain (intervention n = 94; control n = 130) between February 2015 and May 2018. Method GPs in practices allocated to the intervention group were trained (online and face-to-face) to discuss pain management with parents using an information leaflet, and prompted to prescribe weight-appropriate dosed paracetamol. Ibuprofen was additionally prescribed if pain control was still insufficient. GPs in the control group provided usual care. Results Mean ear pain scores over the first 3 days were similar between groups (4.66 versus 4.36; adjusted mean difference = -0.05; 95% confidence intervals [CI] = -0.93 to 0.83), whereas analgesic use, in particular ibuprofen, was higher in the intervention group. The total number of antibiotic prescriptions during the 28-day follow-up was similar (mean rate 0.43 versus 0.47; adjusted rate ratio [aRR] 0.97; 95% CI = 0.68 to 1.38). Parents of children in the intervention group were more likely to reconsult for AOM-related complaints (mean rate 0.70 versus 0.41; aRR 1.73; 95% CI = 1.14 to 2.62). Conclusion An intervention aimed at improving pain management for AOM increases analgesic use, particularly ibuprofen, but does not provide symptomatic benefit. GPs are advised to carefully weigh the potential benefits of ibuprofen against its possible harms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acute otitis media", "Child health", "Educational intervention", "Pain management", "Primary care"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092273460", "SubjectAreas": [["Family Practice", "MEDI", "2714"]], "AuthorData": {"57202829748": {"Name": "van Uum R.T.", "AuthorID": "57202829748", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "24345784200": {"Name": "Venekamp R.P.", "AuthorID": "24345784200", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "12764394100": {"Name": "Zuithoff N.P.A.", "AuthorID": "12764394100", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "54793507200": {"Name": "Sjoukes A.", "AuthorID": "54793507200", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "17342866400": {"Name": "van de Pol A.C.", "AuthorID": "17342866400", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "7004739501": {"Name": "Damoiseaux R.A.M.J.", "AuthorID": "7004739501", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "7007062761": {"Name": "Schilder A.G.M.", "AuthorID": "7007062761", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60011326", "AffiliationName": "Ear Institute, University College London Hospitals, Biomedical Research Centre"}}}
