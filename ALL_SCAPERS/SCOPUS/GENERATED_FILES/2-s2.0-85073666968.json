But far less understood are the processes governing in situ diversification on the world's mega islands, where large and isolated land masses produced morphologically distinct radiations from related taxa on continental regions. Madagascar has long been recognized as a natural laboratory due to its isolation, lack of influence from adjacent continents, and diversification of spectacular vertebrate radiations. However, only a handful of studies have examined rate shifts of in situ diversification for this island. Here, we examine rates of diversification in the Malagasy snakes of the family Pseudoxyrhophiinae (gemsnakes) to understand if rates of speciation were initially high, enhanced by diversification into distinct biomes, and associated with key dentition traits. Using a genomic sequence-capture data set for 366 samples, we determine that all previously described and newly discovered species are delimitable and therefore useful candidates for understanding diversification trajectories through time. Our analysis detected no shifts in diversification rate between clades or changes in biome or dentition type. Remarkably, we demonstrate that rates of diversification of the gemsnake radiation, which originated in Madagascar during the early Miocene, remained steady throughout the Neogene. However, we do detect a significant slowdown in diversification during the Pleistocene. We also comment on the apparent paradox where most living species originated in the Pleistocene, despite diversification rates being substantially higher during the earlier 15 myr.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gemsnakes", "in situ diversification", "island biogeography", "Neogene", "Pseudoxyrhophiinae", "speciation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073666968", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"6603392663": {"Name": "Burbrink F.", "AuthorID": "6603392663", "AffiliationID": "60011425", "AffiliationName": "Department of Herpetology, American Museum of Natural History"}, "57211372080": {"Name": "Kuhn A.", "AuthorID": "57211372080", "AffiliationID": "60032373, 60007033", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Graduate School and University Center, City University of New York"}, "6603781036": {"Name": "Raxworthy C.", "AuthorID": "6603781036", "AffiliationID": "60011425", "AffiliationName": "Department of Herpetology, American Museum of Natural History"}, "25951739400": {"Name": "Ruane S.", "AuthorID": "25951739400", "AffiliationID": "60000473", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, Rutgers University-Newark"}, "21739513500": {"Name": "Rabibisoa N.", "AuthorID": "21739513500", "AffiliationID": "60120571", "AffiliationName": "Mention Sciences de la Vie et de l'Environnement, Facult\u00e9 des Sciences de Technologies et de l'Environnement, Universit\u00e9 de Mahajanga, Campus Universitaire d'Ambondrona"}, "57190979972": {"Name": "Randriamahatantsoa B.", "AuthorID": "57190979972", "AffiliationID": "60120571", "AffiliationName": "Mention Sciences de la Vie et de l'Environnement, Facult\u00e9 des Sciences de Technologies et de l'Environnement, Universit\u00e9 de Mahajanga, Campus Universitaire d'Ambondrona"}, "14018290600": {"Name": "Raselimanana A.", "AuthorID": "14018290600", "AffiliationID": "60072617", "AffiliationName": "Mention: Zoologie et Biodiversit\u00e9 Animale, Facult\u00e9 des Sciences, Universit\u00e9 d'Antananarivo"}, "57211370819": {"Name": "Andrianarimalala M.", "AuthorID": "57211370819", "AffiliationID": "60072617", "AffiliationName": "Mention: Zoologie et Biodiversit\u00e9 Animale, Facult\u00e9 des Sciences, Universit\u00e9 d'Antananarivo"}, "6603144485": {"Name": "Cadle J.", "AuthorID": "6603144485", "AffiliationID": "113650294", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, East Georgia State College"}, "6602915362": {"Name": "Lemmon A.", "AuthorID": "6602915362", "AffiliationID": "60002092", "AffiliationName": "Department of Scientific Computing, Florida State University, Dirac Science Library"}, "18634940900": {"Name": "Lemmon E.", "AuthorID": "18634940900", "AffiliationID": "60002092", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Science, Florida State University"}, "7102608275": {"Name": "Nussbaum R.", "AuthorID": "7102608275", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Division of Reptiles and Amphibians Museum of Zoology, Research Museums Center, University of Michigan"}, "56865081700": {"Name": "Jones L.", "AuthorID": "56865081700", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Washington"}, "56724699300": {"Name": "Pearson R.", "AuthorID": "56724699300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research, Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}}}
