Differences could be due to a genetic predisposition to low intelligence and academic performance, factors arising due to the cleft phenotype (such as social stigmatization, impaired speech/language development) or confounding by the prenatal environment. A clearer understanding of this mechanism will inform interventions to improve educational attainment in individuals born with a cleft, which could substantially improve their quality of life. We assessed evidence for the hypothesis that common variant genetic liability to non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (nsCL/P) influences educational attainment. Methods: We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of nsCL/P with 1692 nsCL/P cases and 4259 parental and unrelated controls. Using GWAS summary statistics, we performed Linkage Disequilibrium (LD)-score regression to estimate the genetic correlation between nsCL/P, educational attainment (GWAS n = 766 345) and intelligence (GWAS n = 257 828). We used two-sample Mendelian randomization to evaluate the causal effects of genetic liability to nsCL/P on educational attainment and intelligence. Results: There was limited evidence for shared genetic aetiology or causal relationships between nsCL/P and educational attainment [genetic correlation (rg) -0.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.12 to 0.01, P 0.13; MR estimate (\u03b2MR) -0.002, 95% CI -0.009 to 0.006, P 0.679) or intelligence (rg -0.04, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.04, P 0.34; \u03b2MR -0.009, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.002, P 0.11). Conclusions: Common variants are unlikely to predispose individuals born with nsCL/P to low educational attainment or intelligence. This is an important first step towards understanding the aetiology of low educational attainment in this group.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cleft lip and palate", "Educational attainment", "Intelligence", "IQ", "Mendelian randomization", "Non-syndromic cleft", "Orofacial cleft"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088391329", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"]], "AuthorData": {"55621690400": {"Name": "Dardani C.", "AuthorID": "55621690400", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Academic Mental Health, Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "57194582090": {"Name": "Howe L.J.", "AuthorID": "57194582090", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "57210788953": {"Name": "Stergiakouli E.", "AuthorID": "57210788953", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "The Cleft Collective, University of Bristol"}, "6603403494": {"Name": "Relton C.L.", "AuthorID": "6603403494", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60172455, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "57220145221": {"Name": "Davey Smith G.", "AuthorID": "57220145221", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60172455, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "57198811524": {"Name": "Lewis S.J.", "AuthorID": "57198811524", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "The Cleft Collective, University of Bristol"}, "41561133300": {"Name": "Davies N.M.", "AuthorID": "41561133300", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60172455, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "56898577600": {"Name": "Sharp G.C.", "AuthorID": "56898577600", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "The Cleft Collective, University of Bristol"}, "8629123300": {"Name": "Mukhopadhyay N.", "AuthorID": "8629123300", "AffiliationID": "60015543", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Craniofacial and Dental Genetics, Department of Oral Biology, University of Pittsburgh"}, "7101675947": {"Name": "Weinberg S.M.", "AuthorID": "7101675947", "AffiliationID": "60015543", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Craniofacial and Dental Genetics, Department of Oral Biology, University of Pittsburgh"}, "7006257137": {"Name": "Marazita M.L.", "AuthorID": "7006257137", "AffiliationID": "60015543", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Craniofacial and Dental Genetics, Department of Oral Biology, University of Pittsburgh"}, "8921781500": {"Name": "Wren Y.", "AuthorID": "8921781500", "AffiliationID": "60027676", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Speech and Language Therapy Research Unit, North Bristol NHS Trust"}, "56601208100": {"Name": "Humphries K.", "AuthorID": "56601208100", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "The Cleft Collective, University of Bristol"}, "56601048700": {"Name": "Davies A.", "AuthorID": "56601048700", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "The Cleft Collective, University of Bristol"}, "55345294800": {"Name": "Ho K.", "AuthorID": "55345294800", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Bioresource Laboratories, Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "7102201954": {"Name": "Sandy J.", "AuthorID": "7102201954", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Dean of the Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "6701831972": {"Name": "Mangold E.", "AuthorID": "6701831972", "AffiliationID": "60030465, 60007493", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Human Genetics, University of Bonn"}, "35242679500": {"Name": "Ludwig K.U.", "AuthorID": "35242679500", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genomics, Life and Brain Center, University of Bonn"}}}
