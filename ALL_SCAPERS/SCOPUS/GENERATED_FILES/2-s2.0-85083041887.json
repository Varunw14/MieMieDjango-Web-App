The loss of C. elegans fzo-1MFN results in mitochondrial fragmentation, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and the induction of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt). We performed a genome-wide RNAi screen for genes that when knocked-down suppress fzo-1MFN(lf)-induced UPRmt. Of the 299 genes identified, 143 encode negative regulators of autophagy, many of which have previously not been implicated in this cellular quality control mechanism. We present evidence that increased autophagic flux suppresses fzo-1MFN(lf)-induced UPRmt by increasing mitochondrial membrane potential rather than restoring mitochondrial morphology. Furthermore, we demonstrate that increased autophagic flux also suppresses UPRmt induction in response to a block in mitochondrial fission, but not in response to the loss of spg-7AFG3L2, which encodes a mitochondrial metalloprotease. Finally, we found that blocking mitochondrial fusion or fission leads to increased levels of certain types of triacylglycerols and that this is at least partially reverted by the induction of autophagy. We propose that the breakdown of these triacylglycerols through autophagy leads to elevated metabolic activity, thereby increasing mitochondrial membrane potential and restoring mitochondrial and cellular homeostasis.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Autophagy", "Caenorhabditis elegans", "Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins", "Gene Expression Regulation", "GTP Phosphohydrolases", "Homeostasis", "Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial", "Mitochondria", "Mitochondrial Dynamics", "Mitochondrial Proteins", "RNA Interference", "Unfolded Protein Response"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083041887", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"57210292340": {"Name": "Haeussler S.", "AuthorID": "57210292340", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Biology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich"}, "56893231900": {"Name": "K\u00f6hler F.", "AuthorID": "56893231900", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Biology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich"}, "57216292611": {"Name": "Premm M.F.", "AuthorID": "57216292611", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Biology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich"}, "55298125600": {"Name": "Rolland S.G.", "AuthorID": "55298125600", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Biology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich"}, "57210292618": {"Name": "Fischer C.", "AuthorID": "57210292618", "AffiliationID": "60028717, 60075024", "AffiliationName": "Center for Integrated Protein Science, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich"}, "26642930200": {"Name": "Conradt B.", "AuthorID": "26642930200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "55578910900": {"Name": "Witting M.", "AuthorID": "55578910900", "AffiliationID": "60117644, 60019722", "AffiliationName": "Chair of Analytical Food Chemistry, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"}, "56488022000": {"Name": "Chauve L.", "AuthorID": "56488022000", "AffiliationID": "60000661", "AffiliationName": "Epigenetics Programme, Babraham Institute"}, "57190113793": {"Name": "Casanueva O.", "AuthorID": "57190113793", "AffiliationID": "60000661", "AffiliationName": "Epigenetics Programme, Babraham Institute"}}}
