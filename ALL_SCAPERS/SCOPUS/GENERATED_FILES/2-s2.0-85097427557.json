The extended FPV model is based on two mixture fractions considering the volatiles and char off-gases. The normalized total enthalpy is used for the interphase heat transfer modelling. Turbulence-chemistry interaction is treated with an assumed probability density function approach. The results show that the present LES can generally capture the flow field and particle distribution, while there are considerable deviations in the OH prediction due to the boundary treatment of using a mixture of volatiles and carrier gas to replace the methane-containing mixtures in the primary and pilot flow. It indicates that for such gas-assisted coal flames, the pilot fuel stream needs to be rigorously considered in the flamelet tabulation that could be resolved by extending the two-mixture-fraction model into a three-mixture-fraction model. The instantaneous Lagrangian particles histories show that the increasing of coal load has a negligible effect on devolatilization, but delays the char conversion.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cambridge coal flames", "Coal combustion", "FPV model", "Large Eddy Simulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomass conversion", "Boundary treatment", "Heat transfer modelling", "Lagrangian particles", "Measurement and simulation", "Mixture fraction models", "Particle distributions", "Turbulence-chemistry interactions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85097427557", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57193526093": {"Name": "Xing J.", "AuthorID": "57193526093", "AffiliationID": "60117972, 60003970", "AffiliationName": null}, "23393003000": {"Name": "Luo K.", "AuthorID": "23393003000", "AffiliationID": "60117972, 60003970", "AffiliationName": null}, "57216429726": {"Name": "Fan J.", "AuthorID": "57216429726", "AffiliationID": "60117972, 60003970", "AffiliationName": null}, "57218383514": {"Name": "Chen Y.", "AuthorID": "57218383514", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": null}, "15726474000": {"Name": "Stein O.T.", "AuthorID": "15726474000", "AffiliationID": "60015815", "AffiliationName": null}, "9736426700": {"Name": "Kronenburg A.", "AuthorID": "9736426700", "AffiliationID": "60015815", "AffiliationName": null}, "7102436109": {"Name": "Luo K.H.", "AuthorID": "7102436109", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": null}, "56379852500": {"Name": "Hasse C.", "AuthorID": "56379852500", "AffiliationID": "60011226", "AffiliationName": null}}}
