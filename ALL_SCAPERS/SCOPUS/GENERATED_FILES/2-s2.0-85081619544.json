Although multiple aspects of money and varied methodologies have been focused on and implemented, the underlying mechanisms of the empirical findings from these seemingly isolated areas significantly overlap. In this article, we operationalize money as a broad concept and take a novel approach by providing an integrated review of the literature and identifying five major streams of mechanisms: (a) self-focused behavior; (b) inhibited other-oriented behavior; (c) favoring of a self\u2013other distinction; (d) money\u2019s relationship with self-esteem and self-efficacy; and (e) goal pursuit, objectification, outcome maximization, and unethicality. Moreover, we propose a unified psychological perspective for the future\u2014money as an embodiment of social distinction\u2014which could potentially account for past findings and generate future work.", "AuthorKeywords": ["integrated review", "money", "psychological effects", "unified perspective"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081619544", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"57191165353": {"Name": "Wang X.", "AuthorID": "57191165353", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "The University of Hong Kong"}, "24723641900": {"Name": "Chen Z.", "AuthorID": "24723641900", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "The University of Hong Kong"}, "8280916700": {"Name": "Krumhuber E.G.", "AuthorID": "8280916700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
