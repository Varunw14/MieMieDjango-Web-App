Data collected in seven schools illustrate how teachers are responding to this advice and illuminate three tensions within \u2018controversial issues\u2019 pedagogy. First, we discuss the tension between depth and coverage in case studies, which risks treating history as parable. Second, we identify a problem with finding a genuinely open ethical dilemma to discuss, which entails the risk of adopting a hypocritical stance in the classroom. Third, we identify a tendency to perceive school as the antidote to undesirable social attitudes. The teachers\u2019 responses highlight the usefulness of framing certain issues as \u2018controversial\u2019 but also illustrate how difficult this can be in practice, especially in the context of CVE, which is perceived by many as a controversial policy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["citizenship education", "Controversial issues", "countering violent extremism", "pedagogy", "Prevent", "radicalisation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074014891", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"35751246500": {"Name": "Jerome L.", "AuthorID": "35751246500", "AffiliationID": "60014105", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, Middlesex University"}, "57193603792": {"Name": "Elwick A.", "AuthorID": "57193603792", "AffiliationID": "60014105", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, Middlesex University"}}}
