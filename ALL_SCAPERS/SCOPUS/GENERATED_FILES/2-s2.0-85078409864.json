All rights reserved.Research on technology-based learning and teaching has demonstrated evidence of its relevant role in music education. However, the application of technology to studio-based instrumental learning and teaching remains a relatively under-researched area. The article draws on findings from a recent exploratory study (HAMOND, 2017) which included fieldwork in Brazil. The aim of this study was to investigate the nature and potential pedagogical use of technology-mediated feedback in a higher education piano studio. Participants were one student-teacher dyad plus the researcher (the first author) with the dyad working on a memorised movement of a classical sonata of the student's current repertoire. The technology system involved a digital piano connected to a laptop computer running Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) software via Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) interface, and an additional computer screen. Three data sets were collected: videoed piano lessons (n = 2), semi-structured interviews with participants after each piano lesson (n = 4) and technology-generated MIDI data through the use of DAW software. Qualitative data analysis (QDA) involved a multi-methods approach. Research outcomes demonstrated how new digital technology can improve accessibility to aspects of advanced musical behaviour and learning that are often outside the individual's conscious awareness. The use of new digital technology can also optimise traditional pedagogical approaches in one-to-one piano studios, since it is likely to make the lesson foci clearer and the learning process more efficient.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Piano pedagogy", "Technology-based learning", "Visual feedback"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078409864", "SubjectAreas": [["Music", "ARTS", "1210"]], "AuthorData": {"57214232986": {"Name": "Hamond L.", "AuthorID": "57214232986", "AffiliationID": "108229082", "AffiliationName": "Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Apoio \u00c0 Escola T\u00e9cnica Do Rio de Janeiro"}, "7102907357": {"Name": "Welch G.", "AuthorID": "7102907357", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "15757410400": {"Name": "Himonides E.", "AuthorID": "15757410400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
