The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.Strong [O iii]\u03bb\u03bb4959,5007 + H\u03b2 emission appears to be typical in star-forming galaxies at z > 6.5. As likely contributors to cosmic reionization, these galaxies and the physical conditions within them are of great interest. At z > 6.5, where Ly\u03b1 is greatly attenuated by the intergalactic medium, rest-UV metal emission lines provide an alternative measure of redshift and constraints on the physical properties of star-forming regions and massive stars. We present the first statistical sample of rest-UV line measurements in z \u223c 2 galaxies selected as analogs of those in the reionization era based on [O iii]\u03bb\u03bb4959,5007 equivalent width (EW) or rest-frame U - B color. Our sample is drawn from the 3D-HST Survey and spans the redshift range 1.36 \u2264 z \u2264 2.49. We find that the median Ly\u03b1 and C iii]\u03bb\u03bb1907,1909 EWs of our sample are significantly greater than those of z \u223c 2 UV-continuum-selected star-forming galaxies. Measurements from both individual and composite spectra indicate a monotonic, positive correlation between C iii] and [O iii], while a lack of trend is observed between Ly\u03b1 and [O iii] at EW[O iii] \u2272 1000 \u00c5. At higher EW[O iii], extreme Ly\u03b1 emission starts to emerge. Using stacked spectra, we find that Ly\u03b1 and C iii] are significantly enhanced in galaxies with lower metallicity. Two objects in our sample appear comparable to z > 6.5 galaxies with exceptionally strong rest-UV metal line emission. These objects have significant C iv \u03bb\u03bb1548,1550, He ii \u03bb1640, and O iii]\u03bb\u03bb1661,1665 emission in addition to intense Ly\u03b1 or C iii]. Detailed characterization of these lower-redshift analogs provides unique insights into the physical conditions in z > 6.5 star-forming regions, motivating future observations of reionization-era analogs at lower redshifts.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081621895", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57191518124": {"Name": "Du X.", "AuthorID": "57191518124", "AffiliationID": "60029526", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of California, Riverside"}, "57203074321": {"Name": "Mobasher B.", "AuthorID": "57203074321", "AffiliationID": "60029526", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of California, Riverside"}, "6701830114": {"Name": "Shapley A.E.", "AuthorID": "6701830114", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of California, Los Angeles"}, "56541203100": {"Name": "Topping M.W.", "AuthorID": "56541203100", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of California, Los Angeles"}, "57189895474": {"Name": "Tang M.", "AuthorID": "57189895474", "AffiliationID": "60010065", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy, Steward Observatory, University of Arizona"}, "12242554300": {"Name": "Stark D.P.", "AuthorID": "12242554300", "AffiliationID": "60010065", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy, Steward Observatory, University of Arizona"}, "57203512946": {"Name": "Martin C.L.", "AuthorID": "57203512946", "AffiliationID": "60029241", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of California"}, "52263322100": {"Name": "Chevallard J.", "AuthorID": "52263322100", "AffiliationID": "116241480", "AffiliationName": "Scientific Support Office, Directorate of Science and Robotic Exploration, SA/ESTEC"}}}
