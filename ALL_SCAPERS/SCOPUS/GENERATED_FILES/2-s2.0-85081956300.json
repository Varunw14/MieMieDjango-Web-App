Most bones are, however, paradoxically curved. To solve this paradox, we used computed tomography-based, four-dimensional imaging methods and computational analysis to monitor acute and chronic whole-bone shape adaptation and remodeling in vivo. We first confirmed that some acute load-induced structural changes are reversible, adhere to the linear strain magnitude regulation of remodeling activities, and are restricted to bone regions in which marked antiresorptive actions are evident. We make the novel observation that loading exerts significant lasting modifications in tibial shape and mass across extensive bone regions, underpinned by (re)modeling independent of local strain magnitude, occurring at sites where the initial response to load is principally osteogenic. This is the first report to demonstrate that bone loading stimulates nonlinear remodeling responses to strain that culminate in greater curvature adjusted for load predictability without sacrificing strength.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Computational analysis", "Imaging method", "Linear strains", "Mechanical force", "Model independent", "Remodeling activity", "Shape adaptation", "Straight-shape", "Adaptation, Physiological", "Animals", "Bone and Bones", "Female", "Mice", "Osteogenesis", "Stress, Mechanical", "Weight-Bearing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081956300", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57215862308": {"Name": "Javaheri", "AuthorID": "57215862308", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Skeletal Biology Group, Comparative Biomedical Sciences, Royal Veterinary College"}, "36459508600": {"Name": "Gohin S.", "AuthorID": "36459508600", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Skeletal Biology Group, Comparative Biomedical Sciences, Royal Veterinary College"}, "57215812685": {"Name": "Wylie S.", "AuthorID": "57215812685", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Skeletal Biology Group, Comparative Biomedical Sciences, Royal Veterinary College"}, "57188648757": {"Name": "Chang Y.M.", "AuthorID": "57188648757", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Skeletal Biology Group, Comparative Biomedical Sciences, Royal Veterinary College"}, "57206490569": {"Name": "Pitsillides A.A.", "AuthorID": "57206490569", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Skeletal Biology Group, Comparative Biomedical Sciences, Royal Veterinary College"}, "55580172200": {"Name": "Razi H.", "AuthorID": "55580172200", "AffiliationID": "60000762", "AffiliationName": "Cluster of Excellence, Humboldt University of Berlin"}, "7101704469": {"Name": "Salmon P.", "AuthorID": "7101704469", "AffiliationID": "114996743", "AffiliationName": "Bruker MicroCT"}, "8504683300": {"Name": "Lee P.D.", "AuthorID": "8504683300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
