Common features in the structures are identified, with packing dominated by the co-ordination of the cationic head groups with bromide anions and interdigitation of the hydrocarbon chains. This arrangement provides an explanation for the thin adsorbed bilayers that have been observed at various hydrophilic surfaces from aqueous solutions in previous studies. The molecular volumes and arrangement are comparable with structures of a number of different self-assembled amphiphiles. For these surfactants with bromide counter-ions, formation of crystal hydrates was not observed. The alkyl chains are highly mobile and at high temperatures a plastic phase is found for all materials with a transition enthalpy that is similar to the melting enthalpy of many long alkyl chains. Other unexpected phase transitions depend more markedly on the hydrocarbon chain length and evidently depend on delicate balances of the various contributions to the free energy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bromide surfactants", "Homologous series", "Hydrocarbon chain length", "Hydrocarbon chains", "Hydrophilic surfaces", "Long alkyl chains", "Structure and dynamics", "Transition enthalpy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076061524", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"7005206877": {"Name": "Cockcroft J.K.", "AuthorID": "7005206877", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Christopher Ingold Laboratories, UCL"}, "57050255700": {"Name": "Shamsabadi A.", "AuthorID": "57050255700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Christopher Ingold Laboratories, UCL"}, "56130059200": {"Name": "Wu H.", "AuthorID": "56130059200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, UCL"}, "15121257200": {"Name": "Rennie A.R.", "AuthorID": "15121257200", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neutron Scattering, Uppsala University"}}}
