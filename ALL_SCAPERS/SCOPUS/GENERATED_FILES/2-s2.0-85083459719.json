The current study aimed to: (1) better understand how AN develops and persists in autistic individuals from the perspective of autistic women, parents and healthcare professionals; (2) derive a theoretical model of restrictive eating difficulties in autism. We conducted 44 semi-structured interviews and used Thematic Analysis to identify patterns of meaning across the data. Themes related to sensory sensitivities, social interaction and relationships, sense of self and identity, difficulties with emotions, thinking styles, and a need for control and predictability. We developed a model of potential autism-specific mechanisms underlying restrictive eating difficulties. This study generated novel insights, which have the potential to inform treatment adaptations following empirical testing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anorexia nervosa", "Autism", "Co-occurrence", "Eating disorders", "Females", "Qualitative research"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083459719", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"57193339910": {"Name": "Brede J.", "AuthorID": "57193339910", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "55747914900": {"Name": "Serpell L.", "AuthorID": "55747914900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "9743239400": {"Name": "Mandy W.", "AuthorID": "9743239400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "57216414188": {"Name": "Babb C.", "AuthorID": "57216414188", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Cardiff University"}, "55817552785": {"Name": "Jones C.", "AuthorID": "55817552785", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Cardiff University"}, "9741308000": {"Name": "Fox J.", "AuthorID": "9741308000", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Cardiff University"}, "57216409941": {"Name": "Elliott M.", "AuthorID": "57216409941", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "57217947821": {"Name": "Zanker C.", "AuthorID": "57217947821", "AffiliationID": "115613022", "AffiliationName": null}, "8384655900": {"Name": "Tchanturia K.", "AuthorID": "8384655900", "AffiliationID": "112885307", "AffiliationName": null}}}
