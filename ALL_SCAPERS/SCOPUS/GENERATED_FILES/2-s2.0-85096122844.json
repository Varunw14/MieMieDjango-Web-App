A body of research has cast doubt on the normative European representation of the multi-centre PUR as a balanced, sustainable spatial development model. Yet, the model has continued to be propagated in European territorial strategy and has been influential internationally. Academic perspectives and qualitative evidence reviewed in the paper shed a light on mutual dependencies and recursive relations between network economy global structural processes, international office real estate investment practices mediated by city governments, and the spatial configuration of density. Commercial investment and city planning actor practices chime with urban agglomeration, spatial concentration and density. Quantitative evidence of associations between urban density and office real estate investment returns and capital flows is found. It is concluded that network economy topology, politics and the city are in a dialectical relationship with the PUR territorial governance agenda for spatially balanced regional development.", "AuthorKeywords": ["actor practices", "polycentric urban region", "real estate", "spatial planning", "territorial governance", "topography", "topology", "urban density"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096122844", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"13905475000": {"Name": "Pain K.", "AuthorID": "13905475000", "AffiliationID": "60105822, 60012197", "AffiliationName": "Real Estate Planning, Henley Business School, University of Reading"}, "57205484225": {"Name": "Shi S.", "AuthorID": "57205484225", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Real Estate Construction, Faculty of Architecture, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"}, "57202122584": {"Name": "Black D.", "AuthorID": "57202122584", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "6602174383": {"Name": "Blower J.", "AuthorID": "6602174383", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Environmental Analytics, University of Reading"}, "57219922991": {"Name": "Grimmond S.", "AuthorID": "57219922991", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Meteorology, University of Reading"}, "55421836300": {"Name": "Hunt A.", "AuthorID": "55421836300", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University of Bath"}, "55655427100": {"Name": "Milcheva S.", "AuthorID": "55655427100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Planning, University College London"}, "7101748387": {"Name": "Crawford B.", "AuthorID": "7101748387", "AffiliationID": "60010307", "AffiliationName": "Geography and Environmental Sciences, University of Colorado"}, "56089657900": {"Name": "Dale N.", "AuthorID": "56089657900", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University of Bath"}, "57219926008": {"Name": "Doolin S.", "AuthorID": "57219926008", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Environmental Analytics, University of Reading"}, "57219929343": {"Name": "Manna S.", "AuthorID": "57219929343", "AffiliationID": "112618353", "AffiliationName": "Wokingham Borough Council, Wokingham"}}}
