Our predicted binding free energies, calculated using ESMACS, show a good correlation with previously reported experimental values of the ligands studied. Relative binding free energies, calculated using TIES, accurately predict experimentally determined values within a mean absolute error of approximately 1 kcal mol -1. Our methodology may be applied widely within the GPCR superfamily and to other small molecule-receptor protein systems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adenosine receptors", "binding affinity prediction", "ensemble simulations", "free energy", "G protein-coupled receptors", "molecular dynamics"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096502569", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"7202726029": {"Name": "Wan S.", "AuthorID": "7202726029", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Science, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57189005155": {"Name": "Husseini F.S.", "AuthorID": "57189005155", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Science, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56673346700": {"Name": "Wright D.W.", "AuthorID": "56673346700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Science, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7005747590": {"Name": "Coveney P.V.", "AuthorID": "7005747590", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "Computational Science Laboratory, Institute for Informatics, Faculty of Science, University of Amsterdam"}, "57189244904": {"Name": "Potterton A.", "AuthorID": "57189244904", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Research Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "7003508743": {"Name": "Heifetz A.", "AuthorID": "7003508743", "AffiliationID": "60102134", "AffiliationName": "Evotec (UK) Ltd"}, "6701753724": {"Name": "Townsend-Nicholson A.", "AuthorID": "6701753724", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Research Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "22433325400": {"Name": "Malawski M.", "AuthorID": "22433325400", "AffiliationID": "60023898, 60017351", "AffiliationName": "Ack Cyfronet, Agh University of Science and Technology"}}}
