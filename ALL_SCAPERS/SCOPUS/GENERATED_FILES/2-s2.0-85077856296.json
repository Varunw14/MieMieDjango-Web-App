M. de Barandiar\u00e1n from 1967 to 1974: a cranial vault fragment and seven teeth, five of which likely belonged to the same individual, although two are currently lost. Our goal is to describe in detail all these human remains and discuss both their taxonomic attribution and their stratigraphic context. Materials and methods: We describe external and internal anatomy, and use classic and geometric morphometrics. The teeth from Axlor are compared to Neandertals, Upper Paleolithic, and recent modern humans. Results: Two teeth (a left dm2, a left di1) and the parietal fragment show morphological features consistent with a Neandertal classification, and were found in an undisturbed Mousterian context. The remaining three teeth (plus the two lost ones), initially classified as Neandertals, show morphological features and a general size that are more compatible with their classification as modern humans. Discussion: A left parietal fragment (Level VIII) from a single probably adult Neandertal individual was recovered during the old excavations performed by Barandiar\u00e1n. Additionally, two different Neandertal children lost deciduous teeth during the formations of levels V (left di1) and IV (right dm2). In addition, a modern human individual is represented by five remains (two currently lost) from a complex stratigraphic setting. Some of the morphological features of these remains suggest that they may represent one of the scarce examples of Upper Paleolithic modern human remains in the northern Iberian Peninsula, which should be confirmed by direct dating.", "AuthorKeywords": ["enamel\u2013dentine junction", "geometric morphometrics", "Homo sapiens", "Neandertal", "Paleolithic"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Animals", "Anthropology, Physical", "Child", "Fossils", "History, Ancient", "Humans", "Neanderthals", "Skull", "Spain", "Tooth"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077856296", "SubjectAreas": [["Anatomy", "MEDI", "2702"], ["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"]], "AuthorData": {"16401627800": {"Name": "G\u00f3mez-Olivencia A.", "AuthorID": "16401627800", "AffiliationID": "60027282, 60001602", "AffiliationName": "Centro UCM-ISCIII de Investigaci\u00f3n sobre Evoluci\u00f3n y Comportamiento Humanos"}, "57170780600": {"Name": "Arlegi M.", "AuthorID": "57170780600", "AffiliationID": "60102125, 60106840", "AffiliationName": "PACEA UMR 5199, B\u00e2timent B8, All\u00e9e Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, Universit\u00e9 de Bordeaux"}, "23395808800": {"Name": "Arganda-Carreras I.", "AuthorID": "23395808800", "AffiliationID": "60017954", "AffiliationName": "Donostia International Physics Center (DIPC), Manuel Lardizabal Ibilbidea 4"}, "55206743000": {"Name": "Sala N.", "AuthorID": "55206743000", "AffiliationID": "60113906", "AffiliationName": "Centro Nacional de Investigaci\u00f3n sobre la Evoluci\u00f3n Humana (CENIEH)"}, "56211225900": {"Name": "Pantoja-P\u00e9rez A.", "AuthorID": "56211225900", "AffiliationID": "60027282, 60001602", "AffiliationName": "Centro UCM-ISCIII de Investigaci\u00f3n sobre Evoluci\u00f3n y Comportamiento Humanos"}, "56043740200": {"Name": "L\u00f3pez-Onaindia D.", "AuthorID": "56043740200", "AffiliationID": "60023020", "AffiliationName": "GREAB, Unitat d'Antropologia Biol\u00f2gica, Departament de Biologia Animal, Biologia Vegetal i Ecologia, Facutat de Bioci\u00e8ncies, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}, "54396064500": {"Name": "Rios-Garaizar J.", "AuthorID": "54396064500", "AffiliationID": "60113906", "AffiliationName": "Centro Nacional de Investigaci\u00f3n sobre la Evoluci\u00f3n Humana (CENIEH)"}, "8610802800": {"Name": "Balzeau A.", "AuthorID": "8610802800", "AffiliationID": "60068584", "AffiliationName": "Department of African Zoology, Royal Museum for Central Africa"}, "19638655200": {"Name": "G\u00f3mez-Robles A.", "AuthorID": "19638655200", "AffiliationID": "60025352", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, Natural History Museum"}}}
