In cases such as these, alternative methods of identification become vital. Three-dimensional reconstructions have increased the potential for utilizing qualitative and quantitative analysis of anatomical structures within forensic anthropology approaches. This paper presents a method to produce three-dimensional reconstructions of paranasal sinuses for biological analysis of skeletal remains. Previous published research has quantified the variability of the paranasal sinuses and has begun to explore their ability to provide biological information within forensic science contexts. However, the complex anatomical structure of the sinuses has led to significant limitations in the ability to produce three-dimensional reconstructions for analysis using an automatic approach. Therefore, this new method for developing three-dimensional models of the paranasal sinuses using an automatic approach that is suitable for a large sample size is timely. It offers a new pathway to more sophisticated methods of analysis that ultimately offer the potential to provide valid and robust distinctions between individuals and identifications in crime reconstructions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["forensic anthropology", "Forensic science", "paranasal sinuses", "segmentation", "three-dimensional modelling"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085975621", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"]], "AuthorData": {"57217060992": {"Name": "Robles M.", "AuthorID": "57217060992", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Archaeology"}, "57194780985": {"Name": "Morgan R.M.", "AuthorID": "57194780985", "AffiliationID": "60176024", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Security and Crime Science"}, "55020435400": {"Name": "Rando C.", "AuthorID": "55020435400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Archaeology"}}}
