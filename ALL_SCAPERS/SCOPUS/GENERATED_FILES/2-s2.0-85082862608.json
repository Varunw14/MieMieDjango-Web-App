Hypertension in the peripartum period may be due to the continuation of pre-existing or gestational hypertension, de novo development of pre-eclampsia or it may be also induced by some drugs used for analgesia or suppression of postpartum haemorrhage. Women with severe hypertension and hypertensive emergencies are at high risk of life-threatening complications, therefore, despite the lack of evidence-based data, based on expert opinion, antihypertensive treatment is recommended. Labetalol intravenously and methyldopa orally are then the two most frequently used drugs. Short-acting oral nifedipine is suggested to be used only if other drugs or iv access are not available. Induction of labour is associated with improved maternal outcome and should be advised for women with gestational hypertension or mild pre-eclampsia at 37 weeks' gestation. This position paper provides the first interdisciplinary approach to the management of hypertension in the peripartum period based on the best available evidence and expert consensus.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antihypertensive drugs", "Gestational hypertension", "Hypertensive emergency", "Low dose of acetylsalicylic acid", "Pre-eclampsia", "Pre-existing hypertension"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082862608", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"7004832017": {"Name": "C\u00edfkov\u00e1 R.", "AuthorID": "7004832017", "AffiliationID": "60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine II, Charles University in Prague, First Faculty of Medicine"}, "7406603972": {"Name": "Johnson M.R.", "AuthorID": "7406603972", "AffiliationID": "60175990, 60002484", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology, Imperial College School of Medicine, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital"}, "7005494859": {"Name": "Kahan T.", "AuthorID": "7005494859", "AffiliationID": "60026150, 60012311", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Clinical Sciences, Karolinska Institutet, Danderyd Hospital"}, "7801469734": {"Name": "Brguljan J.", "AuthorID": "7801469734", "AffiliationID": "60021479", "AffiliationName": "Division of Internal Medicine, Department of Hypertension, Medical Faculty, University Medical Centre Ljubljana"}, "57198065489": {"Name": "Williams B.", "AuthorID": "57198065489", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}, "56117742600": {"Name": "Coca A.", "AuthorID": "56117742600", "AffiliationID": "60001576, 60030315", "AffiliationName": "Hypertension and Vascular Risk Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona"}, "26023501200": {"Name": "Manolis A.", "AuthorID": "26023501200", "AffiliationID": "60069142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Asklepeion General Hospital"}, "6603493506": {"Name": "Thomopoulos C.", "AuthorID": "6603493506", "AffiliationID": "112631316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Helena Venizelou General and Maternal Hospital"}, "57202113920": {"Name": "Borghi C.", "AuthorID": "57202113920", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Bologna"}, "7004175719": {"Name": "Tsioufis C.", "AuthorID": "7004175719", "AffiliationID": "60028900, 60003720, 60067083", "AffiliationName": "First Cardiology Clinic, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Hippokration Hospital"}, "57216792295": {"Name": "Parati G.", "AuthorID": "57216792295", "AffiliationID": "60006646", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Unit, Department of Cardiovascular, Neural and Metabolic Sciences, Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS, S.Luca Hospital"}, "6602140497": {"Name": "Sudano I.", "AuthorID": "6602140497", "AffiliationID": "60012614, 60019619", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, University Heart Center Zurich, University Hospital and University of Zurich"}, "55815978400": {"Name": "Mcmanus R.J.", "AuthorID": "55815978400", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "6603660518": {"Name": "Van Den Born B.J.H.", "AuthorID": "6603660518", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Internal and Vascular Medicine, Department of Public Health, Amsterdam University Medical Centre"}, "7006921582": {"Name": "Regitz-Zagrosek V.", "AuthorID": "7006921582", "AffiliationID": "60026245, 60106629", "AffiliationName": "Berlin Institute for Gender in Medicine and CCR, Charit\u00e9 University Medicine Berlin, DZHK"}, "56883000000": {"Name": "De Simone G.", "AuthorID": "56883000000", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Advanced Biomedical Sciences, Hypertension Research Center, Federico II University"}}}
