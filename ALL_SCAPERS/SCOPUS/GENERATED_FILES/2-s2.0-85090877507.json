Multimorbidity is strongly associated with increasing age and is also directly linked to socioeconomic status. A substantial body of scientific evidence has shown an association between specific oral diseases and a range of other health conditions. Less is known, however, about the inter-relationships between oral diseases and multiple other health conditions. As multimorbidity is increasingly becoming the norm, rather than the exception, a profound shift is now needed in the training of oral health professionals, and the practice and delivery of dental care. A more integrated and coordinated approach to training and care is needed, which will require radical system-level reform and redesign of how health and dental services are commissioned, delivered and financed. Truly multidisciplinary teamwork requires system reform to facilitate effective joint working. The pattern of disease in society is changing and the dental profession needs to respond accordingly.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090877507", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"7102907522": {"Name": "Watt R.G.", "AuthorID": "7102907522", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, UCL, 1\u201319 Torrington Place, London"}, "57202210624": {"Name": "Serban S.", "AuthorID": "57202210624", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Dentistry, University of Leeds"}}}
