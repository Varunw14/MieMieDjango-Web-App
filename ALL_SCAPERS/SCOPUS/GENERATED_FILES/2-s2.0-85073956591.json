KGaA, WeinheimThe hazards and difficulties of handling elemental halogens such as I2 can be circumvented through the electrochemical generation of these species in situ and \u2018on-demand\u2019. Advantages of this approach include the halogen being introduced into the reaction mixture at a steady rate, ensuring low concentrations to prevent halogenation of reactive aromatic rings. We also demonstrate that the Lewis acid required to promote this reaction, a Zn(II) salt, can also be generated in situ from a zinc-coated graphite electrode in a clean and energy-efficient manner. Mechanistic studies indicate an unusual pathway, which provides selectivity for the iodocyclisation without the often-problematic electrophilic aromatic iodination of the aryl ring.", "AuthorKeywords": ["electrochemistry", "iodocyclisation", "mechanisms", "processes", "synthesis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electrochemical Generation", "Electrochemical process", "Elemental halogens", "Energy efficient", "iodocyclisation", "Low concentrations", "Mechanistic studies", "Reaction mixture"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073956591", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Electrochemistry", "CHEM", "1603"]], "AuthorData": {"57211434850": {"Name": "Li D.", "AuthorID": "57211434850", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57205058673": {"Name": "Seavill P.", "AuthorID": "57205058673", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003846767": {"Name": "Wilden J.", "AuthorID": "7003846767", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
