Many such high-redshift galaxies display a red [3.6]-[4.5] micron colour, often referred to as the 'IRAC excess', which has conventionally been interpreted as arising from intense [O iii]+H \u03b2 emission within the [4.5] micron bandpass. An appealing aspect of this interpretation is similarly intense line emission seen in star-forming galaxies at lower redshift as well as the redshift-dependent behaviour of the IRAC colours beyond z \u223c7 modelled as the various nebular lines move through the two bandpasses. In this paper, we demonstrate that, given the photometric uncertainties, established stellar populations with Balmer (4000 \u00c5 rest frame) breaks, such as those inferred at z > 9 where line emission does not contaminate the IRAC bands, can equally well explain the redshift-dependent behaviour of the IRAC colours in 7 \u2272 z \u2272 9 galaxies. We discuss possible ways of distinguishing between the two hypotheses using ALMA measures of [O iii] \u03bb88 micron and dust continuum fluxes. Prior to further studies with JWST, we show that the distinction is important in determining the assembly history of galaxies in the first 500 Myr.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cosmology: Dark ages, reionization, first stars", "cosmology: Early Universe", "galaxies: High-redshift", "Galaxy: Evolution"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094623921", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"56644982500": {"Name": "Roberts-Borsani G.W.", "AuthorID": "56644982500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7401985303": {"Name": "Ellis R.S.", "AuthorID": "7401985303", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "39961882400": {"Name": "Laporte N.", "AuthorID": "39961882400", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}}}
