Methods: Retrospective analysis of 124 patients treated with open PC-RPLND at two tertiary referral centers between 2001 and 2018. Perioperative morbidity was determined by analyzing additional surgical procedures, intra-operative blood loss, and postoperative complications. Results: An additional procedure was necessary for 33 patients (26.6%). The risk was higher in patients with IGCCCG intermediate/poor prognosis (OR 3.56; 95% CI 1.33\u20139.52) and residual tumor size > 5 cm (OR 3.53; 95% CI 1.39\u20138.93). Blood loss was higher in patients with IGCCCG intermediate/poor prognosis (\u03b2 = 0.177; p = 0.029), large residual tumor (\u03b2 = 0.570; p < 0.001), an additional intervention (\u03b2 = 0.342; p < 0.001) and teratoma on retroperitoneal histology (\u03b2 = \u2212 0.19; p = 0.014). Thirty-one patients had a postoperative complication Clavien-Dindo Grade \u2265 2 (25.0%). Complication risk was highest in patients undergoing an additional intervention (OR 3.46; 95% CI 1.03\u201311.60; p = 0.044). Conclusions: The rate of additional interventions in our series is comparable to what has been reported in high-volume centers. IGCCCG intermediate/poor prognosis patients with high-volume disease and patients undergoing an additional surgical procedure can be classified as high-risk patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Morbidity", "Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection", "Testicular cancer", "Testicular germ cell tumor"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085090017", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"57205185054": {"Name": "Blok J.M.", "AuthorID": "57205185054", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute"}, "16203334900": {"Name": "Meijer R.P.", "AuthorID": "16203334900", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncological Urology, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "55432632000": {"Name": "Bosch J.L.H.R.", "AuthorID": "55432632000", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncological Urology, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "7004230990": {"Name": "van der Poel H.G.", "AuthorID": "7004230990", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute"}, "7004237921": {"Name": "Bex A.", "AuthorID": "7004237921", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute"}, "8889252000": {"Name": "Horenblas S.", "AuthorID": "8889252000", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute"}, "55745168300": {"Name": "van Vooren J.", "AuthorID": "55745168300", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "57209100835": {"Name": "van Urk J.J.", "AuthorID": "57209100835", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute"}}}
