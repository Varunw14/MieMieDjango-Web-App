Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.This article investigates the remediating effect of bio-sensing technology on touch practices in the context of parent-infant interaction. We examine how the entry of a biosensing technology into the social, sensory and technological ecology of family homes interacts with the ways in which parents and babies know each other and communicate through touch. The paper centres on an exploratory case study of the Owlet Smart Sock (OSS), a bio-sensing baby monitoring device. We bring the social critical and experiential lenses of multimodality and sensory ethnography to studying the OSS as a socio-technological probe across a range of research encounters, including focus groups, home visits and video re-enactments with parents. In doing so, we provide an account of the ways in which the technology affects how babies and parents\u2019 bodies are (re)imagined, assessed, controlled, interrelated, experienced, and cared for and move beyond generic social debate around the quantified-objectified baby and fears of touch deprivation in contemporary digital culture.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bio-sensing", "Digital technologies", "multimodal communication", "sensory ethnography", "touch"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088878431", "SubjectAreas": [["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"], ["Library and Information Sciences", "SOCI", "3309"]], "AuthorData": {"54681987600": {"Name": "Leder Mackley K.", "AuthorID": "54681987600", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Culture Communication and Media, UCL Knowledge Lab"}, "15220569600": {"Name": "Jewitt C.", "AuthorID": "15220569600", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Culture Communication and Media, UCL Knowledge Lab"}, "16234800800": {"Name": "Price S.", "AuthorID": "16234800800", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Culture Communication and Media, UCL Knowledge Lab"}}}
