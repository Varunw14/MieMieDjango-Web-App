We explore this in the corporate social responsibility (CSR) context where online CSR dialogs form as brands interact with consumers using social media. Study 1 examines eight brands' digital CSR communications on Twitter and suggests these dialogs are present but are rarely part of the process with most interactions between their consumers. Study 2 assesses the brands' CSR relevant tweets' content and finds that most are not relevant to CSR and, moreover, are predominantly one-way. Therefore, both studies reveal that brands are not tapping into the potential for co-creation that is inherent in social media. Thus, we recommend that social media communications should include (a) mentions of individual consumers, (b) audience specific and relevant message content, and (c) opportunities for consumers to co-create value with the relevant brands.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Broadcast media", "Consumer engagement", "Corporate social responsibility", "Online CSR dialog", "Social media", "Value co-creation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072189871", "SubjectAreas": [["Marketing", "BUSI", "1406"]], "AuthorData": {"7202222682": {"Name": "Okazaki S.", "AuthorID": "7202222682", "AffiliationID": "60177637, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's Business School, King's College London"}, "36867799800": {"Name": "Plangger K.", "AuthorID": "36867799800", "AffiliationID": "60177637, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's Business School, King's College London"}, "7401998314": {"Name": "West D.", "AuthorID": "7401998314", "AffiliationID": "60177637, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's Business School, King's College London"}, "42661760100": {"Name": "Men\u00e9ndez H.D.", "AuthorID": "42661760100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
