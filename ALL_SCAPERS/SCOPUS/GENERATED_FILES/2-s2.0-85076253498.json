This paper studies the safety-zone layout design of a floating power plant fueled by NG. Hazards from the unwanted release of liquefied NG (LNG) in bunkering or NG in operation always exist, and it is thus important to reduce the associated risk to an acceptable level. One engineering technique used to reduce this risk involves the design of a safety zone to prevent and minimize exposure to unwated release of LNG or NG that may occur during the bunkering process. Industry practices are available for the design of the layout of such safety-zones, but their applicability to floating power plants is uncertain, and a more intuitive approach is required. The objective of this study is to discuss the challenges of establishing safety zones on floating power plants by reviewing and comparing existing industrial practices and to propose a hybrid approach for the design of a safety-zone layout. The applicability of the proposed hybrid approach is discussed with an applied example.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Floating LNG-Fueled power plant", "Hybrid approach", "LNG bunkering", "Safety-zone layout design", "Unwanted release of LNG"], "IndexKeywords": ["Energy source", "Engineering techniques", "Hybrid approach", "Industrial practices", "Industry practices", "Layout designs", "Safety zone"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076253498", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"]], "AuthorData": {"55788466700": {"Name": "Park S.I.", "AuthorID": "55788466700", "AffiliationID": "123298148", "AffiliationName": "Department of the System Safety Research, Energy Technology R&D Group, Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering Co., Ltd."}, "57212222507": {"Name": "Kim S.K.", "AuthorID": "57212222507", "AffiliationID": "121161595", "AffiliationName": "The Medium Ship Design Centre, The Korea Research Institute of Ship and Ocean Engineering"}, "57212222343": {"Name": "Paik FREng J.K.", "AuthorID": "57212222343", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
