The underbody shape (the region that makes contact with the liquid layer) is described by a smooth polynomic curve for which the magnitude of underbody thickness is represented by the scale parameter C. The body undergoes an oblique impact (where the horizontal speed of the body is much greater than its vertical speed) onto a liquid layer with the underbody\u2019s trailing edge making the initial contact. This downstream contact point of the wetted region is modelled as fixed (relative to the body) throughout the skimming motion with the liquid layer assumed to detach smoothly from this sharp trailing edge. There are two geometrical scenarios of interest: the concave case (C< 0 producing a hooked underbody) and the convex case (C> 0 producing a rounded underbody). As C is varied the rebound dynamics of the motion are predicted. Analyses of small-time water entry and of water exit are presented and are shown to be broadly in agreement with the computational results of the shallow-water model. Reduced analysis and physical insights are also presented in each case alongside numerical investigations and comparisons as C is varied, indicating qualitative analytical/numerical agreement. Increased body thickness substantially changes the interaction structure and accentuates inertial forces in the fluid flow.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aircraft icing", "Fluid\u2013body interactions", "Shallow water skimming"], "IndexKeywords": ["Computational results", "Inertial forces", "Interaction structures", "Numerical investigations", "Scale parameter", "Shallow liquid layer", "Shallow water layers", "Shallow water model"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090445367", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"57206198076": {"Name": "Palmer R.A.", "AuthorID": "57206198076", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics, University of Bristol"}, "57203583662": {"Name": "Smith F.T.", "AuthorID": "57203583662", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, UCL"}}}
