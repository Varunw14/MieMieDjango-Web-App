In order to be successful, a step-change is needed to not just simply halt biodiversity loss, but to bend the curve of biodiversity loss to stable or increasing species\u2019 populations. Here, we propose a framework that quantifies species\u2019 responses across gradients of threat intensity to implement more efficient and better targeted conservation actions. Our framework acknowledges the variation in threat intensities as well as the differences among species in their capacity to respond, and is implemented at a relevant scale for national and international policy-making.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anthropocene", "biodiversity", "biome", "biotic responses", "extinction", "threshold"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85097216161", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"]], "AuthorData": {"56457522000": {"Name": "Ingram D.J.", "AuthorID": "56457522000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research, University College London"}, "56304529300": {"Name": "Ferreira G.B.", "AuthorID": "56304529300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research, University College London"}, "7404728090": {"Name": "Jones K.E.", "AuthorID": "7404728090", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research, University College London"}, "7006595259": {"Name": "Mace G.M.", "AuthorID": "7006595259", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research, University College London"}}}
