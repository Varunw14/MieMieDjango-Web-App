This means that, also during this pandemic, fetal anomalies will be detected, and that discussions regarding invasive genetic testing and possibly fetal therapy will need to take place. For patients, concerns about Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus 2 will add to the anxiety caused by the diagnosis of a serious fetal anomaly. Yet, also for fetal medicine teams the situation gets more complex as they must weigh up the risks and benefits to the fetus as well as the mother, while managing a changing evidence base and logistic challenges in their healthcare system.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["COVID-19", "Disasters", "Female", "Fetal Therapies", "Humans", "Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical", "Pandemics", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications, Infectious"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083865603", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"55981137300": {"Name": "Deprest J.", "AuthorID": "55981137300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "6504090712": {"Name": "Lannoo L.", "AuthorID": "6504090712", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Development and Regeneration, Biomedical Sciences, KU Leuven"}, "37038341600": {"Name": "Richter J.", "AuthorID": "37038341600", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Development and Regeneration, Biomedical Sciences, KU Leuven"}, "57216556426": {"Name": "Bredaki E.", "AuthorID": "57216556426", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "7402605276": {"Name": "David A.", "AuthorID": "7402605276", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "7005113740": {"Name": "Van Ranst M.", "AuthorID": "7005113740", "AffiliationID": "60068577, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory Clinical and Epidemiologic Virology (Rega Institute), Department Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Biomedical Sciences, KU Leuven"}, "7201765102": {"Name": "Ryan G.", "AuthorID": "7201765102", "AffiliationID": "100650104", "AffiliationName": "Ontario Fetal Centre"}, "14029514100": {"Name": "Van Mieghem T.", "AuthorID": "14029514100", "AffiliationID": "100650104", "AffiliationName": "Ontario Fetal Centre"}}}
