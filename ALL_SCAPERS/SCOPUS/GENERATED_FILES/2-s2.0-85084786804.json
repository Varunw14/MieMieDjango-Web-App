We compared CAIDE to Framingham cardiovascular Risk Score (FRS) and FINDRISC diabetes score as predictors of dementia and assessed the role of age in their associations with dementia. We then examined whether these risk scores were associated with dementia in those free of cardiometabolic disease over the follow-up. Methods: A total of 7553 participants, 39-63 years in 1991-1993, were followed for cardiometabolic disease (diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke) and dementia (N = 318) for a mean 23.5 years. Cox regression was used to model associations of age at baseline, CAIDE, FRS, and FINDRISC risk scores with incident dementia. Predictive performance was assessed using Royston's R 2, Harrell's C-index, Akaike's information criterion (AIC), the Greenwood-Nam-D'Agostino (GND) test, and calibration-in-the-large. Age effect was also assessed by stratifying analyses by age group. Finally, in multistate models, we examined whether cardiometabolic risk scores were associated with incidence of dementia in persons who remained free of cardiometabolic disease over the follow-up. Results: Among the risk scores, the predictive performance of CAIDE (C-statistic = 0.714; 95% CI 0.690-0.739) and FRS (C-statistic = 0.719; 95% CI 0.693-0.745) scores was better than FINDRISC (C-statistic = 0.630; 95% CI 0.602-0.659); p < 0.001), AIC difference > 3; R 2 32.5%, 32.0%, and 12.5%, respectively. When the effect of age in these risk scores was removed by drawing data on risk scores at age 55, 60, and 65 years, the association with dementia in all age groups remained for FRS and FINDRISC, but not for CAIDE. Only FRS at age 55 was associated with dementia in persons who remained free of cardiometabolic diseases prior to dementia diagnosis while no such association was observed at older ages for any risk score. Conclusions: Our analyses of CAIDE, FRS, and FINDRISC show the FRS in midlife to predict dementia as well as the CAIDE risk score, its predictive value being also evident among individuals who did not develop cardiometabolic events. The importance of age in the predictive performance of all three risk scores highlights the need for the development of multivariable risk scores in midlife for primary prevention of dementia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CAIDE", "Cardiometabolic risk factors", "Dementia", "Dementia risk score"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aging", "Cardiometabolic Risk Factors", "Dementia", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Risk Assessment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084786804", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"56878986300": {"Name": "Fayosse A.", "AuthorID": "56878986300", "AffiliationID": "60112042, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Inserm U1153, Epidemiology of Ageing and Neurodegenerative Diseases, Universit\u00e9 de Paris"}, "57216817404": {"Name": "Nguyen D.P.", "AuthorID": "57216817404", "AffiliationID": "60112042, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Inserm U1153, Epidemiology of Ageing and Neurodegenerative Diseases, Universit\u00e9 de Paris"}, "23049197900": {"Name": "Dugravot A.", "AuthorID": "23049197900", "AffiliationID": "60112042, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Inserm U1153, Epidemiology of Ageing and Neurodegenerative Diseases, Universit\u00e9 de Paris"}, "35242229200": {"Name": "Dumurgier J.", "AuthorID": "35242229200", "AffiliationID": "60112042, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Inserm U1153, Epidemiology of Ageing and Neurodegenerative Diseases, Universit\u00e9 de Paris"}, "7003480687": {"Name": "Tabak A.G.", "AuthorID": "7003480687", "AffiliationID": "60024812", "AffiliationName": "First Department of Medicine, Semmelweis University, Faculty of Medicine"}, "24339408800": {"Name": "Sabia S.", "AuthorID": "24339408800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "9734197200": {"Name": "Singh-Manoux A.", "AuthorID": "9734197200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivim\u00e4ki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
