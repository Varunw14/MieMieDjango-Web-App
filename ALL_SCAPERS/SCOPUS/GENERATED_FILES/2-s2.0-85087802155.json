The aCeTY line list covers the transition wavenumbers up to 10 000 cm-1 (\u03bb > 1 $\\mu$m), with lower and upper energy levels up to 12 000 and 22 000 cm-1 considered, respectively. The calculations are performed up to a maximum value for the vibrational angular momentum, Kmax = Lmax = 16, and maximum rotational angular momentum, J = 99. Higher values of J were not within the specified wavenumber window. The aCeTY line list is considered to be complete up to 2200 K, making it suitable for use in characterizing high-Temperature exoplanet or cool stellar atmospheres. Einstein-A coefficients, which can directly be used to calculate intensities at a particular temperature, are computed for 4.3 billion (4 347 381 911) transitions between 5 million (5 160 803) energy levels. We make comparisons against other available data for 12C2H2, and demonstrate this to be the most complete line list available. The line list is available in electronic form from the online CDS and ExoMol data bases.", "AuthorKeywords": ["molecular data", "planets and Satellites: Atmospheres", "stars: Atmosphere", "stars: carbon"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087802155", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57190285025": {"Name": "Chubb K.L.", "AuthorID": "57190285025", "AffiliationID": "60001512", "AffiliationName": "Sron Netherlands Institute for Space Research"}, "7101645601": {"Name": "Tennyson J.", "AuthorID": "7101645601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "35605893200": {"Name": "Yurchenko S.N.", "AuthorID": "35605893200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
