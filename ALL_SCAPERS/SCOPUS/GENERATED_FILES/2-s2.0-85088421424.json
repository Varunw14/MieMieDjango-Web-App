The inner solution is matched with the outer solution. The far field of the inner solution is assumed to be far away from the other edge of the plate, and thus, its effect can be neglected. The effects of surface tension, viscous friction, and gravity are accounted for in the fully nonlinear dynamic boundary condition on the free surface. When one of these effects is dominant and the other two can be ignored, it is then possible to use self-similar variables to describe the local flow if the entry speed varies with time in a corresponding manner. Detailed results for various self-similar solutions are provided, and the relative importance of the Weber number, Reynolds number, and Froude number is investigated. Simulations are also undertaken for general non-similar flow, and the comparison with the experimental data is also made.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Dynamic boundary conditions", "Free surfaces", "Fully nonlinear", "Horizontal plates", "Liquid surface", "Self-similar solution", "Velocity potentials", "Viscous friction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088421424", "SubjectAreas": [["Computational Mechanics", "ENGI", "2206"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes", "CENG", "1507"]], "AuthorData": {"55433992900": {"Name": "Sun S.Y.", "AuthorID": "55433992900", "AffiliationID": "60069706", "AffiliationName": "School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology"}, "14012675900": {"Name": "Wu G.X.", "AuthorID": "14012675900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
