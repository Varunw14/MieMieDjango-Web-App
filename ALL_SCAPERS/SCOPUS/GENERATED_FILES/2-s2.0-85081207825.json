Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permission@oup.com.In 1989, Rota made the following conjecture. Given $n$ bases $B_{1},\\dots, B_{n}$ in an $n$-dimensional vector space $V$, one can always find $n$ disjoint bases of $V$, each containing exactly one element from each $B_{i}$ (we call such bases transversal bases). Rota's basis conjecture remains wide open despite its apparent simplicity and the efforts of many researchers (e.g., the conjecture was recently the subject of the collaborative \"Polymath\"project). In this paper we prove that one can always find $\\left (1/2-o\\left (1\\right) \\right) n$ disjoint transversal bases, improving on the previous best bound of $\\Omega \\left (n/\\log n\\right) $. Our results also apply to the more general setting of matroids.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081207825", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"]], "AuthorData": {"57195280517": {"Name": "Buci\u0107 M.", "AuthorID": "57195280517", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, ETH Zurich"}, "35553760600": {"Name": "Sudakov B.", "AuthorID": "35553760600", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, ETH Zurich"}, "56970784500": {"Name": "Kwan M.", "AuthorID": "56970784500", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Stanford University"}, "37087562400": {"Name": "Pokrovskiy A.", "AuthorID": "37087562400", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, Mathematics and Statistics, Birkbeck University of London"}}}
