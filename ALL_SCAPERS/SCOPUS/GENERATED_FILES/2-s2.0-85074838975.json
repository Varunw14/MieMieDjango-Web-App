The Clinical Teacher published by Association for the Study of Medical Education and John Wiley & Sons LtdBackground: Paediatric patients (PPs) often feel that they are not involved in care and treatment decisions. Although training clinicians may help, there is a lack of evaluated training programmes specifically for work with PPs. The aim of this article is to evaluate \u2018Me first\u2019, a training programme aimed at improving clinicians\u2019 attitudes and communication skills when working with PPs. Methods: A total of 69 clinicians attended \u2018Me first\u2019 training and completed questionnaires across three time points: (1) prior to attending the training; (2) at the end of the training; and (3) 4\u20136 weeks later. This included 14 medical staff, 29 nursing staff and 26 allied health staff. Attitude was measured using the Leeds Attitudes to Concordance II (LATCon II) scale, and communication skills were measured using the Effective Listening and Interactive Communication Scale (ELICS). Results: Overall, clinicians reported that their attitude and communication skills improved after attending \u2018Me first\u2019. This was maintained 4\u20136 weeks later. Subgroup analysis showed that allied health staff did not maintain the improved attitude at the follow-up conducted 4\u20136 weeks later. Subgroup analysis showed that allied health staff did not maintain the improved attitude at the follow-up conducted 4\u20136 weeks later. Conclusions: Findings suggest that \u2018Me first\u2019 may be helpful in improving clinician attitudes and communication skills with PPs. Further research should examine whether PPs report higher levels of communication and decision making with clinicians who have attended training.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074838975", "SubjectAreas": [["Review and Exam Preparation", "NURS", "2923"]], "AuthorData": {"24171342400": {"Name": "Hayes D.", "AuthorID": "24171342400", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Evidence Based Practice Unit, University College London and Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}, "56339951200": {"Name": "Edbrooke-Childs J.", "AuthorID": "56339951200", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Evidence Based Practice Unit, University College London and Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}, "57033466000": {"Name": "Martin K.", "AuthorID": "57033466000", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Common Room Consulting"}, "57210889693": {"Name": "Reid J.", "AuthorID": "57210889693", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57217472481": {"Name": "Brown R.", "AuthorID": "57217472481", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57210898513": {"Name": "McCulloch J.", "AuthorID": "57210898513", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57210885835": {"Name": "Morton L.", "AuthorID": "57210885835", "AffiliationID": "60162114", "AffiliationName": "Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
