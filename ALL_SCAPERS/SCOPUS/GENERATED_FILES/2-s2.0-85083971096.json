A critical review of the literature is also provided. Methods: A retrospective review of patients undergoing Draf III for PPT from January 2018 to January 2019 was performed. Results: Four consecutive male patients ranging from 26 to 62 years, with a mean age of 49.5 \u00b1 16.3 years, undergoing Draf III for Pott\u2019s puffy tumour were included. Two patients had a Kuhn type IV frontal cell narrowing the frontonasal pathway and presented without previous sinus surgery, whereas the other two had previous sinus surgery. The success rate of the operation was 100% with an average length of follow-up of 11 months (range 5\u201318). Conclusion: In our experience, the Draf III procedure is a highly effective treatment of PPT. In particular, we have demonstrated it to be very effective in accessing highly positioned Kuhn type IV cells.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Endoscopy", "Frontal sinus", "Frontal sinusitis", "Pott\u2019s puffy tumour"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083971096", "SubjectAreas": [["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"]], "AuthorData": {"57208940637": {"Name": "Pendolino A.L.", "AuthorID": "57208940637", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Ear Institute, UCL"}, "57220242167": {"Name": "Koumpa F.S.", "AuthorID": "57220242167", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Department of ENT, Royal National Ent and Eastman Dental Hospitals"}, "57216590317": {"Name": "Zhang H.", "AuthorID": "57216590317", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Department of ENT, Royal National Ent and Eastman Dental Hospitals"}, "14521750300": {"Name": "Andrews P.J.", "AuthorID": "14521750300", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Ear Institute, UCL"}, "24448312500": {"Name": "Leong S.C.", "AuthorID": "24448312500", "AffiliationID": "60160274", "AffiliationName": "Skull Base Unit, Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Aintree University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
