The associated clinical phenotype is broad and can include chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC) and/or combined immunodeficiency (CID). We report a case of CMC/CID in a 10-year-old boy due to a novel mutation in the small ubiquitin molecule (SUMO) consensus site at the C-terminal region of STAT1 leading to gain-of-function by impaired sumoylation. Immunodysregulatory features of disease improved after Janus kinase inhibitor (jakinib) treatment. Functional testing after treatment confirmed reversal of the STAT1 hyper-phosphorylation and downstream transcriptional activity. IL-17 and IL-22 production was, however, not restored with jakinib therapy (ruxolitinib), and the patient remained susceptible to opportunistic infection. In conclusion, a mutation in the SUMO consensus site of STAT1 can lead to gain-of-function that is reversible with jakinib treatment. However, full immunocompetence was not restored, suggesting that this treatment strategy might serve well as a bridge to definitive therapy such as hematopoietic stem cell transplant rather than a long-term treatment option.", "AuthorKeywords": ["chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis", "combined immunodeficiency", "STAT1", "sumoylation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Candidiasis, Chronic Mucocutaneous", "Child", "Gain of Function Mutation", "Humans", "Janus Kinases", "Male", "Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases", "Pyrazoles", "STAT1 Transcription Factor", "Sumoylation", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073917661", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"56507482100": {"Name": "Al Shehri T.", "AuthorID": "56507482100", "AffiliationID": "60016332", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Immunology Lab, King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre"}, "55820613100": {"Name": "Gothe F.", "AuthorID": "55820613100", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "57202715610": {"Name": "Rowan A.D.", "AuthorID": "57202715610", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "57191859202": {"Name": "Grainger A.", "AuthorID": "57191859202", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "57211438026": {"Name": "Mohanadas T.", "AuthorID": "57211438026", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "7006244214": {"Name": "Cant A.J.", "AuthorID": "7006244214", "AffiliationID": "105837392", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Immunology and BMT, Great North Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "6507443729": {"Name": "Slatter M.A.", "AuthorID": "6507443729", "AffiliationID": "105837392", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Immunology and BMT, Great North Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "6701543518": {"Name": "Hambleton S.", "AuthorID": "6701543518", "AffiliationID": "105837392", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Immunology and BMT, Great North Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "7004838046": {"Name": "Lilic D.", "AuthorID": "7004838046", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "7006078464": {"Name": "Gilmour K.", "AuthorID": "7006078464", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology, Camelia Botnar Laboratories, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "57196961327": {"Name": "Loughlin S.", "AuthorID": "57196961327", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Regional Molecular Genetics Laboratory, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "55927310000": {"Name": "Bibi S.", "AuthorID": "55927310000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Regional Molecular Genetics Laboratory, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "14121426200": {"Name": "Leahy T.R.", "AuthorID": "14121426200", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Children\u2019s Health Ireland"}}}
