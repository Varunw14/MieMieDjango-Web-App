The cells follow specific paths to migrate to different locations of the body where they generate a diverse array of cell types and tissues. There are NCSCs which are maintained in an undifferentiated state throughout the life in the animal tissues. Based on some cells migratory property, we successfully developed a separation strategy to isolate and identify a population of adipose-derived stem cells with neural crest stem cell features in adult bovine adipose tissues within minimally-invasive surgical procedures. The cells have a high degree of multi-potency and self-renewal capabilities, can be cultured and maintained in feeder-free adhesion conditions as monolayer cells, and also be able to grow in the suspension condition in the form of neurosphere. For the purpose of simple description, we name this type cell as bovine adipose-derived neural crest stem cell (baNCSC). Taken together our study describes a readily accessible source of multipotent baNCSC for autologous tissue engineer and cell-based therapeutic researches.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adipose", "Bovine", "Differentiation", "Multipotent", "Neural crest-derived stem cells"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adipogenesis", "Adipose Tissue", "Animals", "Cattle", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell Separation", "Chondrogenesis", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Multipotent Stem Cells", "Neural Crest", "Neural Stem Cells", "Osteogenesis", "Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Spheroids, Cellular"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076001833", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57192181183": {"Name": "Zhang K.", "AuthorID": "57192181183", "AffiliationID": "60083500", "AffiliationName": "Feed and Veterinary Medicine Research Institute, Shanxi Academy of Agriculture Sciences"}, "57208161340": {"Name": "Liu Q.", "AuthorID": "57208161340", "AffiliationID": "60087832", "AffiliationName": "College of Animal Sciences and Veterinary Medicines, Shanxi Agricultural University"}, "57212148946": {"Name": "Cui X.", "AuthorID": "57212148946", "AffiliationID": "60083500", "AffiliationName": "Feed and Veterinary Medicine Research Institute, Shanxi Academy of Agriculture Sciences"}, "57213832026": {"Name": "Zhang B.", "AuthorID": "57213832026", "AffiliationID": "60083500", "AffiliationName": "Feed and Veterinary Medicine Research Institute, Shanxi Academy of Agriculture Sciences"}, "57192178698": {"Name": "Song X.", "AuthorID": "57192178698", "AffiliationID": "60083500", "AffiliationName": "Feed and Veterinary Medicine Research Institute, Shanxi Academy of Agriculture Sciences"}, "7406945743": {"Name": "Yang S.", "AuthorID": "7406945743", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
