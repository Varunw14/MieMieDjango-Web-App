Point mutations result in aberrant conformational transitions that underlie diseases as diverse as cirrhosis, emphysema, thrombosis, angio-oedema and dementia. In view of their common underlying molecular mechanism, we have grouped these together as a novel class of disease: the serpinopathies. We review here the pathobiology of the serpinopathies, with a focus on their clinical features. Specifically, we show how serpinopathies may result from point mutations that cause polymer formation, transition to the latent conformer, inactivation of the inhibitory mechanism as well as failure of secretion (null alleles). We illustrate how a combination of these mechanisms underlies the lung disease associated with AATD. Finally we show that the severity of the mutations in neuroserpin that underlie the dementia FENIB (familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies) can be explained by the rate of polymer formation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083708306", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"56892645500": {"Name": "Lomas D.A.", "AuthorID": "56892645500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Respiratory, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "26643229900": {"Name": "Irving J.A.", "AuthorID": "26643229900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Respiratory, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "6506674023": {"Name": "Gooptu B.", "AuthorID": "6506674023", "AffiliationID": "60009171", "AffiliationName": "Leicester Institute for Structural & Chemical Biology and NIHR Leicester BRC-Respiratory, Glenfield Hospital"}}}
