In order to cater more demands, the operators are looking for solutions to minimize spectral wastage and to extend their network operations beyond the C-band, especially for inter-city networks. This paper highlights the advantages of operating over \\mathrm{C}+\\mathrm{L} band as compared to operations over C band in a large Indian network. The physical model factors in the non-linear interference (NLI) due to inter-channel stimulated Raman scattering (ISRS) and amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise while estimating the optical signal to noise ratio (OSNR) of a network lightpath. The OSNR estimation model can dynamically account for the NLI as compared to the conventional worst case assumption. The capacity benefits for the Indian network over the \\mathrm{C}+\\mathrm{L} band for channel power -1.5 dBm are about 108.67% for channel bandwidth 50 GHz and 103.98% for channel bandwidth 37.5 GHz until 10% of the demands are blocked.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Elastic Optical Networks", "Link Margin", "\\mathrm{C}+\\mathrm{L} band"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amplified spontaneous emission noise", "Backhaul networks", "Channel bandwidth", "Elastic optical networks", "Estimation models", "Network operations", "Network scenario", "Optical signal to noise ratio"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087281515", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"]], "AuthorData": {"57198257993": {"Name": "Mitra A.", "AuthorID": "57198257993", "AffiliationID": "60105479", "AffiliationName": "Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Dept. of Electronics and Communications Engineering"}, "57211061309": {"Name": "Gahlawat N.", "AuthorID": "57211061309", "AffiliationID": "60105479", "AffiliationName": "Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Dept. of Electronics and Communications Engineering"}, "57217479503": {"Name": "Pradhan A.", "AuthorID": "57217479503", "AffiliationID": "60105479", "AffiliationName": "Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Dept. of Electronics and Communications Engineering"}, "57217480954": {"Name": "Dey S.", "AuthorID": "57217480954", "AffiliationID": "60105479", "AffiliationName": "Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Dept. of Electronics and Communications Engineering"}, "55456002000": {"Name": "Srivastava A.", "AuthorID": "55456002000", "AffiliationID": "60105479", "AffiliationName": "Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Dept. of Electronics and Communications Engineering"}, "57192990604": {"Name": "Semrau D.", "AuthorID": "57192990604", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Dept. of Electrical Engineering"}, "7005053644": {"Name": "Bayvel P.", "AuthorID": "7005053644", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Dept. of Electrical Engineering"}, "7101620402": {"Name": "Lord A.", "AuthorID": "7101620402", "AffiliationID": "60031028", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Research British Telecom"}}}
