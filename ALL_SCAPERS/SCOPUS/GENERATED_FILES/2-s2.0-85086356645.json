Impairments in this dynamic process are linked to diverse nervous system diseases and advanced ageing. It is thus essential that we quantitatively study the kinetics of axonal transport to gain an improved understanding of neuropathology as well as the molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating cargo trafficking. One of the best ways to achieve this goal is by imaging individual, fluorescent cargoes in live systems and analyzing the kinetic properties of their progression along the axon. We have therefore developed an intravital technique to visualize different organelles, such as signaling endosomes and mitochondria, being actively transported in the axons of both motor and sensory neurons in live, anesthetized rodents. In this chapter, we provide step-by-step instructions on how to deliver specific organelle-targeting, fluorescent probes using several routes of administration to image individual cargoes being bidirectionally transported along axons within the exposed sciatic nerve. This method can provide detailed, physiologically relevant information on axonal transport, and is thus poised to elucidate mechanisms regulating this process in both health and disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Intravital imaging", "Molecular motor", "Motor neuron", "Neurodegeneration", "Neuromuscular disease", "Neuropathy", "Neurotrophin", "Sciatic nerve", "Sensory neuron", "Tetanus neurotoxin"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086356645", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"36669268900": {"Name": "Sleigh J.N.", "AuthorID": "36669268900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute, University College London"}, "54404094400": {"Name": "Tosolini A.P.", "AuthorID": "54404094400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7005744867": {"Name": "Schiavo G.", "AuthorID": "7005744867", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Discoveries Centre for Regenerative and Precision Medicine, University College London"}}}
