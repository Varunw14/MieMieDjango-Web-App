All rights reserved.Proteomics and metabolomics research offers a quantitative measurement of metabolic profiles associated with exercise and identifies metabolic signatures of athletes from different sporting disciplines. Molecular biomarkers include peptides, proteins, amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids, and xenobiotics. Collectively, these metabolites capture the molecular pathways underlying whole body physiology including nutrition, energy generation, oxidative stress scavenging mechanisms, and hormonal balance. This chapter aims to review the recent literature investigating potential proteomic and metabolomic biomarkers associated with exercise, endurance, and power sports and discuss their functional relevance in relation to athletes\u2019 performance, training, recovery from injury and overall health.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Athletes", "Cardiac Muscle", "Endurance", "Exercise", "Metabolomics", "Power", "Proteomics", "Skeletal Muscle", "Sports"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082602229", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"57190008836": {"Name": "Al-Khelaifi F.", "AuthorID": "57190008836", "AffiliationID": "60182839", "AffiliationName": "UCL-Division of Medicine, Royal Free Campus"}, "6507184948": {"Name": "Elrayess M.A.", "AuthorID": "6507184948", "AffiliationID": "60182839", "AffiliationName": "UCL-Division of Medicine, Royal Free Campus"}, "57203195982": {"Name": "Abraham D.", "AuthorID": "57203195982", "AffiliationID": "60182839", "AffiliationName": "UCL-Division of Medicine, Royal Free Campus"}, "12788772700": {"Name": "Diboun I.", "AuthorID": "12788772700", "AffiliationID": "60104769, 60104772", "AffiliationName": "Qatar Biomedical Research Institute, Hamad Bin Khalifa University"}}}
