All rights reserved.The genus Pseudomonas is an important source of proteases; however, in the food industry the use of this bacterium is restricted. Cloning allows for the use of the proteolytic activity of Pseudomonas proteases through their production in innocuous microorganisms. Leguminous are protein-rich sources from which value-added compounds can be obtained through enzymatic hydrolysis. In this study, an alkaline and thermostable recombinant protease (PT4) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa M211 was cloned and characterized in order to obtain protein hydrolysates from leguminous. Therefore, protease gene was cloned into the pJET1.2 / blunt vector using E. coli DH5\u03b1 as a host. Analysis of protease partial nucleotide sequence showed 99% homology with Peptidases M4 Family from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The molecular weight of the recombinant enzyme was 80 kDa, it was active and stable under alkaline and thermophilic conditions, presented an optimum pH and temperature of 8 and 60 \u00b0C, respectively, and was inhibited by EDTA. In addition, it hydrolysed Glycine max, Phaseolus lunatus, Lupinus mutabilis y Erythrina edulis proteins, obtaining peptide fractions less than 40 kDa. This recombinant protease could be used in the elaboration of functional hydrolysates using protein from different sources and agricultural waste.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cloning", "Leguminous", "Protease", "Protein hydrolysates", "Pseudomonas aeruginosa"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086915362", "SubjectAreas": [["Food Science", "AGRI", "1106"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"57217256680": {"Name": "Kina-Ysa M.", "AuthorID": "57217256680", "AffiliationID": "60071231", "AffiliationName": "Laboratorio de Biolog\u00eda Molecular, Facultad de Farmacia y Bioqu\u00edmica, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos"}, "57204432664": {"Name": "Flores-Fern\u00e1ndez C.N.", "AuthorID": "57204432664", "AffiliationID": "60071231", "AffiliationName": "Laboratorio de Biolog\u00eda Molecular, Facultad de Farmacia y Bioqu\u00edmica, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos"}, "57198443914": {"Name": "Flores-Santos J.C.", "AuthorID": "57198443914", "AffiliationID": "60071231", "AffiliationName": "Laboratorio de Biolog\u00eda Molecular, Facultad de Farmacia y Bioqu\u00edmica, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos"}, "8317424900": {"Name": "Zavaleta A.I.", "AuthorID": "8317424900", "AffiliationID": "60071231", "AffiliationName": "Laboratorio de Biolog\u00eda Molecular, Facultad de Farmacia y Bioqu\u00edmica, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos"}}}
