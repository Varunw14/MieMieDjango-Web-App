These service constraints, coupled with concerns relating to an increased incidence and severity of COVID-19 among patients with cancer, should lead to re-consideration of the risk\u2013benefit balance for standard treatment pathways. This is of particular importance to pancreatic cancer, given that standard diagnostic modalities such as endoscopy may be restricted, and that disease biology precludes significant delays in treatment. In light of this, we sought consensus from UK clinicians with an interest in pancreatic cancer for management approaches that would minimise patient risk and accommodate for healthcare service restrictions. The outcomes are described here and include recommendations for treatment prioritisation, strategies to bridge to later surgical resection in resectable disease and factors that modify the risk\u2013benefit balance for treatment in the resectable through to the metastatic settings. Priority is given to strategies that limit hospital visits, including through the use of hypofractionated precision radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy treatment approaches.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Betacoronavirus", "Consensus", "Coronavirus Infections", "Humans", "Incidence", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Pandemics", "Pneumonia, Viral", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Quarantine", "Risk", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087674171", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"57212989425": {"Name": "Jones C.M.", "AuthorID": "57212989425", "AffiliationID": "60012508", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Cancer Centre, The Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "36105870900": {"Name": "Goody R.", "AuthorID": "36105870900", "AffiliationID": "60012508", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Cancer Centre, The Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "25630849800": {"Name": "Radhakrishna G.", "AuthorID": "25630849800", "AffiliationID": "60028784", "AffiliationName": "The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7101953217": {"Name": "Valle J.W.", "AuthorID": "7101953217", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cancer Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "55356375700": {"Name": "Aitken K.", "AuthorID": "55356375700", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "57203787592": {"Name": "Hunt A.", "AuthorID": "57203787592", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "7003634798": {"Name": "Bridgewater J.", "AuthorID": "7003634798", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Cancer Institute"}, "6602159773": {"Name": "Corrie P.", "AuthorID": "6602159773", "AffiliationID": "60016390", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55775607800": {"Name": "Eatock M.", "AuthorID": "55775607800", "AffiliationID": "108498881", "AffiliationName": "The Northern Ireland Cancer Centre"}, "6701625536": {"Name": "Ghaneh P.", "AuthorID": "6701625536", "AffiliationID": "60023925", "AffiliationName": "The Royal Liverpool University Hospital"}, "57195973564": {"Name": "Good J.", "AuthorID": "57195973564", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"}, "26030375800": {"Name": "Grose D.", "AuthorID": "26030375800", "AffiliationID": "60000265", "AffiliationName": "Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre"}, "57191157403": {"Name": "Holyoake D.", "AuthorID": "57191157403", "AffiliationID": "60017129", "AffiliationName": "Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004717554": {"Name": "Jamieson N.B.", "AuthorID": "7004717554", "AffiliationID": "60001574, 60001490", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Wohl Cancer Research Centre, University of Glasgow"}, "8753793600": {"Name": "Palmer D.H.", "AuthorID": "8753793600", "AffiliationID": "60020661, 60170150", "AffiliationName": "Liverpool Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre, University of Liverpool"}, "6603059226": {"Name": "Soonawalla Z.", "AuthorID": "6603059226", "AffiliationID": "60170323", "AffiliationName": "Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "9275515900": {"Name": "Hawkins M.A.", "AuthorID": "9275515900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "12902771600": {"Name": "Mukherjee S.", "AuthorID": "12902771600", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "CRUK/MRC Oxford Institute for Radiation Oncology, University of Oxford"}}}
