Drug prediction models can offer better patient data classification, optimising sensitivity identification in cancer therapy for suitable drugs. In this paper, a computational model based on Deep Neural Networks has been designed for prediction of anti-cancer drug response based on genetic expression data using publicly available drug profiling datasets from Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE). The model consists of several parts, including continuous drug response prediction, discretization and a drug sensitivity result output. Regularization and compression of neuron connections is also implemented to make the model compact and efficient, outperforming other widely used algorithms, such as elastic net (EN), random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR) and simple artificial neural network (ANN) in sensitivity analysis and predictive accuracy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer treatment", "Computational model", "Deep Neural Network", "Drug sensitivity prediction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anticancer drug", "Cancer cell lines", "Computational model", "Drug sensitivity", "Genetic expressions", "Prediction model", "Predictive accuracy", "Support vector regression (SVR)"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077033695", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"57212549813": {"Name": "Zhao Z.", "AuthorID": "57212549813", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering"}, "55488020900": {"Name": "Li K.", "AuthorID": "55488020900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Bio-Inspired Technology, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "57209086570": {"Name": "Toumazou C.", "AuthorID": "57209086570", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Bio-Inspired Technology, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "51665421200": {"Name": "Kalofonou M.", "AuthorID": "51665421200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Bio-Inspired Technology, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Imperial College London"}}}
