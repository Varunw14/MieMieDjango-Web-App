One key difference with invertebrates and \u201clower\u201d vertebrates like fish and amphibians is that amniotes do not rely so heavily on maternal messages because the zygotic genome is activated very early. Early development also involves considerable growth in volume and mass of the embryo, with cell cycles that include G1 and G2 phases from very early cleavage. The very early maternal to zygotic transition also allows the embryo to establish its own polarity without relying heavily on maternal determinants. In many amniotes including avians and non-rodent mammals, this enables an ability of the embryo to \u201cregulate\u201d: a single multicellular embryo can give rise to more than one individual\u2014monozygotic twins. Here we discuss the embryological, cellular, molecular and evolutionary underpinnings of gastrulation in avian embryos as a model amniote embryo. Many of these properties are shared by human embryos.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blastoderm", "Cell movements", "Conjoined twins", "Embryonic regulation", "Epiblast", "Monozygotic", "Regeneration", "Twins"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075360035", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57211926002": {"Name": "Raffaelli A.", "AuthorID": "57211926002", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell & Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "7201805780": {"Name": "Stern C.", "AuthorID": "7201805780", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell & Developmental Biology, University College London"}}}
