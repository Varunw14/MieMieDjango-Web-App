Methods: We used a case-crossover design nested in a community cohort to compare self-reported measures of activities during the week before infection onset and baseline periods. The design eliminates the effect of non-time-varying confounders. Time-varying confounders were addressed by exclusion of illnesses around the Christmas period and seasonal adjustment. Results: 626 participants had paired data from the week before 1005 illnesses and the week before baseline. Each additional day of undertaking the following activities in the prior week was associated with illness onset: Spending more than five minutes in a room with someone (other than a household member) who has a cold (Seasonally adjusted OR 1\u00b715, p =0\u00b7003); use of underground trains (1\u00b731, p=0\u00b7036); use of supermarkets (1\u00b732, p<0\u00b7001); attending a theatre, cinema or concert (1\u00b726, p=0\u00b7032); eating out at a cafe, restaurant or canteen (1\u00b725, p=0\u00b7003); and attending parties (1\u00b747, p<0\u00b7001). Undertaking the following activities at least once in the previous week was associated with illness onset: using a bus, (aOR 1.48, p=0.049), shopping at small shops (1.9, p<0.002) attending a place of worship (1.81, p=0.005). Conclusions: Exposure to potentially crowded places, public transport and to individuals with a cold increases risk of acquiring circulating acute respiratory infections. This suggests social distancing measures can have an important impact on slowing transmission of emerging respiratory infections.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acute respiratory infection", "COVID-19", "Pandemic", "Social distancing", "Transmission"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092435581", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"35944648500": {"Name": "Hayward A.C.", "AuthorID": "35944648500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, UCL"}, "57201135435": {"Name": "Beale S.", "AuthorID": "57201135435", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Public Health Data Science Research Group, Institute of Health Informatics, UCL"}, "57199426537": {"Name": "Fragaszy E.B.", "AuthorID": "57199426537", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57203665921": {"Name": "Johnson A.M.", "AuthorID": "57203665921", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Global Health, UCL"}, "8644765500": {"Name": "Cowling B.J.", "AuthorID": "8644765500", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "The University of Hong Kong"}, "6603299036": {"Name": "Uzicanin A.", "AuthorID": "6603299036", "AffiliationID": "60021658", "AffiliationName": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}}
