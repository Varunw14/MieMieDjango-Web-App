We show that stabilization of G-quadruplexes using small molecules destabilizes the i-motifs, and vice versa, indicating these gene regulatory controllers are interdependent in human cells. This has important implications as these structures are predominately considered as isolated structural targets for therapy, but their interdependency highlights the interplay of both structures as an important gene regulatory switch.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85097575631", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Colloid and Surface Chemistry", "CENG", "1505"]], "AuthorData": {"57220765018": {"Name": "King J.J.", "AuthorID": "57220765018", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "School of Molecular Sciences, University of Western Australia"}, "57215125711": {"Name": "Irving K.L.", "AuthorID": "57215125711", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "School of Molecular Sciences, University of Western Australia"}, "56282439000": {"Name": "Evans C.W.", "AuthorID": "56282439000", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "School of Molecular Sciences, University of Western Australia"}, "57200834148": {"Name": "Iyer K.S.", "AuthorID": "57200834148", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "School of Molecular Sciences, University of Western Australia"}, "55850755000": {"Name": "Smith N.M.", "AuthorID": "55850755000", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "School of Molecular Sciences, University of Western Australia"}, "26326126300": {"Name": "Chikhale R.V.", "AuthorID": "26326126300", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "57220763641": {"Name": "Becker R.", "AuthorID": "57220763641", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University of East Anglia"}, "55708883900": {"Name": "Morris C.J.", "AuthorID": "55708883900", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University of East Anglia"}, "23974080500": {"Name": "Waller Z.A.E.", "AuthorID": "23974080500", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "57220770147": {"Name": "Pe\u00f1a Martinez C.D.", "AuthorID": "57220770147", "AffiliationID": "60002773, 60111214", "AffiliationName": "Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Darlinghurst"}, "57219821496": {"Name": "Schofield P.", "AuthorID": "57219821496", "AffiliationID": "60028333, 60017448", "AffiliationName": "St Vincent's Clinical School, Faculty of Medicine, University of New South Wales, Kensington"}, "7005298324": {"Name": "Christ D.", "AuthorID": "7005298324", "AffiliationID": "60028333, 60017448", "AffiliationName": "St Vincent's Clinical School, Faculty of Medicine, University of New South Wales, Kensington"}, "7101946170": {"Name": "Hurley L.H.", "AuthorID": "7101946170", "AffiliationID": "60010065", "AffiliationName": "College of Pharmacy, University of Arizona"}}}
