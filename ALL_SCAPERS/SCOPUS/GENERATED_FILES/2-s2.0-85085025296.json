Few in vitro studies investigate its effects towards cancer cells or endothelial cells in the presence of cancer. We tested the effect of Pazopanib on renal cell carcinoma cells (CAKI-2,786-O) in two-dimensional and three-dimensional tumouroids made of dense extracellular matrix, treated in normoxia and hypoxia. Finally, we engineered complex tumouroids with a stromal compartment containing fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Simple CAKI-2 tumouroids were more resistant to Pazopanib than 786-O tumouroids. Under hypoxia, while the more \u2018resistant\u2019 CAKI-2 tumouroids showed no decrease in viability, 786-O tumouroids required higher Pazopanib concentrations to induce cell death. In complex tumouroids, Pazopanib exposure led to a reduction in the overall cell viability (p < 0.0001), disruption of endothelial networks and direct killing of renal cell carcinoma cells. We report a biomimetic multicellular tumouroid for drug testing, suitable for agents whose primary target is not confined to cancer cells.", "AuthorKeywords": ["2D versus 3D culture", "in vitro endothelial networks", "Pazopanib", "renal cell carcinoma", "tumouroid"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085025296", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"55212600600": {"Name": "Stamati K.", "AuthorID": "55212600600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Surgical Biotechnology, Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London"}, "57206313007": {"Name": "Redondo P.A.", "AuthorID": "57206313007", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Surgical Biotechnology, Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London"}, "54393816500": {"Name": "Nyga A.", "AuthorID": "54393816500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Surgical Biotechnology, Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London"}, "57194391748": {"Name": "Neves J.B.", "AuthorID": "57194391748", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Specialist Centre for Kidney Cancer, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57216523282": {"Name": "Tran M.G.B.", "AuthorID": "57216523282", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Specialist Centre for Kidney Cancer, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57204294898": {"Name": "Loizidou M.", "AuthorID": "57204294898", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Surgical Biotechnology, Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London"}, "7004667094": {"Name": "Emberton M.", "AuthorID": "7004667094", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "9238779300": {"Name": "Cheema U.", "AuthorID": "9238779300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Targeted Intervention, Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London"}}}
