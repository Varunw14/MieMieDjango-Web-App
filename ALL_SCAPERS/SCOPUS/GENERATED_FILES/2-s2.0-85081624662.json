There is currently no consensus on the best surgical therapy. We aimed at comparing conservative sinusectomy (S) to excision and paramedian primary closure (PC). Methods: This is a randomized controlled trial compatible with the CONSORT statement standards. We included all patients with chronic PD between 2012 and 2017. We excluded patients with acute abscesses, recurrent PD after surgery with a curative intent and patients needing complex reconstructions with rotation flaps. Patients with chronic symptomatic PD were randomized to S or PC. Primary end-point was the rate of patients healed at 3 weeks, secondary outcomes were total healing time, pain, time off work, patient satisfaction and recurrence at 1 year. Patients were seen at a wound clinic until healed and contacted at 3, 6, and 12 months for follow-up. Results: After inclusion of 58 patients the study was stopped prematurely due to discrepancy between expected and observed outcomes. Only 4/30 (13.3%) patients in the S group had healed completely at 3 weeks compared with 14/28 (50%) in the PC group (p = 0.01). Median time to complete healing was 54 (23\u2013328) days in the S group compared to 34 (13\u2013141) in the PC group (p = 0.025). Number of outpatient visits, time off work, analgesia requirement, and recurrence rates at 12 months 4 (16%) in the S group and 3 (11.1%) in the PC group (p = 0.548) were similar. Conclusions: PC leads to faster healing compared to S, with similar healthcare burden. Trial Registration: The study was approved by the local ethics committee and registered inwww.clinicaltrials.gov(REF: NCT03271996).
