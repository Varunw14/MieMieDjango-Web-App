The composition of the nanofluid, internal flow type of droplet and the rate of drying affect drop geometry, and the final pattern. Using poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-block-poly(ethylene glycol)(PLGA-b-PEG) as the example, we produced micro-stripe patterning from nanoparticles by drying of sessile fluid droplets. We investigated the nanoparticle properties and flow dynamics to clarify their effects on the patterning. Nanoparticles were prepared by hydrodynamic flow focusing using a T-junction microfluidic device with high production efficiency and the ability to generate an extremely narrow size distribution. PLGA-b-PEG was prepared as oil phase in acetonitrile and water/oil flow rate was changed from 1 to 3 at constant oil phase flow rate (50 \u03bcL/min). Then, nanofluid was collected on the surface as sessile droplets within acetonitrile/water binary dispersed phase. Depending on size, charge and size-distribution, the nanoparticles deposited on the surface exhibited various patterns. Dynamic Light and X-ray Scattering measurements showed that, approximately 100 nm particles with relatively low PDI (0.04) were produced for the first time in surfactant free conditions in a microfluidic device and they generated self-assembled ordered patterns, which are regulated by the type of internal flow in the sessile nanofluid droplet during sequential evaporation of acetonitrile and water.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coffee-ring", "Hydrodynamic flow focusing", "Nanofluid", "Self-assembly"], "IndexKeywords": ["Coffee rings", "Hydrodynamic flows", "Micro-fluidic devices", "Nanofluids", "Nanoparticle properties", "Narrow size distributions", "Poly lactic-co-glycolic acid", "X-ray scattering measurements"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075824578", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Colloid and Surface Chemistry", "CENG", "1505"]], "AuthorData": {"56598063500": {"Name": "Gultekinoglu M.", "AuthorID": "56598063500", "AffiliationID": "60020484", "AffiliationName": "Bioengineering Division, Institute for Graduate Studies in Science & Engineering, Hacettepe University"}, "6603354213": {"Name": "Ulubayram K.", "AuthorID": "6603354213", "AffiliationID": "60020484", "AffiliationName": "Polymer Science and Technology Division, Institute for Graduate Studies in Science & Engineering, Hacettepe University"}, "57202195637": {"Name": "Jiang X.", "AuthorID": "57202195637", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "7006247915": {"Name": "Edirisinghe M.", "AuthorID": "7006247915", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "24334063400": {"Name": "Bayram C.", "AuthorID": "24334063400", "AffiliationID": "60020484", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Technologies Application and Research Center, Hacettepe University"}, "56130059200": {"Name": "Wu H.", "AuthorID": "56130059200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}}}
