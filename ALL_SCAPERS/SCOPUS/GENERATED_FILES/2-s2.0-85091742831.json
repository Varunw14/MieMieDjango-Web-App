Patients and Methods: All adult (\u226518 years) deaths recorded in England and Wales (March 1, 2020, to May 12, 2020) were analyzed retrospectively. We compared the prevalence of underlying health conditions between COVID and non\u2013COVID-related deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic and the age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) of COVID-19 compared with other primary causes of death, stratified by sex and age group. Results: Of 144,279 adult deaths recorded during the study period, 36,438 (25.3%) were confirmed COVID deaths. Women represented 43.2% (n=15,731) of COVID deaths compared with 51.9% (n=55,980) in non-COVID deaths. Overall, COVID deaths were younger than non-COVID deaths (82 vs 83 years). ASMR of COVID-19 was higher than all other common primary causes of death, across age groups and sexes, except for cancers in women between the ages of 30 and 79 years. A linear relationship was observed between ASMR and age among COVID-19 deaths, with persistently higher rates in men than women across all age groups. The most prevalent reported conditions were hypertension, dementia, chronic lung disease, and diabetes, and these were higher among COVID deaths. Pre-existing ischemic heart disease was similar in COVID (11.4%) and non-COVID (12%) deaths. Conclusion: In a nationwide analysis, COVID-19 infection was associated with higher age-standardized mortality than other primary causes of death, except cancer in women of select age groups. COVID-19 mortality was persistently higher in men and increased with advanced age.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age Distribution", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Betacoronavirus", "Cause of Death", "Coronavirus Infections", "England", "Female", "Healthcare Disparities", "Hospital Mortality", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pandemics", "Pneumonia, Viral", "Retrospective Studies", "Sex Distribution", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Wales"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091742831", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57194714995": {"Name": "Mohamed M.O.", "AuthorID": "57194714995", "AffiliationID": "60029028", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Royal Stoke University Hospital"}, "56828761200": {"Name": "Rashid M.", "AuthorID": "56828761200", "AffiliationID": "60029028", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Royal Stoke University Hospital"}, "57217797378": {"Name": "Mamas M.A.", "AuthorID": "57217797378", "AffiliationID": "60029028", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Royal Stoke University Hospital"}, "35837808000": {"Name": "Gale C.P.", "AuthorID": "35837808000", "AffiliationID": "60012508", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "57194400210": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "57194400210", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute for Data Analytics, University of Leeds"}, "14050735100": {"Name": "Kontopantelis E.", "AuthorID": "14050735100", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Division of Informatics, Imaging and Data Science, University of Manchester"}, "57207811587": {"Name": "Doran T.", "AuthorID": "57207811587", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of York"}, "7005701907": {"Name": "de Belder M.", "AuthorID": "7005701907", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "55931970200": {"Name": "Asaria M.", "AuthorID": "55931970200", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "London School of Economics"}, "57220565320": {"Name": "Luscher T.", "AuthorID": "57220565320", "AffiliationID": "60022023", "AffiliationName": "Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57219224014": {"Name": "Stephenson C.", "AuthorID": "57219224014", "AffiliationID": "118468364", "AffiliationName": "NHS Digital"}, "57218393103": {"Name": "Denwood T.", "AuthorID": "57218393103", "AffiliationID": "118468364", "AffiliationName": "NHS Digital"}, "57218398589": {"Name": "Roebuck C.", "AuthorID": "57218398589", "AffiliationID": "118468364", "AffiliationName": "NHS Digital"}, "7004333788": {"Name": "Deanfield J.", "AuthorID": "7004333788", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
