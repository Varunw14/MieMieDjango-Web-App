Having considered the concepts of disadvantaged or non-traditional groups deployed in previous studies, a survey questionnaire was designed to investigate how certain factors are related to students\u2019 belonging. Statistical analysis of data from 380 participants reveals that students\u2019 sense of belonging and retention are crucially influenced by both academic engagement and social engagement, but independently. This study also addresses a lack of research about how the critical factors for disadvantage operate to determine belonging and retention in higher education. The findings should prompt a re-evaluation what we consider to be the sources of \u2018disadvantage\u2019, such as social class, age and ethnicity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["disadvantage", "engagement", "higher education", "questionnaire", "retention", "Sense of belonging"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086914737", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"57205403694": {"Name": "Ahn M.Y.", "AuthorID": "57205403694", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London (UCL)"}, "7402189238": {"Name": "Davis H.H.", "AuthorID": "7402189238", "AffiliationID": "60025779, 60170561", "AffiliationName": "School of History, Philosophy and Social Sciences, Bangor University"}}}
