To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that HPA is conjugated to a HyA-based backbone. In situ hydrogelation of HyA-DA-HPA occurred in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as an oxidant and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as a catalyst. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were used to characterize the chemical reactions between HyA, DA, and HPA. Gel formation completed between 3 s to 5 min depending on the concentrations of polymer, HRP, and H2O2. Crosslinked HyA-DA-HPA gels acquired storage moduli ranging from \u223c100 Pa to \u223c20 000 Pa (at f = 2000 rad s-1). Biocompatibility of the hydrogels was examined with human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural stem cells. The hydrogels made of 2.0 w/v% HyA-DA-HPA hydrogels, 0.24 U ml-1 HRP and \u2264 0.5 \u00b5mol ml-1 H2O2 were found biocompatible with hMSCs cultured on and encapsulated within the hydrogels. Since HyA serves as a backbone of the extracellular matrix in the central nervous system (CNS) and DA acquires the ability to restore dopaminergic neurons, use of this injectable HyA-DA-HPA hydrogel for stem cell transplantation is a potential treatment strategy for CNS repair and regeneration.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dopamine", "hyaluronic acid", "injectable hydrogel", "neural regeneration"], "IndexKeywords": ["Central nervous systems", "Dopaminergic neurons", "Extracellular matrices", "Horseradish peroxidase", "Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs)", "Human-induced pluripotent stem cells", "Proton nuclear magnetic resonance", "Stem cell transplantation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088495165", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"57200406492": {"Name": "Nguyen L.T.B.", "AuthorID": "57200406492", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "57194336179": {"Name": "Hsu C.C.", "AuthorID": "57194336179", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford"}, "54394773900": {"Name": "Ye H.", "AuthorID": "54394773900", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford"}, "7202504467": {"Name": "Cui Z.", "AuthorID": "7202504467", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford"}}}
