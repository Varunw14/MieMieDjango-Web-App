Yet, it is not fully understood the extent by which these systemic medications affect ocular structures and whether they may increase or decrease the risk of sight-threatening ocular diseases. This review provides a summary of reported associations between different systemic medications and the risk of developing glaucoma or experiencing disease progression. Medication classes covered in this review that are known to or may modulate the risk of open-angle glaucoma include corticosteroids, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, metformin, statins, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, bupropion, postmenopausal hormones, and cannabinoids. Medication classes addressed in this review that may increase the risk of angle closure glaucoma include anticholinergics, adrenergic agonists, certain classes of antidepressants, sulfonamides, and topiramate.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076556969", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"]], "AuthorData": {"57212380413": {"Name": "Wu A.", "AuthorID": "57212380413", "AffiliationID": "60033182", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Michigan Medical School"}, "7402750685": {"Name": "Stein J.D.", "AuthorID": "7402750685", "AffiliationID": "60016660", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Management and Policy, University of Michigan School of Public Health"}, "55195093800": {"Name": "Khawaja A.P.", "AuthorID": "55195093800", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7003824401": {"Name": "Pasquale L.R.", "AuthorID": "7003824401", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}}}
