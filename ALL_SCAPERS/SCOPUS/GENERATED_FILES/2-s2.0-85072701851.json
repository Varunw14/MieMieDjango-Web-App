The current study is the first to investigate UK dental professionals' knowledge of autism, their perceived confidence when treating autistic patients, and the factors that affect this. Methods An online, self-report survey was completed by 482 UK dental professionals and included questions on participants' training, prior experiences and knowledge of autism, and confidence when treating autistic patients. Results Over half the respondents reported having no formal autism training but average knowledge levels across the whole sample were good. Conversely, levels of confidence were only moderate. Respondents often cited conflict between understanding the additional needs for successful treatment of autistic patients and a lack of resources to implement support strategies. Despite this, the vast majority were positive about making the necessary modifications to support autistic patients. Conclusion This study highlights ways in which UK dental professionals adapt their practices to meet the needs of their autistic patients, yet report only moderate confidence levels when doing so. Implications for future training initiatives are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Autistic Disorder", "Humans", "Self Report", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072701851", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"57211120015": {"Name": "Eades D.", "AuthorID": "57211120015", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Research in Autism and Education, Department of Psychology and Human Development, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "57211121343": {"Name": "Leung P.", "AuthorID": "57211121343", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Research in Autism and Education, Department of Psychology and Human Development, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "16403276300": {"Name": "Remington A.", "AuthorID": "16403276300", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Research in Autism and Education, Department of Psychology and Human Development, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "57190958571": {"Name": "Cronin A.", "AuthorID": "57190958571", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "King\u2019s College Hospital"}, "35095440000": {"Name": "Monteiro J.", "AuthorID": "35095440000", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Eastman Dental Hospital"}, "7410016771": {"Name": "Johnson A.", "AuthorID": "7410016771", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Eastman Dental Hospital"}}}
