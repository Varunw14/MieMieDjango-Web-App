Memory B and T cells initiate a rapid and robust immune response upon encounter with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, thus achieving long-lasting protection against infection. Recent studies have shown, however, that innate immune cell populations such as myeloid cells and NK cells also undergo functional adaptation after infection or vaccination, a de facto innate immune memory that is also termed trained immunity. Experimental and epidemiological data have shown that induction of trained immunity contributes to the beneficial heterologous effects of vaccines such as bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), the licensed TB vaccine. Moreover, increasing evidence argues that trained immunity also contributes to the anti-TB effects of BCG vaccination. An interaction among immunological signals, metabolic rewiring, and epigenetic reprogramming underlies the molecular mechanisms mediating trained immunity in myeloid cells and their bone marrow progenitors. Future studies are warranted to explore the untapped potential of trained immunity to develop a future generation of TB vaccines that would combine innate and adaptive immune memory induction.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["BCG Vaccine", "Humans", "Immunity, Innate", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Tuberculosis", "Vaccination"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071752173", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"8708588100": {"Name": "Khader S.A.", "AuthorID": "8708588100", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Microbiology, Washington University, School of Medicine in St. Louis"}, "6508303533": {"Name": "Divangahi M.", "AuthorID": "6508303533", "AffiliationID": "60023245, 60006558, 60029502", "AffiliationName": "Meakins-Christie Laboratories, Department of Medicine, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Department of Pathology, McGill International TB Centre, McGill University Health Centre"}, "57203977065": {"Name": "Hanekom W.", "AuthorID": "57203977065", "AffiliationID": "60022241", "AffiliationName": "Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation"}, "56684882100": {"Name": "Makar K.W.", "AuthorID": "56684882100", "AffiliationID": "60022241", "AffiliationName": "Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation"}, "12779383000": {"Name": "Hill P.C.", "AuthorID": "12779383000", "AffiliationID": "60100347", "AffiliationName": "Centre for International Health, Department of Preventive and Social Medicine, University of Otago Medical School"}, "57213740270": {"Name": "Maeurer M.", "AuthorID": "57213740270", "AffiliationID": "60113883", "AffiliationName": "Immuno Surgery Unit, Champalimaud Foundation"}, "36027743600": {"Name": "Mayer-Barber K.D.", "AuthorID": "36027743600", "AffiliationID": "60017336, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Inflammation and Innate Immunity Unit, Laboratory of Clinical Immunology and Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH"}, "6507704195": {"Name": "Mhlanga M.M.", "AuthorID": "6507704195", "AffiliationID": "60010932, 60000356", "AffiliationName": "Division of Chemical Systems and Synthetic Biology, Institute for Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine (IDM), Faculty of Health Sciences, Department of Integrative Biomedical Sciences, University of Cape Town"}, "9234176700": {"Name": "Nemes E.", "AuthorID": "9234176700", "AffiliationID": "60095279, 60000356", "AffiliationName": "South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative, Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, Division of Immunology, Department of Pathology, University of Cape Town"}, "7006431257": {"Name": "Schlesinger L.S.", "AuthorID": "7006431257", "AffiliationID": "60024426", "AffiliationName": "Texas Biomedical Research Institute"}, "6603956378": {"Name": "Van Crevel R.", "AuthorID": "6603956378", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Radboud Center for Infectious Diseases, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "35378641700": {"Name": "Netea M.G.", "AuthorID": "35378641700", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Department for Genomics and Immunoregulation, Life and Medical Sciences Institute (LIMES), University of Bonn"}, "57210885390": {"Name": "Vankalayapati R.", "AuthorID": "57210885390", "AffiliationID": "60002228", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pulmonary Immunology, Center for Biomedical Research, University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler"}, "7006636647": {"Name": "Xavier R.J.", "AuthorID": "7006636647", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Center for Microbiome Informatics and Therapeutics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
