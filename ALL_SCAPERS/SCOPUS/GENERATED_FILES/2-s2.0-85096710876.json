Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of American Neurological AssociationObjective: Huntington\u2019s disease is a rare, genetic, neurodegenerative disease characterized by a triad of cognitive, behavioral, and motor symptoms. The condition gradually results in increasing disability, loss of independence, and ultimately death. Our objective was to use United States claims data (which offer valuable insight into the natural history of disease) to compare the prevalent comorbidities of people with Huntington\u2019s disease against matched controls with Parkinson\u2019s disease or with no major neurodegenerative diseases (general population controls). We also assess medication use in people with Huntington\u2019s disease. Methods: This was a retrospective, observational study using data from the IBM MarketScan\u00ae Databases. Cases and controls were matched 1:1, and comorbidities were analyzed in each group during 2017. Medications were also assessed in the Huntington\u2019s disease cohort. Eligible cases had \u2265 2 diagnostic codes for Huntington\u2019s disease; controls had \u2265 2 codes for Parkinson\u2019s disease (with no record of Huntington\u2019s disease), or, for general population controls, no record of Huntington\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or dementia. Results: A total of 587 matched individuals were assessed in each cohort. Depression and anxiety were more common in Huntington\u2019s disease versus Parkinson\u2019s disease (odds ratios: 1.51 and 1.16, respectively). Other conditions more common in Huntington\u2019s disease included dementia, communication/speech problems, dysphagia, and falls. The use of antidepressant (59.9%) and antipsychotic (39.5%) medications was frequent among Huntington\u2019s disease cases. Interpretation: These data highlight the prevalence of psychiatric, cognitive, communication, swallowing, and mobility problems in people with Huntington\u2019s disease, underscoring the need for holistic expert care of these individuals.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096710876", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"8885967900": {"Name": "Ishihara L.", "AuthorID": "8885967900", "AffiliationID": "60001946", "AffiliationName": "Roche Products Ltd"}, "57193906490": {"Name": "Oliveri D.", "AuthorID": "57193906490", "AffiliationID": "114548069", "AffiliationName": "Genesis Research"}, "57206324805": {"Name": "Wild E.J.", "AuthorID": "57206324805", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Huntington\u2019s Disease Centre, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
