This study proposes an innovative hybrid modeling framework which takes advantages of both physics-based and data-driven modeling for bioprocess online monitoring, prediction, and optimization. The framework initially generates high-quality data by correcting raw process measurements via a physics-based noise filter (a generally available simple kinetic model with high fitting but low predictive performance); then constructs a predictive data-driven model to identify optimal control actions and predict discrete future bioprocess behaviors. Continuous future process trajectories are subsequently visualized by re-fitting the simple kinetic model (soft sensor) using the data-driven model predicted discrete future data points, enabling the accurate monitoring of ongoing processes at any operating time. This framework was tested to maximize fed-batch microalgal lutein production by combining with different online optimization schemes and compared against the conventional open-loop optimization technique. The optimal results using the proposed framework were found to be comparable to the theoretically best production, demonstrating its high predictive and flexible capabilities as well as its potential for industrial application.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bioprocess optimization", "data recalibration", "fed-batch operation", "kinetic modeling", "machine learning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bioprocess optimization", "Fed-batch operation", "Industrial measurements", "Kinetic modeling", "Predictive performance", "Process measurements", "Recalibrations", "Visualization technique", "Biomass", "Bioreactors", "Computer Simulation", "Kinetics", "Microalgae", "Models, Biological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072849492", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology", "IMMU", "2402"]], "AuthorData": {"56535576900": {"Name": "Zhang D.", "AuthorID": "56535576900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Systems Engineering, South Kensington Campus, Imperial College London"}, "57200496790": {"Name": "Petsagkourakis P.", "AuthorID": "57200496790", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Systems Engineering, University College London"}, "56537019200": {"Name": "Del Rio-Chanona E.A.", "AuthorID": "56537019200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Systems Engineering, South Kensington Campus, Imperial College London"}, "56157626700": {"Name": "Wagner J.", "AuthorID": "56157626700", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Loughborough University"}}}
