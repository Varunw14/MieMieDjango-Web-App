Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd | Disease Models & Mechanisms (2020) 13, dmm043091. doi:10.1242/dmm.043091Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite capable of invading any nucleated cell. Three main clonal lineages (type I, II, III) exist and murine models have driven the understanding of general and strain-specific immune mechanisms underlying Toxoplasma infection. However, murine models are limited for studying parasite-leukocyte interactions in vivo, and discrepancies exist between cellular immune responses observed in mouse versus human cells. Here, we developed a zebrafish infection model to study the innate immune response to Toxoplasma in vivo. By infecting the zebrafish hindbrain ventricle, and using high-resolution microscopy techniques coupled with computer vision-driven automated image analysis, we reveal that Toxoplasma invades brain cells and replicates inside a parasitophorous vacuole to which type I and III parasites recruit host cell mitochondria. We also show that type II and III strains maintain a higher infectious burden than type I strains. To understand how parasites are cleared in vivo, we further analyzed Toxoplasma-macrophage interactions using time-lapse microscopy and three-dimensional correlative light and electron microscopy (3D CLEM). Time-lapse microscopy revealed that macrophages are recruited to the infection site and play a key role in Toxoplasma control. High-resolution 3D CLEM revealed parasitophorous vacuole breakage in brain cells and macrophages in vivo, suggesting that cell-intrinsic mechanisms may be used to destroy the intracellular niche of tachyzoites. Together, our results demonstrate in vivo control of Toxoplasma by macrophages, and highlight the possibility that zebrafish may be further exploited as a novel model system for discoveries within the field of parasite immunity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CLEM", "In vivo", "Macrophages", "Toxoplasma gondii", "Zebrafish"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089787035", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (miscellaneous)", "NEUR", "2801"], ["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (miscellaneous)", "IMMU", "2401"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"57190619913": {"Name": "Yoshida N.", "AuthorID": "57190619913", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection Biology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "6506948643": {"Name": "Frickel E.M.", "AuthorID": "6506948643", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Microbiology and Infection, School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham"}, "55892077300": {"Name": "Mazon-Moya M.J.", "AuthorID": "55892077300", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Section of Microbiology, MRC Centre for Molecular Bacteriology and Infection, Imperial College London"}, "6602332720": {"Name": "Mostowy S.", "AuthorID": "6602332720", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection Biology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "55525495100": {"Name": "Domart M.C.", "AuthorID": "55525495100", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Electron Microscopy Science Technology Platform, Francis Crick Institute"}, "55516132200": {"Name": "Peddie C.J.", "AuthorID": "55516132200", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Electron Microscopy Science Technology Platform, Francis Crick Institute"}, "6603098541": {"Name": "Collinson L.", "AuthorID": "6603098541", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Electron Microscopy Science Technology Platform, Francis Crick Institute"}, "55357165600": {"Name": "Yakimovich A.", "AuthorID": "55357165600", "AffiliationID": "124969337", "AffiliationName": "Artificial Intelligence for Life Sciences CIC"}, "14121881600": {"Name": "Mercer J.", "AuthorID": "14121881600", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Microbiology and Infection, School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham"}, "24080134800": {"Name": "Hawkins T.A.", "AuthorID": "24080134800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}}}
