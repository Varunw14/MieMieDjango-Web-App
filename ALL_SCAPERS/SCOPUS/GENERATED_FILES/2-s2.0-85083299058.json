However, this has been difficult to test experimentally. We report two preregistered social interaction studies that tested (i) whether paranoia predicted overall attribution and peak attribution of harmful intent and (ii) whether anxiety, interpersonal sensitivity and worry predicted the attribution of harmful intent. In Study 1, we recruited a large general population sample (N = 987) who serially interacted with other participants in multi-round dictator games and matched to fair, partially fair or unfair partners. Participants rated attributions of harmful intent and self-interest after each interaction. In Study 2 (N = 1011), a new sample of participants completed the same procedure and additionally completed measures of anxiety, worry and interpersonal sensitivity. As predicted, prior paranoid ideation was associated with higher and faster overall harmful intent attributions, whereas attributions of self-interest were unaffected, supporting the sensitization model. Contrary to predictions, neither worry, interpersonal sensitivity nor anxiety was associated with harmful intent attributions. In a third exploratory internal meta-analysis, we combined datasets to examine the effect of paranoia on trial-by-trial attributional changes when playing fair and unfair dictators. Paranoia was associated with a greater reduction in harmful intent attributions when playing a fair but not unfair dictator, suggesting that paranoia may also exaggerate the volatility of beliefs about the harmful intent of others.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Interpersonal sensitivity", "Paranoia", "Psychosis", "Social inference"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083299058", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56764022200": {"Name": "Barnby J.M.", "AuthorID": "56764022200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social and Cultural Neuroscience Research Group, Centre for Neuroimaging Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7007065687": {"Name": "Bell V.", "AuthorID": "7007065687", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational, and Healthy Psychology, University College London"}, "7203023363": {"Name": "Mehta M.A.", "AuthorID": "7203023363", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social and Cultural Neuroscience Research Group, Centre for Neuroimaging Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "15126634100": {"Name": "Deeley Q.", "AuthorID": "15126634100", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social and Cultural Neuroscience Research Group, Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "57217621021": {"Name": "Robinson O.", "AuthorID": "57217621021", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60109771", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, Educational, and Healthy Psychology, University College London"}, "22954006700": {"Name": "Raihani N.", "AuthorID": "22954006700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Psychology and Language Sciences, Educational, and Healthy Psychology, University College London"}}}
