Design Data linkage between a longitudinal birth cohort and routinely collected electronic health records. Setting Consenting Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) participants residing in Wales and Scotland. Patients 3119 children who participated in the age 5 MCS interview. Main outcome measures Children with parent-reported SDQ scores were linked with hospital admission and Accident & Emergency (A&E) department records for injuries between ages 9 and 14 years. Negative binomial regression models adjusting for number of people in the household, lone parent, residential area, household poverty, maternal age and academic qualification, child sex, physical activity level and country of interview were fitted in the models. Results 46% of children attended A&E or were admitted to hospital for injury, and 11% had high/abnormal scores for hyperactivity and CP. High/abnormal or borderline hyperactivity were not significantly associated with risk of injury, incidence rate ratio (IRR) with 95% CI of the high/abnormal and borderline were 0.92 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.14) and 1.16 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.52), respectively. Children with borderline CP had higher injury rates compared with those without CP (IRR 1.31, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.57). Conclusions Children with high/abnormal hyperactivity or CP scores were not at increased risk of injury; however, those with borderline CP had higher injury rates. Further research is needed to understand if those with difficulties receive treatment and support, which may reduce the likelihood of injuries.", "AuthorKeywords": ["A&E attendance", "hospital admission", "longitudinal data linkage", "routine data", "Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Age Factors", "Child", "Child Behavior Disorders", "Child, Preschool", "Emergency Service, Hospital", "Female", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Prospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "United Kingdom", "Wounds and Injuries"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074469053", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"56428539800": {"Name": "Bandyopadhyay A.", "AuthorID": "56428539800", "AffiliationID": "60170471", "AffiliationName": "Administrative Data Research UK, Swansea University Medical School"}, "55259733900": {"Name": "Lyons R.A.", "AuthorID": "55259733900", "AffiliationID": "60170471", "AffiliationName": "Health Data Research UK, Swansea University Medical School"}, "56607918500": {"Name": "Brophy S.", "AuthorID": "56607918500", "AffiliationID": "60170471", "AffiliationName": "Health Data Research UK, Swansea University Medical School"}, "35797996000": {"Name": "Akbari A.", "AuthorID": "35797996000", "AffiliationID": "60170471", "AffiliationName": "Health Data Research UK, Swansea University Medical School"}, "56659379500": {"Name": "Tingay K.", "AuthorID": "56659379500", "AffiliationID": "105146134", "AffiliationName": "Office for National Statistics"}, "10139414100": {"Name": "Griffiths L.", "AuthorID": "10139414100", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Life Course Epidemiology and Biostatistics, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, UCL"}, "7004859466": {"Name": "Bedford H.", "AuthorID": "7004859466", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Life Course Epidemiology and Biostatistics, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, UCL"}, "12242685300": {"Name": "Walton S.", "AuthorID": "12242685300", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Life Course Epidemiology and Biostatistics, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, UCL"}, "26643625100": {"Name": "Cortina-Borja M.", "AuthorID": "26643625100", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Nutrition and Biostatistics, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57210230069": {"Name": "Dezateux C.", "AuthorID": "57210230069", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
