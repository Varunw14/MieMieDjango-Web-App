Throughmodulating immune responses and via crosstalk with surrounding renal cells, lymphatic vessels have been implicated in the progression and maintenance of kidney disease. In this Review, we provide an overview of the development, structure, and function of lymphatic vessels in the healthy adult kidney. We then highlight the contributions of lymphatic vessels to multiple forms of renal pathology, emphasizing CKD, transplant rejection, and polycystic kidney disease and discuss strategies to target renal lymphatics using genetic and pharmacologic approaches. Overall, we argue the case for lymphatics playing a fundamental role in renal physiology and pathology and treatments modulating these vessels having therapeutic potential across the spectrum of kidney disease.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptive Immunity", "Graft Rejection", "Humans", "Kidney Diseases", "Kidney Transplantation", "Lymph", "Lymphangiogenesis", "Lymphatic Vessels", "Polycystic Kidney Diseases", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085714363", "SubjectAreas": [["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"57105508100": {"Name": "Jafree D.J.", "AuthorID": "57105508100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medical Sciences, University College London"}, "26643015300": {"Name": "Long D.A.", "AuthorID": "26643015300", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
