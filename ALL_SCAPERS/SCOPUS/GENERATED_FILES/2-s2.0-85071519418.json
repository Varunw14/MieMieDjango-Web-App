We hypothesised that serial and dynamic measures of cardiac vagal activity are also associated with myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery. Methods: Serial autonomic measurements were made before and after surgery in patients undergoing elective noncardiac surgery. Cardiac vagal activity was quantified by HR variability and HR recovery after orthostatic challenge (supine to sitting). Revised cardiac risk index (RCRI) was calculated for each patient. The primary outcome was myocardial injury (high-sensitivity troponin \u226515 ng L\u22121) within 48 h of surgery, masked to investigators. The exposure of interest was cardiac vagal activity (high-frequency power spectral analysis [HFLn]) and HR recovery 90 s from peak HR after the orthostatic challenge. Results: Myocardial injury occurred in 48/189 (25%) patients, in whom 41/48 (85%) RCRI was <2. In patients with myocardial injury, vagal activity (HFLn) declined from 5.15 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.58\u20135.72) before surgery to 4.33 (95% CI: 3.76\u20134.90; P<0.001) 24 h after surgery. In patients who remained free of myocardial injury, HFLn did not change (4.95 [95% CI: 4.64\u20135.26] before surgery vs 4.76 [95% CI: 4.44\u20135.08] after surgery). Before and after surgery, the orthostatic HR recovery was slower in patients with myocardial injury (5 beats min\u22121 [95% CI: 3\u20137]), compared with HR recovery in patients who remained free of myocardial injury (10 beats min\u22121 [95% CI: 7\u201312]; P=0.02). Conclusions: Serial HR measures indicating loss of cardiac vagal activity are associated with perioperative myocardial injury in lower-risk patients undergoing noncardiac surgery.", "AuthorKeywords": ["autonomic nervous system", "cardiac vagal activity", "noncardiac surgery", "perioperative myocardial injury", "perioperative period", "postoperative complications"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Heart Rate", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Myocardial Infarction", "Myocardial Ischemia", "Postoperative Complications", "Prospective Studies", "Surgical Procedures, Operative", "Vagus Nerve"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071519418", "SubjectAreas": [["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"57210569568": {"Name": "May S.M.", "AuthorID": "57210569568", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Translational Medicine and Therapeutics, William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57210577680": {"Name": "Reynolds J.", "AuthorID": "57210577680", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Translational Medicine and Therapeutics, William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "35078845300": {"Name": "Karmali S.", "AuthorID": "35078845300", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Translational Medicine and Therapeutics, William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "8768192800": {"Name": "Ackland G.L.", "AuthorID": "8768192800", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Translational Medicine and Therapeutics, William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "56057407300": {"Name": "Reyes A.", "AuthorID": "56057407300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London NHS Hospitals Trust"}, "57210813057": {"Name": "Martir G.", "AuthorID": "57210813057", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London NHS Hospitals Trust"}, "56056576800": {"Name": "Paredes L.G.", "AuthorID": "56056576800", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London NHS Hospitals Trust"}, "7401884627": {"Name": "Stephens R.C.M.", "AuthorID": "7401884627", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London NHS Hospitals Trust"}, "6603308208": {"Name": "Brealey D.", "AuthorID": "6603308208", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London NHS Hospitals Trust"}}}
