This article examines the controversy around the predominant status of College English and the resulting adjustments that have been made in a new English education policy \u2013 Guidelines on College English Teaching (GCET) \u2013 in 2017, and categorizes the relevant stakeholders into five groups from macro to micro levels and examines their agency roles through investigating their attitudes, interpretations and reactions towards the change in the status of College English in the GCET. The results show that multiple layers of individuals have been endowed with disproportionate powers in status planning. Compared with English teachers and people with expertise, people with influence in society and university administrators constitute the more powerful forces in effecting language policy making.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CECR", "GCET", "individual agency", "language education policy", "Status of College English in China"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076443038", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"57212316728": {"Name": "Cheng J.", "AuthorID": "57212316728", "AffiliationID": "60088567", "AffiliationName": "Foreign Studies, Beijing Information Science and Technology University"}, "57211024132": {"Name": "Wei L.", "AuthorID": "57211024132", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
