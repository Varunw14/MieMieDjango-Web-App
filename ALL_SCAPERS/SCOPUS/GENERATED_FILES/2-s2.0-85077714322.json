For this reason, renal cells have a high density of mitochondria. Mitochondrial cytopathies can be the result of a mutation in both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. Mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to a variety of renal manifestations. Examples of tubular manifestations are renal Fanconi Syndrome, which is often found in patients diagnosed with Kearns-Sayre and Pearson\u2019s marrow-pancreas syndrome, and distal tubulopathies, which result in electrolyte disturbances such as hypomagnesemia. Nephrotic syndrome can be a glomerular manifestation of mitochondrial dysfunction and is typically associated with focal segmental glomerular sclerosis on histology. Tubulointerstitial nephritis can also be seen in mitochondrial cytopathies and may lead to end-stage renal disease. The underlying mechanisms of these cytopathies remain incompletely understood; therefore, current therapies focus mainly on symptom relief. A better understanding of the molecular disease mechanisms is critical in order to improve treatments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Distal tubulopathies", "Mitochondrial DNA", "Nephrotic syndrome", "Renal disease", "Renal Fanconi syndrome", "Tubulointerstitial nephritis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077714322", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"57220260689": {"Name": "Govers L.P.", "AuthorID": "57220260689", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Renal Medicine, University College London"}, "24588277800": {"Name": "Walsh S.B.", "AuthorID": "24588277800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Renal Medicine, University College London"}, "6602980434": {"Name": "Bockenhauer D.", "AuthorID": "6602980434", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Renal Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6602752206": {"Name": "Toka H.R.", "AuthorID": "6602752206", "AffiliationID": "113147306", "AffiliationName": "Manatee Kidney Diseases Consultants"}, "35885580400": {"Name": "Hariri A.", "AuthorID": "35885580400", "AffiliationID": "120310751", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Development, Sanofi Rare Disease"}}}
