Contact-mediated lateral inhibition is well known to play an important role in determining cell fate decisions in the nervous system by either regulating tissue boundary formation or the classical salt-and-pepper pattern of differentiation that results from direct neighboring cell contacts. In many systems, however, such as the Drosophila notum, Drosophila wing, zebrafish pigmented cells, and zebrafish spinal cord, the differentiation pattern occurs at multiple-cell diameter distances. In this review, we discuss the evidence and characteristics of long-distance patterning mechanisms mediated by cellular protrusions. In the nervous system, cellular protrusions deliver the Notch ligand Delta at long range to prevent cells from differentiating in their vicinity. By temporal control of protrusive activity, this mechanism can pattern differentiation in both space and time.", "AuthorKeywords": ["long distance signaling", "nervous system", "neurogenesis", "neuronal patterning", "neuronal spacing", "protrusion mediated signaling"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092487483", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57199008759": {"Name": "Moore R.E.", "AuthorID": "57199008759", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Developmental Neurobiology, King\u2019s College London"}, "7403197213": {"Name": "Clarke J.", "AuthorID": "7403197213", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Developmental Neurobiology, King\u2019s College London"}, "14324228500": {"Name": "Alexandre P.", "AuthorID": "14324228500", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer, UCL GOS Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
