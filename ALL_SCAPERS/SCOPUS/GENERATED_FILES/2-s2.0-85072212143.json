Methods: sPDGFR\u03b2 and albumin were measured by sandwich ELISA in ante-mortem CSF from 39 AD and 39 age-matched controls that were grouped according to their biomarker profile (i.e. AD cases t-tau > 400 pg/mL, p-tau > 60 pg/mL and A\u03b242 < 550 pg/mL). sPDGFR\u03b2 was also measured in matched serum and CSF samples (n = 23) in a separate neurologically normal group for which the CSF/serum albumin ratio had been determined. Results: CSF sPDGFR\u03b2 level was significantly increased in AD (p = 0.0038) and correlated positively with albumin (r = 0.45, p = 0.007), total tau (r = 0.50, p = 0.0017) and phosphorylated tau (r = 0.41, p = 0.013) in AD but not in controls. CSF sPDGFR\u03b2 did not correlate with A\u03b242. Serum and CSF sPDGFR\u03b2 were positively correlated (r = 0.547, p = 0.0085) in the independent neurologically normal CSF/serum matched samples. Conclusions: We provide further evidence of an association between pericyte injury and BBB breakdown in AD and novel evidence that a CSF marker of pericyte injury is related to the severity of AD pathology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Cerebrospinal fluid", "CSF", "CSF albumin", "PDGFR\u03b2", "Platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Albumins", "Alzheimer Disease", "Biomarkers", "Blood-Brain Barrier", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pericytes", "Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072212143", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"14829181000": {"Name": "Miners J.S.", "AuthorID": "14829181000", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650, 60016447", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Group, Clinical Neurosciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Learning and Research Building, Southmead Hospital"}, "7006249660": {"Name": "Kehoe P.G.", "AuthorID": "7006249660", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650, 60016447", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Group, Clinical Neurosciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Learning and Research Building, Southmead Hospital"}, "55629821400": {"Name": "Love S.", "AuthorID": "55629821400", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650, 60016447", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Group, Clinical Neurosciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Learning and Research Building, Southmead Hospital"}, "57208899083": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "57208899083", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL"}, "7101909602": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "7101909602", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}}}
