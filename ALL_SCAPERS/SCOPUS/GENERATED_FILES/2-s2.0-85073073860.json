Erbium-doped fibre amplifiers (EDFAs) and Raman amplifiers have made it possible to extend the usable fibre bandwidth to increase the achievable capacity of optical communications in past decades to meet the ever-growing information rate demands. However, these amplification technologies are now viewed as limiting the accessible optical spectrum to \u223c5 THz and \u223c10 - 15 THz, respectively. Currently, the presence of Kerr effects in fibre channels has been largely regarded as the major bottleneck for enhancing achievable information rates of optical communications. Signal performance degradations due to fibre nonlinearities are more severe in the systems utilising larger transmission bandwidths, closer channel spacing and higher-order modulation formats. In this work, we will study the impact and compensation of Kerr effects to analyse the performance of long-haul optical fibre communication systems using EDFAs and Raman amplifiers. Achievable information rates of such ultra-wideband optical transmission systems will be discussed considering nonlinearity compensation and probabilistic shaping techniques.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Achievable information rate", "Erbium-doped fibre amplifiers", "Kerr fibre nonlinearity", "Optical fibre communications", "Probabilistic shaping", "Raman amplifiers"], "IndexKeywords": ["Achievable information rate", "Communication infrastructure", "Higher order modulation formats", "Kerr fibre nonlinearity", "Non-linearity compensation", "Optical transmission systems", "Probabilistic shaping", "Raman amplifier"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073073860", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"]], "AuthorData": {"7401627190": {"Name": "Xu T.", "AuthorID": "7401627190", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL)"}, "7405910538": {"Name": "Liu T.", "AuthorID": "7405910538", "AffiliationID": "60019533", "AffiliationName": "Tianjin University"}, "57090027300": {"Name": "Shevchenko N.A.", "AuthorID": "57090027300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London (KCL)"}, "7005053644": {"Name": "Bayvel P.", "AuthorID": "7005053644", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL)"}, "56703765300": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "56703765300", "AffiliationID": "109078231", "AffiliationName": "Finisar Corporation"}}}
