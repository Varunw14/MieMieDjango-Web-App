International Journal of Gynecology & Obstetrics published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of International Federation of Gynecology and ObstetricsObjective: To assess how mothers are feeling and coping during lockdown, and to identify the potential pathways that can assist them. Methods: A descriptive analysis of maternal mental health, coping, support, activities, lockdown consequences was conducted. Women living in the UK with an infant aged \u226412 months completed an online survey. Linear regression was used to identify predictors of maternal mental health and coping. Results: A majority of the 1329 participants reported feeling down (56%), lonely (59%), irritable (62%), and worried (71%) to some extent since lockdown began, but 70% felt able to cope. Support with her own health (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.004\u20130.235), contacting infant support groups (95% CI \u22120.003 to 0.252), and higher gestational age of the infant (95% CI 0.000\u20130.063) predicted better mental health. Travelling for work (95% CI \u22120.680 to \u22120.121), the impact of lockdown on the ability to afford food (95% CI \u22121.202 to \u22120.177), and having an income <\u00a330 000 (95% CI \u22120.475 to \u22120.042) predicted poorer mental health. Support with her own health and more equal division of household chores were associated with better coping. Conclusion: There is a need to assess maternal mental health and identify prevention strategies for mothers during lockdown.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coping", "Coronavirus", "COVID-19", "Maternal health", "Mental health", "Postpartum"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Psychological", "Adult", "COVID-19", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Loneliness", "Male", "Maternal Health", "Mental Health", "Mothers", "Pandemics", "Quarantine", "SARS-CoV-2", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092589083", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"57216309553": {"Name": "Dib S.", "AuthorID": "57216309553", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "55961413000": {"Name": "Rougeaux E.", "AuthorID": "55961413000", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "55645585200": {"Name": "V\u00e1zquez-V\u00e1zquez A.", "AuthorID": "55645585200", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "55603815000": {"Name": "Wells J.C.K.", "AuthorID": "55603815000", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7004016103": {"Name": "Fewtrell M.", "AuthorID": "7004016103", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}}}
