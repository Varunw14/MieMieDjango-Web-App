We aimed to evaluate the local control, toxicity, and survival outcomes in a cohort of patients previously treated with neoadjuvant pelvic radiation therapy for nonmetastatic locally recurrent rectal cancer, now treated with SBRT. Methods and Materials: Inoperable rectal cancer patients with \u22643 sites of pelvic recurrence and >6 months since prior pelvic radiation therapy were identified from a prospective registry over 4 years. SBRT dose was 30 Gy in 5 fractions, daily or alternate days, using cumulative organ at risk dose constraints. Primary outcome was local control (LC). Secondary outcomes were progression free survival, overall survival, toxicity, and patient reported quality of life scores using the EQ visual analog scale (EQ-VAS) tool. Results: Thirty patients (35 targets) were included. Median gross tumor volume size was 14.3 cm3. In addition, 27 of 30 (90%) previously received 45 to 50.4 Gy in 25 of 28 fractions, with 10% receiving an alternative prescription. All patients received the planned reirradiation SBRT dose. The median follow-up was 24.5 months (interquartile range, 17.8-28.8). The 1-year LC was 84.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 70.6-99) and a 2-year LC was 69% (95% CI, 51.8-91.9). The median progression free survival was 12.1 months (95% CI, 8.6-17.66), and median overall survival was 28.3 months (95% CI, 17.88-39.5 months). No patient experienced >G2 acute toxicity and only 1 patient experienced late G3 toxicity. Patient-reported QoL outcomes were improved at 3 months after SBRT (\u0394 EQ-VAS, +10 points, Wilcoxon signed-rank, P =.009). Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that, for small volume pelvic disease relapses from rectal cancer, reirradiation with 30 Gy in 5 fractions is well tolerated and achieves an excellent balance between high local control rates with limited toxicity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090709691", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57218914705": {"Name": "Smith T.", "AuthorID": "57218914705", "AffiliationID": "60006776", "AffiliationName": "Mount Vernon Cancer Centre, East and North Herefordshire NHS Trust"}, "57218909587": {"Name": "Silverman S.", "AuthorID": "57218909587", "AffiliationID": "60006776", "AffiliationName": "Mount Vernon Cancer Centre, East and North Herefordshire NHS Trust"}, "57208465285": {"Name": "Tsang Y.", "AuthorID": "57208465285", "AffiliationID": "60006776", "AffiliationName": "Mount Vernon Cancer Centre, East and North Herefordshire NHS Trust"}, "36936145400": {"Name": "O'Cathail S.M.", "AuthorID": "36936145400", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow"}, "7401594657": {"Name": "Harrison M.", "AuthorID": "7401594657", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow"}, "57203905198": {"Name": "Robinson M.", "AuthorID": "57203905198", "AffiliationID": "60170323", "AffiliationName": "Oxford University NHS Foundation Trust"}, "9275515900": {"Name": "Hawkins M.A.", "AuthorID": "9275515900", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
