We study offering strategies of a flexible producer in day-ahead and intraday markets using a bi-level model in which the upper level represents the profit-maximization problem of the producer and the lower-level problems clear the day-ahead and intraday markets sequentially. Using a three-node network, we first demonstrate that a flexible producer with perfect forecasts can increase its profit in both markets by coordinating its offer so as to cause transmission grid congestion or lack of competitive generation capacity. Moreover, we show that strategic behavior is possible even when the day-ahead and intraday markets are cleared simultaneously to lower balancing costs. We next assess these market designs in a Nordic test network and offer an explanation for high Nordic intraday prices. Finally, via an annual simulation using the Nordic market data, we verify that strategic offering in day-ahead and intraday markets under imperfect forecasts leads to increased profits vis-\u00e0-vis perfect competition but are mitigated through simultaneous market clearing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Day-ahead market", "Intraday market", "Mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints", "OR in energy", "Strategic offering"], "IndexKeywords": ["Day ahead market", "Imperfect forecasts", "Mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints", "OR in energy", "Perfect competition", "Profit maximization", "Renewable generation", "Strategic offering"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079535437", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Management Science and Operations Research", "DECI", "1803"], ["Information Systems and Management", "DECI", "1802"]], "AuthorData": {"57191823386": {"Name": "Rintam\u00e4ki T.", "AuthorID": "57191823386", "AffiliationID": "60103653", "AffiliationName": "Systems Analysis Laboratory, Department of Mathematics and Systems Analysis, School of Science, Aalto University"}, "7005955017": {"Name": "Salo A.", "AuthorID": "7005955017", "AffiliationID": "60103653", "AffiliationName": "Systems Analysis Laboratory, Department of Mathematics and Systems Analysis, School of Science, Aalto University"}, "7201954788": {"Name": "Siddiqui A.S.", "AuthorID": "7201954788", "AffiliationID": "60002970", "AffiliationName": "Department of Decision Sciences, HEC Montr\u00e9al"}}}
