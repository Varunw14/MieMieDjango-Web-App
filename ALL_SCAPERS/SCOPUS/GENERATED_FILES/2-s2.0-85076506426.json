Patients with BRAF V600 mutation\u2013positive pLGG may benefit from treatment with dabrafenib. Part 2 of a phase I/IIa study, open-label study (NCT01677741) explores the activity and safety of dabrafenib treatment in these patients. Patients and Methods: Patients ages 1 to <18 years who had BRAF V600\u2013mutant solid tumors (\u22651 evaluable lesion) with recurrent, refractory, or progressive disease after \u22651 standard therapy were treated with oral dabrafenib 3.0 to 5.25 mg/kg/ day (part 1) or at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D; part 2). Primary objectives were to determine the RP2D (part 1, results presented in a companion paper) and assess clinical activity (part 2). Here, we report the clinical activity, including objective response rates (ORRs) using Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria and safety across parts 1 and 2. Results: Overall, 32 patients with pLGG were enrolled (part 1, n \u00bc 15; part 2, n \u00bc 17). Minimum follow-up was 26.2 months. Among all patients, the ORR was 44% [95% confidence interval (CI), 26\u201362] by independent review. The 1-year progression-free survival rate was 85% (95% CI, 64\u201394). Treatment-related adverse events (AE) were reported in 29 patients (91%); the most common was fatigue (34%). Grade 3/4 treatment-related AEs were reported in 9 patients (28%). Conclusions: Dabrafenib demonstrated meaningful clinical activity and acceptable tolerability in patients with BRAF V600\u2013mutant pLGG.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076506426", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"57210349888": {"Name": "Hargrave D.R.", "AuthorID": "57210349888", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Oncology Unit, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57203082668": {"Name": "Bouffet E.", "AuthorID": "57203082668", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto"}, "7102828297": {"Name": "Whitlock J.A.", "AuthorID": "7102828297", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto"}, "57203258956": {"Name": "Tabori U.", "AuthorID": "57203258956", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Arthur and Sonia Labatt Brain Tumor Research Center, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto"}, "6602821362": {"Name": "Broniscer A.", "AuthorID": "6602821362", "AffiliationID": "60019905", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital"}, "7102614779": {"Name": "Cohen K.J.", "AuthorID": "7102614779", "AffiliationID": "60021212, 60005248", "AffiliationName": "Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Division of Pediatric Oncology"}, "55258916000": {"Name": "Hansford J.R.", "AuthorID": "55258916000", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60026489, 60009102", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Royal Children's Hospital, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, University of Melbourne"}, "6603067617": {"Name": "Geoerger B.", "AuthorID": "6603067617", "AffiliationID": "60106017, 60106080", "AffiliationName": "Department of Childhood and Adolescent Oncology, Gustave Roussy Cancer Center, Universite Paris-Saclay"}, "24172374300": {"Name": "Hingorani P.", "AuthorID": "24172374300", "AffiliationID": "60007421", "AffiliationName": "Phoenix Children's Hospital, Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders"}, "7004912949": {"Name": "Dunkel I.J.", "AuthorID": "7004912949", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"}, "57200895313": {"Name": "Russo M.W.", "AuthorID": "57200895313", "AffiliationID": "60009968", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation"}, "57212371543": {"Name": "Tseng L.", "AuthorID": "57212371543", "AffiliationID": "60009968", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation"}, "56358019700": {"Name": "Gasal E.", "AuthorID": "56358019700", "AffiliationID": "60009968", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation"}, "57204975305": {"Name": "Dasgupta K.", "AuthorID": "57204975305", "AffiliationID": "117724232", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Healthcare Pvt.
