The aim of the project was to explore the effects of making pedagogy more visible on students\u2019 success in school mathematics. We adopted a Participatory Action Research methodology to plan and evaluate five strategies used alongside \u2018progressive\u2019 teaching approaches to make the teacher\u2019s pedagogical rationale more visible to learners. Our findings show that students, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, were initially prone to misinterpret the intentions of the teacher. However, the five strategies helped students gain a greater appreciation of the teacher\u2019s pedagogical rationale and how to respond appropriately. We discuss the implications of these findings for enabling all students to access the benefits of progressive teaching approaches and for opening up to scrutiny what it means to be a successful learner of mathematics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["inequity in mathematics education", "participatory action research", "Visible mathematics pedagogy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086855659", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (miscellaneous)", "MATH", "2601"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"55457522400": {"Name": "Wright P.", "AuthorID": "55457522400", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "57217230378": {"Name": "Fejzo A.", "AuthorID": "57217230378", "AffiliationID": "100694315", "AffiliationName": "Stoke Newington School"}, "57217238046": {"Name": "Carvalho T.", "AuthorID": "57217238046", "AffiliationID": "100694315", "AffiliationName": "Stoke Newington School"}}}
