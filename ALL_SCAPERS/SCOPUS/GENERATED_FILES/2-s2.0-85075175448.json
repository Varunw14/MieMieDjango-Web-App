In this narrative review, we draw from innovation and health systems literature and thinking to trace and analyse the deployment and uptake of innovative point-of-care testing in the early infant diagnosis of HIV in Zimbabwe, one of 15 UNITAID supported early adopter countries. Following a literature review and discussions with policy-makers in Zimbabwe, we distil key lessons from this implementation context and delineate the implications of our findings for the debates on new technological and socio-economic approaches and the health systems strengthening agenda in low-middle income countries (LMICs). We conclude this article by proposing new avenues for future research.", "AuthorKeywords": ["health systems strengthening", "HIV point of care testing", "integration", "knowledge flows", "Zimbabwe"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075175448", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Development", "SOCI", "3303"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"55378111100": {"Name": "Ncube V.", "AuthorID": "55378111100", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Science Policy Research Unit, University of Sussex"}, "35568915100": {"Name": "Chataway J.", "AuthorID": "35568915100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Science, Technology, Engineering and Public Policy (STEaPP), University College London (UCL)"}}}
