MATERIALS and METHODS: A standard protocol of translation was followed for psychometric instruments. A total of 108 patients (75.9% women), mean age 51.9 years, with peripheral or central dizziness and vertigo participated in our cross-sectional study. The internal consistency was measured by Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient and corrected item-total correlations (CI-TCs). After a week, 65 of the recruited patients were again asked to fill out Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI)-L to ascertain test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation, ICC). Concurrent validation was performed using Pearson correlation between the total score and subscales of DHI-L and the eight scales of Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36). Finally, the factor structure of the DHI was assessed by principal component analysis (PCA). RESULTS: The Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient was very high (0.91). CI-TCs for DHI-L total scale ranged from 0.33 to 0.67. The correlations between DHI and SF-36 were high to weak. The ICC was excellent for the total score and its subscales. Our proposed two-factor model explained 44.5% of the variance. The first factor indicated disability in daily activities and psychological effect of handicap. The second factor comprised of items that pertained to postural instability. CONCLUSION: The DHI-L has shown good reliability and validity. Results did not support the original subscale structure of the DHI. As more studies need to be done to restructure DHI, we recommend only using the total DHI score as a measure of dizziness handicap.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dizziness", "Factor analysis", "Quality of life"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cross-Sectional Studies", "Disability Evaluation", "Dizziness", "Factor Analysis, Statistical", "Female", "Humans", "Lithuania", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Psychometrics", "Reproducibility of Results", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Translations", "Vertigo"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076831277", "SubjectAreas": [["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"]], "AuthorData": {"57205667891": {"Name": "Valan\u010dius D.", "AuthorID": "57205667891", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Vilnius University School of Medicine"}, "57060554600": {"Name": "Ulyt\u0117 A.", "AuthorID": "57060554600", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Clinic of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Vilnius University School of Medicine, Institute of Clinical Medicine"}, "57192987771": {"Name": "Masili\u016bnas R.", "AuthorID": "57192987771", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Clinic of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Vilnius University School of Medicine, Institute of Clinical Medicine"}, "14062034800": {"Name": "Jatu\u017eis D.", "AuthorID": "14062034800", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Clinic of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Vilnius University School of Medicine, Institute of Clinical Medicine"}, "57094136500": {"Name": "Ryli\u0161kien\u0117 K.", "AuthorID": "57094136500", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Clinic of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Vilnius University School of Medicine, Institute of Clinical Medicine"}, "57205668539": {"Name": "Pa\u0161konien\u0117 A.", "AuthorID": "57205668539", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Clinic of Ear, Nose, Throat, and Eye Diseases, Vilnius University School of Medicine, Institute of Clinical Medicine"}, "6508241824": {"Name": "Lesinskas E.", "AuthorID": "6508241824", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Clinic of Ear, Nose, Throat, and Eye Diseases, Vilnius University School of Medicine, Institute of Clinical Medicine"}, "8591572500": {"Name": "Ulozien\u0117 I.", "AuthorID": "8591572500", "AffiliationID": "60109642", "AffiliationName": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Medical Academy"}, "57196072362": {"Name": "Vaicekauskien\u0117 L.", "AuthorID": "57196072362", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Institute for the Languages and Cultures of the Baltic, Vilnius University"}, "6507711283": {"Name": "Kaski D.", "AuthorID": "6507711283", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Motor Neuroscience"}}}
