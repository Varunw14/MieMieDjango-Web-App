All rights reserved.Are business cycles mainly a response to persistent exogenous shocks, or do they instead reflect a strong endogenous mechanism which produces recurrent boom-bust phenomena?

The elements that tend to favor this type of interpretation of business cycles are (i) slightly extending the frequency window one associates with business cycle phenomena, (ii) allowing for strategic complementarities across agents that arise due to financial frictions, and (iii) allowing for a locally unstable steady state in estimation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078839273", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"7005376779": {"Name": "Beaudry P.", "AuthorID": "7005376779", "AffiliationID": "60027607", "AffiliationName": "Bank of Canada"}, "57220336583": {"Name": "Galizia D.", "AuthorID": "57220336583", "AffiliationID": "60017592", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, Carleton University"}, "56188154900": {"Name": "Portier F.", "AuthorID": "56188154900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016621", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University College London, Center for Economic Policy Research"}}}
