Using self-reported data from 24,882 adults (Health Survey for England 2008, 2012, 2016), we examined gender-specific inequalities in these separate aspects for total and domain-specific MVPA. Methods: Hurdle models accommodate continuous data with excess zeros and positive skewness. Such models were used to assess differences between income groups in three aspects: (1) the probability of doing any MVPA, (2) the average hours/week spent in MVPA, and (3) the average hours/week spent in MVPA conditional on participation (MVPA-active). Inequalities were summarised on the absolute scale using average marginal effects (AMEs) after confounder adjustment. Results: Inequalities were robust to adjustment in each aspect for total MVPA and for sports/exercise. Differences between adults in high-income versus low-income households in sports/exercise MVPA were 2.2 h/week among men (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.6, 2.8) and 1.7 h/week among women (95% CI: 1.3, 2.1); differences in sports/exercise MVPA-active were 1.3 h/week (95% CI: 0.4, 2.1) and 1.0 h/week (95% CI: 0.5, 1.6) for men and women, respectively. Heterogeneity in associations was evident for the other domains. For example, adults in high-income versus low-income households were more likely to do any walking (men: 13.0% (95% CI: 10.3, 15.8%); women: 10.2% (95% CI: 7.6, 12.8%)). Among all adults (including those who did no walking), the average hours/week spent walking showed no difference by income. Among those who did any walking, adults in high-income versus low-income households walked on average 1 h/week less (men: - 0.9 h/week (95% CI: - 1.7, - 0.2); women: - 1.0 h/week (95% CI: - 1.7, - 0.2)). Conclusions: Participation and the amount of time that adults spend in MVPA typically favours those in high-income households. Monitoring inequalities in MVPA requires assessing different aspects of the distribution within each domain. Reducing inequalities in sports/exercise requires policy actions and interventions to move adults in low-income households from inactivity to activity, and to enable those already active to do more. Measures to promote walking should focus efforts on reducing the sizeable income gap in the propensity to do any walking.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hurdle models", "Inequalities", "Moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity", "Physical activity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "England", "Exercise", "Female", "Health Surveys", "Humans", "Income", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Models, Statistical", "Sports", "Time Factors", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082039772", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"35363010600": {"Name": "Scholes S.", "AuthorID": "35363010600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7005836049": {"Name": "Mindell J.S.", "AuthorID": "7005836049", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
