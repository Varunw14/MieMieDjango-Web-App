However, to date, most studies of the DRS have been done in clinical samples. Little is known about its psychometric properties in nonclinical samples. This study examined linear and potential categorical relationships of DRS with demographic features and with indices of intrapersonal and interpersonal functioning (i.e., depressive and dissociative symptoms, dependent and self-critical personality features, and warmth, conflict, and depth of intimate relationships), in a nonclinical sample of young adults (N = 333). It also investigated the unidimensionality of the DRS in the relationships between the level of self-representation (DR-S) and representation of the mother (DR-M) and father (DR-F), and the relationship of DR-S with disruptions in the balance between differentiation and relatedness assumed to underlie low levels of DR-S. Results showed little evidence for dimensional relationships between levels of DRS and indices of intrapersonal and interpersonal functioning. By contrast, a cut-off of DRS level 6 clearly differentiated young adults at risk for psychopathology from those with more adaptive levels of functioning. Moreover, the DRS seems not to be a unidimensional scale. The implications of these findings for future research and the clinical use of the DRS are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Differentiation-Relatedness scale", "Interpersonal functioning", "Level of personality functioning", "Psychopathology", "Young adults"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082764142", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"56586243300": {"Name": "Beheydt L.L.", "AuthorID": "56586243300", "AffiliationID": "60012937, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "University of Antwerp, Department of Behaviour, Health and Psychopathology, Catholic University of Leuven"}, "57188958610": {"Name": "Van Liefferinge D.", "AuthorID": "57188958610", "AffiliationID": "60031069, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "University Psychiatric Centre, Departments of Behaviour, Health and Psychopathology and Neurosciences, Catholic University of Leuven"}, "6505845650": {"Name": "Lowyck B.", "AuthorID": "6505845650", "AffiliationID": "60031069, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "University Psychiatric Centre, Departments of Behaviour, Health and Psychopathology and Neurosciences, Catholic University of Leuven"}, "23052372400": {"Name": "Schrijvers D.", "AuthorID": "23052372400", "AffiliationID": "60012937", "AffiliationName": "University Psychiatric Centre Duffel, Collaborative Antwerp Psychiatric Research Institute (CAPRI), University of Antwerp"}, "7003400751": {"Name": "Sabbe B.", "AuthorID": "7003400751", "AffiliationID": "60012937", "AffiliationName": "University Psychiatric Centre Duffel, Collaborative Antwerp Psychiatric Research Institute (CAPRI), University of Antwerp"}, "57203069499": {"Name": "Luyten P.", "AuthorID": "57203069499", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}}}
