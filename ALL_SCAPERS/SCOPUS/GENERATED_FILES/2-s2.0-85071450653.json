Here, we investigate whether pharmacological manipulation of the stress granule pathway in the auditory organ, the cochlea, affects the survival of sensory hair cells during aminoglycoside ototoxicity, a common cause of acquired hearing loss. We show that hydroxamate (-)-9, a silvestrol analogue that inhibits eIF4A, induces stress granule formation in both an auditory cell line and ex-vivo cochlear cultures and that it prevents ototoxin-induced hair-cell death. In contrast, preventing stress granule formation using the small molecule inhibitor ISRIB increases hair-cell death. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence of stress granule formation in mammalian hair cells in-vivo triggered by aminoglycoside treatment. Our results demonstrate that pharmacological induction of stress granules enhances cell survival in native-tissue, in a clinically-relevant context. This establishes stress granules as a viable therapeutic target not only for hearing loss but also other neurodegenerative diseases.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aminoglycosides", "Animals", "Cochlea", "Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4F", "Hair Cells, Auditory", "Hearing Loss", "Humans", "Mice", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "Ototoxicity", "Stress, Physiological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071450653", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55446186300": {"Name": "Gon\u00e7alves A.C.", "AuthorID": "55446186300", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Ear Institute, University College London"}, "8666471500": {"Name": "Towers E.R.", "AuthorID": "8666471500", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Ear Institute, University College London"}, "57210798158": {"Name": "Haq N.", "AuthorID": "57210798158", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Ear Institute, University College London"}, "7202902185": {"Name": "Dawson S.J.", "AuthorID": "7202902185", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Ear Institute, University College London"}, "7101993331": {"Name": "Gale J.E.", "AuthorID": "7101993331", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Ear Institute, University College London"}, "7004535923": {"Name": "Porco J.A.", "AuthorID": "7004535923", "AffiliationID": "60019674", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Center for Molecular Discovery, Boston University"}, "57202478711": {"Name": "Pelletier J.", "AuthorID": "57202478711", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, McGill University"}}}
