Testing for resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors and PIs is well established in routine care. However, testing for integrase strand transfer inhibitor (InSTI) resistance is less consistent. Objectives: To inform treatment guidelines by determining the prevalence of InSTI resistance in a national cohort of recently infected individuals. Patients and methods: Recent (within 4 months) HIV-1 infections were identified using a Recent Infection Testing Algorithm of new HIV-1 diagnoses in the UK. Resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) in integrase, protease and reverse transcriptase were detected by ultradeep sequencing, which allows for the sensitive estimation of the frequency of each resistant variant in a sample. Results: The analysis included 655 randomly selected individuals (median age = 33 years, 95% male, 83% MSM, 78% white) sampled in the period 2014 to 2016 and determined to have a recent infection. These comprised 320, 138 and 197 samples from 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. None of the samples had major InSTI RAMs occurring at high variant frequency (\u226520%). A subset (25/640, 3.9%) had major InSTI RAMs occurring only as low-frequency variants (2%\u201320%). In contrast, 47/588 (8.0%) had major reverse transcriptase inhibitor and PI RAMs at high frequency. Conclusions: Between 2014 and 2016, major InSTI RAMs were uncommon in adults with recent HIV-1 infection, only occurring as low-frequency variants of doubtful clinical significance. Continued surveillance of newly diagnosed patients for evidence of transmitted InSTI resistance is recommended to inform clinical practice.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85093538806", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"6506370126": {"Name": "Mbisa J.L.", "AuthorID": "6506370126", "AffiliationID": "60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Health Protection Research Unit in Blood Borne, Sexually Transmitted Infections"}, "57207772899": {"Name": "Ledesma J.", "AuthorID": "57207772899", "AffiliationID": "60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Health Protection Research Unit in Blood Borne, Sexually Transmitted Infections"}, "56992818500": {"Name": "Kirwan P.", "AuthorID": "56992818500", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "8614970600": {"Name": "Bibby D.F.", "AuthorID": "8614970600", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "35774571400": {"Name": "Manso C.", "AuthorID": "35774571400", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "55522833900": {"Name": "Skingsley A.", "AuthorID": "55522833900", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "55415921900": {"Name": "Murphy G.", "AuthorID": "55415921900", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "36190408300": {"Name": "Brown A.", "AuthorID": "36190408300", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "10440140300": {"Name": "Delpech V.", "AuthorID": "10440140300", "AffiliationID": "60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Health Protection Research Unit in Blood Borne, Sexually Transmitted Infections"}, "56595739700": {"Name": "Dunn D.T.", "AuthorID": "56595739700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "6701366859": {"Name": "Geretti A.M.", "AuthorID": "6701366859", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool"}}}
