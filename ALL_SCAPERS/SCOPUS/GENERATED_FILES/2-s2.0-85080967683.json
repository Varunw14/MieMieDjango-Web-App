Previous studies have found some evidence of goal-directed deficits when healthy individuals are stressed, and in psychiatric conditions characterised by compulsive behaviours and anxiety. Here, we tested if goal-directed control is affected by state anxiety, which might explain the former results.MethodsWe carried out a causal test of this hypothesis in two experiments (between-subject N = 88; within-subject N = 50) that used the inhalation of hypercapnic gas (7.5% CO2) to induce an acute state of anxiety in healthy volunteers. In a third experiment (N = 1413), we used a correlational design to test if real-life anxiety-provoking events (panic attacks, stressful events) are associated with impaired goal-directed control.ResultsIn the former two causal experiments, we induced a profoundly anxious state, both physiologically and psychologically, but this did not affect goal-directed performance. In the third, correlational, study, we found no evidence for an association between goal-directed control, panic attacks or stressful life eventsover and above variance accounted for by trait differences in compulsivity.ConclusionsIn sum, three complementary experiments found no evidence that anxiety impairs goal-directed control in human subjects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anxiety", "Goal-directed control", "Obsessive-compulsive disorder"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85080967683", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"50161540900": {"Name": "Gillan C.M.", "AuthorID": "50161540900", "AffiliationID": "60021784", "AffiliationName": "New York University"}, "55551290500": {"Name": "Vaghi M.M.", "AuthorID": "55551290500", "AffiliationID": "60122566", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research"}, "57211799930": {"Name": "Hezemans F.H.", "AuthorID": "57211799930", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge"}, "53864063600": {"Name": "Savulich G.", "AuthorID": "53864063600", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge"}, "57211739712": {"Name": "Robbins T.W.", "AuthorID": "57211739712", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge"}, "57204310551": {"Name": "Van Ghesel Grothe S.", "AuthorID": "57204310551", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "University of Amsterdam"}, "57211804427": {"Name": "Dafflon J.", "AuthorID": "57211804427", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Kings College London"}, "6603559196": {"Name": "Br\u00fchl A.B.", "AuthorID": "6603559196", "AffiliationID": "60019619", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital of Psychiatry Zurich"}}}
