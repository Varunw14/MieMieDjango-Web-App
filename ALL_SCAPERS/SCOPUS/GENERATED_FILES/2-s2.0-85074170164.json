Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Studies describing the impact of suicide bereavement report an excess risk of suicide, suicide attempt, psychiatric illness, and drug and alcohol use disorders compared with the general population. However, the nature of patterns of drug and alcohol use after suicide bereavement is unclear. We used an online survey to collect qualitative data to understand whether and how drug and alcohol use changes after suicide bereavement. We conducted thematic analysis of free-text responses to a question capturing their use of alcohol and drugs after the suicide of a family member or a close friend. Analysing data from 346 adults in Britain aged 18\u201340, we identified three main themes describing the relationship of suicide bereavement to alcohol or drug use: (1) control over drug or alcohol use, (2) the perceived purpose of using drugs or alcohol, and (3) the attribution of drug or alcohol misuse to external factors. Overlying these themes were dimensions of control and of awareness of potential harms. This study highlights that increased use of drugs and alcohol after suicide bereavement may form part of a bereaved person\u2019s coping strategies, and that sensitive approaches are needed when judging whether and when to intervene.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alcohol", "Bereavement", "Drug", "Grief", "Qualitative research", "Suicide", "Thematic analysis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074170164", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis", "ENVI", "2307"]], "AuthorData": {"57211482662": {"Name": "Eng J.", "AuthorID": "57211482662", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Division of Psychology and Language Sciences"}, "57211493725": {"Name": "Drabwell L.", "AuthorID": "57211493725", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Behaviour Change, Research Department of Clinical, Educational, and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "7102932453": {"Name": "Stevenson F.", "AuthorID": "7102932453", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Research, Department of Primary Care & Population Health"}, "56591241100": {"Name": "King M.", "AuthorID": "56591241100", "AffiliationID": "60161450, 60161451", "AffiliationName": "Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust, St Pancras Hospital"}, "57189923687": {"Name": "Osborn D.", "AuthorID": "57189923687", "AffiliationID": "60161450, 60161451", "AffiliationName": "Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust, St Pancras Hospital"}, "13103656500": {"Name": "Pitman A.", "AuthorID": "13103656500", "AffiliationID": "60161450, 60161451", "AffiliationName": "Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust, St Pancras Hospital"}}}
