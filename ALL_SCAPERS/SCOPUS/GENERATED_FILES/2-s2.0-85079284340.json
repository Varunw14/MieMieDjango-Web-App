Objective: To examine associations between concurrent multisensory impairments and aspects of well-being and mental health, namely quality of life and depressive symptoms. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional analysis of participants in the English Longitudinal Study of Aging wave 8 (May 2016 to June 2017). This is a representative sample of free-living English individuals 52 years and older. Analysis began April 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Linear and logistic regression models were used to assess the association of self-reported concurrent impairments in hearing, vision, smell, and taste with quality of life (0-57 on the 19-item CASP-19 scale; Control, Autonomy, Self-realization and Pleasure) and depressive symptoms (\u22654 items on the 8-item Centre for Epidemiologic Study Depression Scale). Results: Using a representative sample of 6147 individuals, 52% (weighted) were women (n = 3455; unweighted, 56%) and the mean (95% CI) age was 66.6 (66.2-67.0) years. Multiple sensory impairments were associated with poorer quality of life and greater odds of depressive symptoms after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, chronic conditions, and cognitive function. Compared with no sensory impairment, quality of life decreased linearly as the number of senses impaired increased, with individuals reporting 3 to 4 sensory impairments displaying the poorest quality of life (-4.68; 95% CI, -6.13 to -3.23 points on the CASP-19 scale). Similarly, odds of depressive symptoms increased linearly as the number of impairments increased. Individuals with 3 to 4 senses impaired had more than a 3-fold risk of depressive symptoms (odds ratio, 3.36; 95% CI, 2.28-4.96). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study, concurrent sensory impairments were associated with poorer quality of life and increased risks of depressive symptoms. Therefore, assessing and managing sensory impairments could help improve older adults' well-being..", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Aged", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Depression", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Loneliness", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Quality of Life", "Self Report", "Sensation Disorders"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079284340", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"]], "AuthorData": {"57132532900": {"Name": "Liljas A.E.M.", "AuthorID": "57132532900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "35798512000": {"Name": "Lassale C.", "AuthorID": "35798512000", "AffiliationID": "60023506", "AffiliationName": "Epidemiology and Public Health Program, Hospital Del Mar Medical Research Institute"}, "57216095734": {"Name": "Jones A.", "AuthorID": "57216095734", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "57016564400": {"Name": "Cadar D.", "AuthorID": "57016564400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "7102289942": {"Name": "Steptoe A.", "AuthorID": "7102289942", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}}}
