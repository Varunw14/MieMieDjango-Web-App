In this study we applied focused exome sequencing to investigate a cohort of 100 complex adult myopathy cases who remained undiagnosed despite extensive investigation. We evaluated the frequency of genetic diagnoses, clinical and pathological factors most likely to be associated with a positive diagnosis, clinical pitfalls and new phenotypic insights that could help to guide future clinical practice. We identified pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in 32/100 cases. TTN-related myopathy was the most common diagnosis (4/32 cases) but the majority of positive diagnoses related to a single gene each. Childhood onset of symptoms was more likely to be associated with a positive diagnosis. Atypical and new clinico-pathological phenotypes with diagnostic pitfalls were identified. These include the new emerging group of neuromyopathy genes (HSPB1, BICD2) and atypical biopsy findings: COL6A-related myopathy with mitochondrial features, DOK7 presenting as myopathy with minicores and DES-related myopathy without myofibrillar pathology. Our data demonstrates the diagnostic efficacy of broad NGS screening when combined with detailed clinico-pathological phenotyping in a complex neuromuscular cohort. Atypical clinico-pathological features may delay the diagnostic process if smaller targeted gene panels are used.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Distal myopathy", "Inherited myopathies", "Molecular diagnosis", "Next generation sequencing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Female", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Muscle Proteins", "Mutation", "Myopathies, Structural, Congenital", "Phenotype"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072529170", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"24490837300": {"Name": "Bugiardini E.", "AuthorID": "24490837300", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57185293700": {"Name": "Cortese A.", "AuthorID": "57185293700", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain and Behavioral Sciences, University of Pavia"}, "56628245900": {"Name": "Gang Q.", "AuthorID": "56628245900", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "38361922200": {"Name": "Morrow J.M.", "AuthorID": "38361922200", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology and National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7402367317": {"Name": "Turner C.", "AuthorID": "7402367317", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology and National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "36183183600": {"Name": "Carr A.S.", "AuthorID": "36183183600", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology and National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57208851936": {"Name": "Quinlivan R.", "AuthorID": "57208851936", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology and National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57218107544": {"Name": "Rossor A.M.", "AuthorID": "57218107544", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7101772051": {"Name": "Holton J.L.", "AuthorID": "7101772051", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neuropathology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "6604086603": {"Name": "Parton M.", "AuthorID": "6604086603", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology and National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7201880572": {"Name": "Blake J.C.", "AuthorID": "7201880572", "AffiliationID": "60017129", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurophysiology Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital"}, "57203175311": {"Name": "Reilly M.M.", "AuthorID": "57203175311", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "35985840100": {"Name": "Matthews E.", "AuthorID": "35985840100", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "15075798500": {"Name": "Hanna M.G.", "AuthorID": "15075798500", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57209661261": {"Name": "Khan A.M.", "AuthorID": "57209661261", "AffiliationID": "116327575", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Diagnostic Unit, Clinical Laboratory Department, King Abdullah Medical City in Makkah"}, "56666751600": {"Name": "Lynch D.S.", "AuthorID": "56666751600", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57196045273": {"Name": "Pittman A.M.", "AuthorID": "57196045273", "AffiliationID": "60010426, 60029329", "AffiliationName": "St George's, University of London, Cranmer Terrace"}, "7003363686": {"Name": "Houlden H.", "AuthorID": "7003363686", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "26535084400": {"Name": "Phadke R.", "AuthorID": "26535084400", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neuropathology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7401762074": {"Name": "Feng L.", "AuthorID": "7401762074", "AffiliationID": "100624898", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neuropathology, Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, UCL Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}}}
