A prominent theory proposes that the brain monitors for unexpected uncertainty \u2013 events which deviate substantially from model predictions, indicating model failure. Norepinephrine is thought to play a key role in this process by serving as an interrupt signal, initiating model-resetting. However, evidence is from paradigms where participants actively monitored stimulus statistics. To determine whether Norepinephrine routinely reports the statistical structure of our surroundings, even when not behaviourally relevant, we used rapid tone-pip sequences that contained salient pattern-changes associated with abrupt structural violations vs. emergence of regular structure. Phasic pupil dilations (PDR) were monitored to assess Norepinephrine. We reveal a remarkable specificity: When not behaviourally relevant, only abrupt structural violations evoke a PDR. The results demonstrate that Norepinephrine tracks unexpected uncertainty on rapid time scales relevant to sensory signals.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Adult", "Arousal", "Brain", "Evoked Potentials, Auditory", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Norepinephrine", "Psychomotor Performance", "Pupil", "Reaction Time", "Sound", "Uncertainty", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071896797", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57210924658": {"Name": "Zhao S.", "AuthorID": "57210924658", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Ear Institute, University College London"}, "8953499500": {"Name": "Chait M.", "AuthorID": "8953499500", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Ear Institute, University College London"}, "14522185400": {"Name": "Dick F.", "AuthorID": "14522185400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "7006914663": {"Name": "Dayan P.", "AuthorID": "7006914663", "AffiliationID": "60004898", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics"}, "7401638726": {"Name": "Furukawa S.", "AuthorID": "7401638726", "AffiliationID": "60025555", "AffiliationName": "NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT Corporation"}, "24449111800": {"Name": "Liao H.I.", "AuthorID": "24449111800", "AffiliationID": "60025555", "AffiliationName": "NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT Corporation"}}}
