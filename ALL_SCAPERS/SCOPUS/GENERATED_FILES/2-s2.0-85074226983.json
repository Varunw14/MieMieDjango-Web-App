Light-curable methacrylate-based polymers have ideal properties for bone repair. These materials are also suitable for 3D printing which can be applicable for restoration of both function and aesthetics. The main objective of this research was to synthesize a mechanically stable and biologically functional polymer for reconstruction of complex craniofacial defects. The experimental work initially involved synthesis of (((3R,3aR,6S,6aR)-hexahydrofuro[3,2-b]furan-3,6-diyl)bis(oxy))bis(ethane-2,1-diyl)bis((4-methyl-3-oxopent-4-en-1-yl)carbamate), CSMA-1, and ((((((((((((3R,3aR,6S,6aR)-hexahydrofuro[3,2-b]furan-3,6-diyl)bis(oxy))bis(ethane-2,1 diyl))bis(oxy))bis(carbonyl))bis(azanediyl))bis(methylene))bis(3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane-5,1-diyl))bis(azanediyl))bis(carbonyl))bis(oxy))bis(ethane-2,1-diyl)bis(2-methylacrylate), CSMA-2; nuclear magnetic resonance analysis confirmed formation of the monomers, and composite samples were fabricated respectively by exposing 11 mm diameter discs to blue light. Modulus of elasticity was determined using a biaxial flexural test and the values were found to be between 1 and 3 GPa in CSMA-1, CSMA-2, and their composites. In vitro cell culture, using human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, confirmed nontoxicity of the samples and finally 3D printing allowed direct photo-polymerization and setting of the bio ink into a 3D construct.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D printing", "bone tissue engineering", "maxillofacial reconstruction", "polymer synthesis"], "IndexKeywords": ["3-D printing", "Bone tissue engineering", "Craniofacial defects", "Degradable polymers", "Human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells", "Maxillofacial reconstruction", "Mechanically stable", "Polymer synthesis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074226983", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"57195976712": {"Name": "Owji N.", "AuthorID": "57195976712", "AffiliationID": "60006776", "AffiliationName": "RAFT, Regenerative Biomaterials Group, RAFT Institute, Mount Vernon Hospital"}, "57197735718": {"Name": "Aldaadaa A.", "AuthorID": "57197735718", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Maxillofacial Diagnostic, Medicine and Surgical Sciences, Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "57211506988": {"Name": "Shakouri T.", "AuthorID": "57211506988", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "26643634100": {"Name": "Knowles J.C.", "AuthorID": "26643634100", "AffiliationID": "60002877", "AffiliationName": "UCL Eastman-Korea Dental Medicine Innovation Centre, Dankook University"}, "55375422500": {"Name": "Garc\u00eda-Gareta E.", "AuthorID": "55375422500", "AffiliationID": "60006776", "AffiliationName": "RAFT, Regenerative Biomaterials Group, RAFT Institute, Mount Vernon Hospital"}, "54411902900": {"Name": "Cha J.R.", "AuthorID": "54411902900", "AffiliationID": "60170569, 60002877", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Tissue Regeneration Engineering (ITREN), Dankook University"}, "57211729840": {"Name": "Kim H.W.", "AuthorID": "57211729840", "AffiliationID": "60002877", "AffiliationName": "UCL Eastman-Korea Dental Medicine Innovation Centre, Dankook University"}}}
