Molecular Ecology published by John Wiley & Sons LtdMany major human pathogens are multihost pathogens, able to infect other vertebrate species. Describing the general patterns of host\u2013pathogen associations across pathogen taxa is therefore important to understand risk factors for human disease emergence. However, there is a lack of comprehensive curated databases for this purpose, with most previous efforts focusing on viruses. Here, we report the largest manually compiled host\u2013pathogen association database, covering 2,595 bacteria and viruses infecting 2,656 vertebrate hosts. We also build a tree for host species using nine mitochondrial genes, giving a quantitative measure of the phylogenetic similarity of hosts. We find that the majority of bacteria and viruses are specialists infecting only a single host species, with bacteria having a significantly higher proportion of specialists compared to viruses. Conversely, multihost viruses have a more restricted host range than multihost bacteria. We perform multiple analyses of factors associated with pathogen richness per host species and the pathogen traits associated with greater host range and zoonotic potential. We show that factors previously identified as important for zoonotic potential in viruses\u2014such as phylogenetic range, research effort, and being vector-borne\u2014are also predictive in bacteria. We find that the fraction of pathogens shared between two hosts decreases with the phylogenetic distance between them. Our results suggest that host phylogenetic similarity is the primary factor for host-switching in pathogens.", "AuthorKeywords": ["emerging infectious diseases", "host jumps", "host range", "phylogenetics", "zoonotic diseases"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085931718", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"57191197591": {"Name": "Shaw L.P.", "AuthorID": "57191197591", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851, 60008323", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford"}, "57217050047": {"Name": "Wang A.D.", "AuthorID": "57217050047", "AffiliationID": "60105484", "AffiliationName": "Canadian University Dubai"}, "57217048977": {"Name": "Meier M.", "AuthorID": "57217048977", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, University College London Institute of Child Health"}, "57217048240": {"Name": "Pogacnik G.", "AuthorID": "57217048240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Genetics Institute, University College London"}, "6701693410": {"Name": "Balloux F.", "AuthorID": "6701693410", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Genetics Institute, University College London"}, "55903302000": {"Name": "Dylus D.", "AuthorID": "55903302000", "AffiliationID": "60026285", "AffiliationName": "Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics"}, "11739647400": {"Name": "Dessimoz C.", "AuthorID": "11739647400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
