To achieve a successful future market take-up of MaaS it is important to develop prototype business models to offer high-value bundled mobility services to customers, as well as enable the MaaS operator and the involved actors to capture value. This paper aims at investigating the business perspective of MaaS by collecting qualitative data from workshops and in-depth interviews in three European metropolitan areas: Budapest, Greater Manchester and the city of Luxembourg. The analysis of the collected data contributed to the in-depth analysis of the MaaS business ecosystem and the identification of the champions of MaaS in the three areas. Prototype business models for MaaS are developed based on the Osterwalder's canvas, to describe how MaaS operators may create, deliver, and capture value. Our findings indicate that the MaaS ecosystem comprises of public and private actors who need to cooperate and compete in order to capture value. Although noticeable deviations among the study areas are observed, mobility service providers, public transport authorities and regional authorities were commonly indicated as the key actors in a MaaS partnership. In addition, viewed as a system, enablers and barriers to MaaS are identified based on the systems\u2019 of innovation approach. The analysis indicates that the regulatory framework of the cities, the lack of standardization and openness of the application programming interfaces and the need for transport-related investments constitute risks for the successful implementation of MaaS in the study areas. Trust between MaaS actors and cooperation in e-ticketing are key enablers in some of the study areas.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Business model canvas", "Enablers and barriers to MaaS", "MaaS ecosystem", "Mobility as a Service", "Value proposition"], "IndexKeywords": ["Business modeling", "Business perspective", "Enablers and barriers to MaaS", "Environmental benefits", "Public transport authority", "Regional authorities", "Regulatory frameworks", "Value proposition"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072544199", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"], ["Management Science and Operations Research", "DECI", "1803"]], "AuthorData": {"6602644697": {"Name": "Polydoropoulou A.", "AuthorID": "6602644697", "AffiliationID": "60017404", "AffiliationName": "Department of Shipping, Trade and Transport, University of the Aegean"}, "55754084400": {"Name": "Pagoni I.", "AuthorID": "55754084400", "AffiliationID": "60017404", "AffiliationName": "Department of Shipping, Trade and Transport, University of the Aegean"}, "16302812600": {"Name": "Tsirimpa A.", "AuthorID": "16302812600", "AffiliationID": "60017404", "AffiliationName": "Department of Shipping, Trade and Transport, University of the Aegean"}, "11940164700": {"Name": "Roumboutsos A.", "AuthorID": "11940164700", "AffiliationID": "60017404", "AffiliationName": "Department of Shipping, Trade and Transport, University of the Aegean"}, "57195940669": {"Name": "Tsouros I.", "AuthorID": "57195940669", "AffiliationID": "60017404", "AffiliationName": "Department of Shipping, Trade and Transport, University of the Aegean"}, "49861504700": {"Name": "Kamargianni M.", "AuthorID": "49861504700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "MaaSLab, Energy Institute, University College London"}}}
