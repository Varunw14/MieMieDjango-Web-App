However, there is little research about how demographic factors (such as age, gender, ethnicity, personality, and socioeconomic status) or factors relating to creative engagement (including engagement behaviors and subjective experience of engagement) influence our ability to use artistic creative activities to regulate our emotions. We analyzed data from 40,949 adults and used a structural equation modeling approach to model the relationships among demographic factors, factors relating to engagement, and our use of emotion regulation strategies (ERSs) while engaging in artistic creative activities. We found that women make more use of creative activities to regulate their emotions than do men, as do those of lower socioeconomic status. Training in doing an artistic activity, regular engagement, and enjoyment while engaging are all associated with a greater ability to use artistic activities to regulate our emotions. We also identified relationships between demographic and engagement factors and specific types of ERSs, such as avoidance strategies (e.g., distraction, suppression, or detachment from negative or stressful emotions), approach strategies (e.g., acceptance, reappraisal and problem solving), and self-development strategies (e.g., enhanced self-identity, improved self-esteem, and increased agency). Artistic creative activities are increasingly being recognized as effective ways of regulating emotional responses. Overall, this study provides insight into the interrelationship between individual attributes, modifiable patterns of engagement and emotion regulation when engaging in artistic activities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Arts", "Creativity", "Emotion regulation", "Emotions", "Engagement"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078632381", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Visual Arts and Performing Arts", "ARTS", "1213"], ["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"]], "AuthorData": {"55911947100": {"Name": "Fancourt D.", "AuthorID": "55911947100", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57214534008": {"Name": "Garnett C.", "AuthorID": "57214534008", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "23019169400": {"Name": "M\u00fcllensiefen D.", "AuthorID": "23019169400", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
