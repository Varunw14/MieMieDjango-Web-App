All rights reserved.The tremendous heterogeneity of the human population presents a major obstacle in understanding how autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS) contribute to variations in human peripheral immune signatures. To minimize heterogeneity, we made use of a unique cohort of 43 monozygotic twin pairs clinically discordant for MS and searched for disease-related peripheral immune signatures in a systems biology approach covering a broad range of adaptive and innate immune populations on the protein level. Despite disease discordance, the immune signatures of MS-affected and unaffected cotwins were remarkably similar. Twinship alone contributed 56% of the immune variation, whereas MS explained 1 to 2% of the immune variance. Notably, distinct traits in CD4+ effector T cell subsets emerged when we focused on a subgroup of twins with signs of subclinical, prodromal MS in the clinically healthy cotwin. Some of these early-disease immune traits were confirmed in a second independent cohort of untreated early relapsing-remitting MS patients. Early involvement of effector T cell subsets thus points to a key role of T cells in MS disease initiation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autoimmunity", "Biomarker", "Immune phenotyping", "Monozygotic twins", "Multiple sclerosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Biomarkers", "Cohort Studies", "DNA Methylation", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Prodromal Symptoms", "Twins, Monozygotic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090507909", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"37032771900": {"Name": "Gerdes L.A.", "AuthorID": "37032771900", "AffiliationID": "60000291, 60028717", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Neuroimmunology, University Hospital and Biomedical Center, Ludwig-Maximilians Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"}, "6504242135": {"Name": "Flierl-Hecht A.", "AuthorID": "6504242135", "AffiliationID": "60000291, 60028717", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Neuroimmunology, University Hospital and Biomedical Center, Ludwig-Maximilians Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"}, "57218447886": {"Name": "K\u00fcmpfel T.", "AuthorID": "57218447886", "AffiliationID": "60000291, 60028717", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Neuroimmunology, University Hospital and Biomedical Center, Ludwig-Maximilians Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"}, "7103040061": {"Name": "Hohlfeld R.", "AuthorID": "7103040061", "AffiliationID": "114439723", "AffiliationName": "Munich Cluster of Systems Neurology"}, "57191539252": {"Name": "Janoschka C.", "AuthorID": "57191539252", "AffiliationID": "60006490", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Institute of Translational Neurology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster"}, "57218865684": {"Name": "Mannig B.", "AuthorID": "57218865684", "AffiliationID": "60006490", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Institute of Translational Neurology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster"}, "36459403900": {"Name": "Wirth T.", "AuthorID": "36459403900", "AffiliationID": "60006490", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Institute of Translational Neurology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster"}, "56820156900": {"Name": "Schulte-Mecklenbeck A.", "AuthorID": "56820156900", "AffiliationID": "60006490", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Institute of Translational Neurology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster"}, "57218865587": {"Name": "Lauks S.", "AuthorID": "57218865587", "AffiliationID": "60006490", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Institute of Translational Neurology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster"}, "7402265417": {"Name": "Gross C.C.", "AuthorID": "7402265417", "AffiliationID": "60006490", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Institute of Translational Neurology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster"}, "6507628722": {"Name": "Meuth S.G.", "AuthorID": "6507628722", "AffiliationID": "60006490", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Institute of Translational Neurology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster"}, "55018880100": {"Name": "Wiendl H.", "AuthorID": "55018880100", "AffiliationID": "60006490", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Institute of Translational Neurology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster"}, "8935391400": {"Name": "Klotz L.", "AuthorID": "8935391400", "AffiliationID": "60006490", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Institute of Translational Neurology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster"}, "53881211800": {"Name": "Eveslage M.", "AuthorID": "53881211800", "AffiliationID": "60000401", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biostatistics and Clinical Research, University of M\u00fcnster"}, "57196024279": {"Name": "Glau L.", "AuthorID": "57196024279", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"}, "7103009870": {"Name": "Tolosa E.", "AuthorID": "7103009870", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"}, "35497782900": {"Name": "Ertl-Wagner B.", "AuthorID": "35497782900", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Imaging, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto"}, "57204594265": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "57204594265", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, VU University Medical Center"}}}
