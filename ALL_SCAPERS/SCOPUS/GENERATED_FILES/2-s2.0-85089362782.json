Microfocus computed tomography has been reported as a viable option in small case series with the potential to avoid an invasive autopsy. Implementation of postmortem microfocus computed tomography in a large cohort as part of routine clinical service has yet been unreported, and realistic \u201cautopsy prevention rates\u201d are unknown. Objective: This study aimed to describe the range of abnormalities detectable on fetal microfocus computed tomography in a clinical setting and additional findings identified on the antenatal ultrasound and to estimate the invasive autopsy avoidance rate (ie, cases in which imaging was sufficient to deem autopsy unnecessary). Study Design: A prospective observational case series of all fetuses referred for microfocus computed tomography imaging at a single institution was conducted for 3 years (2016\u20132019). Imaging was reported by 2 pediatric radiologists before autopsy, with \u201cdecision to proceed\u201d based on the specialist perinatal pathologists\u2019 judgment and parental consent. Agreement rates between microfocus computed tomography and antenatal ultrasound were evaluated, and where feasible, diagnostic accuracy for microfocus computed tomography was calculated using autopsy as a reference standard. Results: A total of 268 fetuses were included (2\u2013350 grams body weight; 11\u201324 weeks\u2019 gestation), with cause for demise in 122 of 268 (45.5%). Of the 122 fetuses, 64 (52.5%) exhibited fetal anomalies. Although 221 of 268 (82.5%) fetuses had consent for invasive autopsy, only 29 of the 221 (13.1%) underwent this procedure, which implied an autopsy avoidance rate of 192 of 221 (86.9%). Complete agreement was present for all brain, thoracic, and abdominal pathologies, whereas sensitivity and specificity for cardiac anomalies were 66.7% and 91.7%, respectively. Microfocus computed tomography and antenatal ultrasound agreement was found in 219 of 266 cases (81.9%), with partial agreement in 21 of 266 (7.9%) and disagreement in 26 of 266 (10.5%), mostly because of additional cardiac, soft tissue, or genitourinary findings by microfocus computed tomography, which were not seen on the ultrasound. Conclusion: Fetal microfocus computed tomography imaging is a viable and useful tool for imaging early gestational fetuses and can avoid the need for invasive autopsy. Confirmation of antenatal diagnoses is achieved in most cases, and additional anomalies may also be detected.", "AuthorKeywords": ["autopsy", "congenital anomalies", "diagnosis", "microfocus computed tomography", "minimally invasive", "miscarriage", "postmortem", "radiology", "termination", "virtual autopsy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Abnormalities, Multiple", "Autopsy", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Fetal Death", "Fetus", "Gestational Age", "Humans", "Pregnancy", "Prospective Studies", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089362782", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"55545709400": {"Name": "Shelmerdine S.C.", "AuthorID": "55545709400", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60172674", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "36622825800": {"Name": "Simcock I.C.", "AuthorID": "36622825800", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60172674", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "56603796700": {"Name": "Guy A.", "AuthorID": "56603796700", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Radiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "6507902996": {"Name": "Arthurs O.J.", "AuthorID": "6507902996", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60172674", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "57049165000": {"Name": "Sebire N.J.", "AuthorID": "57049165000", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60172674", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "57006097800": {"Name": "Hutchinson J.C.", "AuthorID": "57006097800", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Pathology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "7005599289": {"Name": "Ashworth M.T.", "AuthorID": "7005599289", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Pathology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}}}
