In this paper, we demonstrate the use of food 3D printing to create perceptual illusions for controlling the level of perceived satiety given a defined amount of calories. We present FoodFab, a system that allows users to control their food intake through modifying a food's internal structure via two 3D printing parameters: infill pattern and infill density. In two experiments with a total of 30 participants, we studied the effect of these parameters on users' chewing time that is known to affect people's feeling of satiety. Our results show that we can indeed modify the chewing time by varying infill pattern and density, and thus control perceived satiety. Based on the results, we propose two computational models and integrate them into a user interface that simplifies the creation of personalized food structures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fabrication techniques", "Food 3D printer", "Food perception", "Food-interaction design", "Personal fabrication"], "IndexKeywords": ["3-D printing", "Computational model", "Food intake", "Food structures", "Internal structure"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090219716", "SubjectAreas": [["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"55974259100": {"Name": "Punpongsanon P.", "AuthorID": "55974259100", "AffiliationID": "60024322", "AffiliationName": "Osaka University"}, "55931917600": {"Name": "Iwai D.", "AuthorID": "55931917600", "AffiliationID": "60024322", "AffiliationName": "Osaka University"}, "56192879500": {"Name": "Sato K.", "AuthorID": "56192879500", "AffiliationID": "60024322", "AffiliationName": "Osaka University"}, "57218764902": {"Name": "Lin Y.J.", "AuthorID": "57218764902", "AffiliationID": "60012370", "AffiliationName": "National Chiao Tung University"}, "57202051270": {"Name": "Wen X.", "AuthorID": "57202051270", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "55479874800": {"Name": "Mueller S.", "AuthorID": "55479874800", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "22835490000": {"Name": "Obrist M.", "AuthorID": "22835490000", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "University of Sussex"}}}
