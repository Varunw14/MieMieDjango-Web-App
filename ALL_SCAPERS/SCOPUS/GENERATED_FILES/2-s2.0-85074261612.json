Eight family members over 4 generations are affected in a pattern consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance. A causal role for the FOXF2 gene has been identified and previously reported. We describe the management of the proband, which involved attempting to lengthen the palate and to retroposition the abnormally anteriorly directed velar musculature, along with speech therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["absent uvula", "familial", "FOXF2", "hypernasality", "speech disorder", "velopharyngeal incompetence"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cleft Palate", "Forkhead Transcription Factors", "Humans", "Palate, Soft", "Pharynx", "Syndrome", "Uvula", "Velopharyngeal Insufficiency"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074261612", "SubjectAreas": [["Oral Surgery", "DENT", "3504"], ["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"]], "AuthorData": {"7005483614": {"Name": "Sommerlad B.", "AuthorID": "7005483614", "AffiliationID": "60004202, 60116404, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "North Thames Cleft Centre, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust, London and St Andrew\u2019s Centre, Broomfield Hospital"}, "7102997330": {"Name": "Lees M.", "AuthorID": "7102997330", "AffiliationID": "60004202, 60116404, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "North Thames Cleft Centre, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust, London and St Andrew\u2019s Centre, Broomfield Hospital"}, "7006548630": {"Name": "Sell D.", "AuthorID": "7006548630", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Outcomes and Experience Research in Children\u2019s Health, Illness and Disability (ORCHID), Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36103319200": {"Name": "Seselgyte R.", "AuthorID": "36103319200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL GOS Institute of Child Health"}, "7006454348": {"Name": "Stanier P.", "AuthorID": "7006454348", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL GOS Institute of Child Health"}, "57208312191": {"Name": "Pauws E.", "AuthorID": "57208312191", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer, UCL GOS Institute of Child Health"}}}
