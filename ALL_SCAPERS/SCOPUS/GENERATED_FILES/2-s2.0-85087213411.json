Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.China has entered the economic transition in the post-financial crisis era, with unprecedented new features that significantly lead to a decline in its carbon emissions. However, regional disparity implies different trajectories in regional decarbonisation. Here, we construct multi-regional input-output tables (MRIO) for 2012 and 2015 and quantitatively evaluate the regional disparity in decarbonisation and the driving forces during 2012-2015. We found China's consumption-based emissions peaked in 2013, largely driven by a peak in consumption-based emissions from developing regions. Declined intensity and industrial structures are determinants due to the economic transition. The rise of the Southwest and Central regions of China have become a new feature, driving up emissions embodied in trade and have reinforced the pattern of carbon flows in the post-financial crisis period. Export-related emissions have bounced up after years of decline, attributed to soaring export volume and export structure in the Southeast and North of the country. The disparity in developing regions has become the new feature in shaping China's economy and decarbonisation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["2015", "China", "consumption-based emissions", "economic transition", "peak"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carbon emissions", "Decarbonisation", "Developing regions", "Economic transitions", "Industrial structures", "Input-output table", "Post financial crisis", "Regional disparities"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087213411", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"54411744100": {"Name": "Zheng H.", "AuthorID": "54411744100", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "Water Security Research Centre, School of International Development, University of East Anglia"}, "54384023000": {"Name": "Ou J.", "AuthorID": "54384023000", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "Water Security Research Centre, School of International Development, University of East Anglia"}, "57193542903": {"Name": "Zhang Z.", "AuthorID": "57193542903", "AffiliationID": "60019533", "AffiliationName": "College of Management and Economics, Tianjin University"}, "57191891533": {"Name": "Wei W.", "AuthorID": "57191891533", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "School of International and Public Affairs, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "26422516400": {"Name": "Song M.", "AuthorID": "26422516400", "AffiliationID": "60108842", "AffiliationName": "School of Statistics and Applied Mathematics, Anhui University of Finance and Economics"}, "6701504494": {"Name": "Dietzenbacher E.", "AuthorID": "6701504494", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Economics and Business, University of Groningen"}, "57210584499": {"Name": "Wang X.", "AuthorID": "57210584499", "AffiliationID": "60013503", "AffiliationName": "School of International Trade and Economics, University of International Business and Economics"}, "55975044300": {"Name": "Meng J.", "AuthorID": "55975044300", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London"}, "56015318000": {"Name": "Shan Y.", "AuthorID": "56015318000", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "Energy and Sustainability Research Institute Groningen, University of Groningen"}, "15839411900": {"Name": "Guan D.", "AuthorID": "15839411900", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth System Science, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Earth System Modelling, Tsinghua University"}}}
