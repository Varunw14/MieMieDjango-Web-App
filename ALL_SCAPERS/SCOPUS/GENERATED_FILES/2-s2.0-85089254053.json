This study examined the views of teachers and digital software designers on children\u2019s use of smart personalized technologies in Japan. Sixteen teachers and two designers from Japan took part in semi-structured interviews on the school or company premises in Tokyo and Osaka. Thematic analysis of the transcripts yielded three themes: agency, privacy and autonomy, which we consider through the lens of socio-materiality. While there were clear concerns about the protection of children\u2019s privacy with personalized technologies, children\u2019s agency and autonomy in using them was perceived both as a benefit and limitation of digital personalization features. The participants\u2019 paradoxical perceptions of the risks and benefits of personalization point to a complex socio-technological model of personalization that is embedded in children\u2019s smart technologies and influences adults\u2019 views on their use in early education. Our findings have implications for informing and theorising the design of personalization features in digital technologies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cross-cultural studies", "Early education", "Individualism", "Japan", "Personalization", "Socio-materiality", "Tablets", "Technologies"], "IndexKeywords": ["Digital technologies", "Personalizations", "Semi structured interviews", "Smart technology", "Socio materialities", "Software designers", "Thematic analysis", "Through the lens"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089254053", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (miscellaneous)", "MATH", "2601"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"54408784700": {"Name": "Kucirkova N.", "AuthorID": "54408784700", "AffiliationID": "60014497", "AffiliationName": "Norwegian Centre for Learning Environment and Behavioural Research, University of Stavanger"}, "57218456773": {"Name": "Toda Y.", "AuthorID": "57218456773", "AffiliationID": "60002882", "AffiliationName": "Osaka Kyoiku University"}, "22833925100": {"Name": "Flewitt R.", "AuthorID": "22833925100", "AffiliationID": "60022046", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Metropolitan University"}}}
