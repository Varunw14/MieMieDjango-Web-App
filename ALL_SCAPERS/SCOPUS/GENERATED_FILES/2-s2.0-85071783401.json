In this work, a model of the frequency-dependent directional response of the FP sensor was developed using the global matrix method, treating the sensor as a multilayered elastic structure. The model was validated against the experimentally measured directional response of an air-backed cover-slip FP sensor with well-known material properties. In addition, the model was compared with the measurements of an all-hard-dielectric sensor suitable for HIFU measurements. The model was then used to calculate modal dispersion curves for both glass-etalon sensors, allowing the features of the directional response to be linked to specific wave phenomena. The features in the directivity of the air-backed cover-slip sensor are due to guided Lamb waves. Symmetric Lamb modes give rise to regions of high sensitivity, whereas anti-symmetric modes cause regions of low sensitivity. For the all-hard-dielectric sensor, two features correspond to the water-substrate and water-spacer compressional and shear critical angles. A region of high sensitivity close to the shear critical angle is associated with a leaky-Rayleigh wave, which has a frequency-dependent phase speed. At higher frequencies, this feature is counteracted by a region of low sensitivity, which occurs when there is no difference in the vertical displacement of the mirrors forming the FP cavity. The model may be used to improve and optimize the design of FP sensors or could be used to assist with the accurate deconvolution of the directional response from array measurements in metrological and imaging applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Directivity", "Fabry-P\u00e9rot (FP)", "guided waves", "matrix methods"], "IndexKeywords": ["Directional response", "Directivity", "High intensity focused ultrasound", "Imaging applications", "Matrix methods", "Metrological applications", "Piezoelectric sensors", "Vertical displacements"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071783401", "SubjectAreas": [["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57200088418": {"Name": "Ramasawmy D.R.", "AuthorID": "57200088418", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "35113555000": {"Name": "Martin E.", "AuthorID": "35113555000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "44061273200": {"Name": "Guggenheim J.A.", "AuthorID": "44061273200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7102686951": {"Name": "Zhang E.Z.", "AuthorID": "7102686951", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006238023": {"Name": "Beard P.C.", "AuthorID": "7006238023", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "16200175900": {"Name": "Treeby B.E.", "AuthorID": "16200175900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7403198742": {"Name": "Cox B.T.", "AuthorID": "7403198742", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
