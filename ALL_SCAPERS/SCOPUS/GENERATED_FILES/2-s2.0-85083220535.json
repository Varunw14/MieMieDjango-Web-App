Distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution NonCommercial License 4.0 (CC BY-NC).Despite sustained research, application of lead halide perovskites in field-effect transistors (FETs) has substantial concerns in terms of operational instabilities and hysteresis effects which are linked to its ionic nature. Here, we investigate the mechanism behind these instabilities and demonstrate an effective route to suppress them to realize high-performance perovskite FETs with low hysteresis, high threshold voltage stability (\u0394Vt < 2 V over 10 hours of continuous operation), and high mobility values >1 cm2/V\u00b7s at room temperature. We show that multiple cation incorporation using strain-relieving cations like Cs and cations such as Rb, which act as passivation/crystallization modifying agents, is an effective strategy for reducing vacancy concentration and ion migration in perovskite FETs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that treatment of perovskite films with positive azeotrope solvents that act as Lewis bases (acids) enables a further reduction in defect density and substantial improvement in performance and stability of n-type (p-type) perovskite devices.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Continuous operation", "Halide perovskites", "High-threshold voltages", "Hysteresis effect", "Multiple cations", "Perovskite films", "Research , application", "Vacancy concentration"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083220535", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"36646741800": {"Name": "Senanayak S.P.", "AuthorID": "36646741800", "AffiliationID": "60019199, 60009244", "AffiliationName": "CSIR- Institute of Minerals and Materials Technology Council of Scientific and Industrial Research"}, "55864987800": {"Name": "Abdi-Jalebi M.", "AuthorID": "55864987800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Materials Discovery, University College London"}, "56381111400": {"Name": "Kamboj V.S.", "AuthorID": "56381111400", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "57207934653": {"Name": "Carey R.", "AuthorID": "57207934653", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "55354185800": {"Name": "Shivanna R.", "AuthorID": "55354185800", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "35305697900": {"Name": "Schweicher G.", "AuthorID": "35305697900", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "57200629901": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "57200629901", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "36672622600": {"Name": "Di Nuzzo D.", "AuthorID": "36672622600", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "7005719934": {"Name": "Beere H.E.", "AuthorID": "7005719934", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "36050490200": {"Name": "Ritchie D.A.", "AuthorID": "36050490200", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Swansea University"}, "8077782000": {"Name": "Friend R.H.", "AuthorID": "8077782000", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "7006871934": {"Name": "Sirringhaus H.", "AuthorID": "7006871934", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "57216354574": {"Name": "Tian T.", "AuthorID": "57216354574", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus"}, "8556349500": {"Name": "Fairen-Jimenez D.", "AuthorID": "8556349500", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Adsorp-tion and Advanced Materials (AAM) Laboratory, Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Cambridge"}, "56108686400": {"Name": "Giesbrecht N.", "AuthorID": "56108686400", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department Chemie, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t-M\u00fcnchen"}, "36672699200": {"Name": "Docampo P.", "AuthorID": "36672699200", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics, Statistics and Physics, Newcastle University, Herschel Building"}}}
