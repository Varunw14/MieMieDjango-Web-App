Obtained data show that natural cork has a good affinity toward Bisphenol A, with removal efficiency being as high as 75% in less than 24 h. The adsorption process is characterized by a fast-initial rate which tends to reduce progressively, and follows a pseudo second order model equation. Statistical physics analysis allows for obtaining a molecular description of the adsorption, which is shown to take place through a single anchorage point, perpendicularly to the adsorbent surface. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and fluorescence analysis reveal that the colloidal organic matter released from the cork interacts with Bisphenol A; it also plays a relevant role in the slowing down of the adsorption rate, as it competes with cork adsorption sites for Bisphenol A. Organic matter is found to be highly heterogenous, presenting at the same time carbohydrates, aromatic and aliphatic domains. Such moieties interact stably with the contaminant in the solution probably due the establishment of dispersive forces (e.g. \u03c0-stacking) which sequestrate Bisphenol A into the inner hydrophobic core of the organic matter three-dimensional structure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adsorption", "Bisphenol a", "Cork", "Emerging contaminant", "Organic matter"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bis-phenol a", "Cork", "Emerging contaminant", "Fluorescence analysis", "Molecular descriptions", "Pseudo-second order model", "Removal efficiencies", "Three-dimensional structure"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072933548", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"57211193935": {"Name": "Pirozzi C.", "AuthorID": "57211193935", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "55192330700": {"Name": "Pontoni L.", "AuthorID": "55192330700", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Architectural and Environmental Engineering, University of Naples Federico II"}, "21740838800": {"Name": "Fabbricino M.", "AuthorID": "21740838800", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Architectural and Environmental Engineering, University of Naples Federico II"}, "14043273200": {"Name": "Campos L.", "AuthorID": "14043273200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "22952845400": {"Name": "Bogush A.", "AuthorID": "22952845400", "AffiliationID": "60017326", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Agroecology, Water and Resilience, Coventry University"}}}
