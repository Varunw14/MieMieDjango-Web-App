A possible strategy for reducing this energy in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and operational costs is to specify high-performance facades. However, their benefits remain unclear for UK conditions with mild winters and cool summers. This paper reports on an investigation on the energy demand of offices in London, UK, incorporating facades with U-values between 1\u00b72 and 2\u00b76 W/(m2 K) and g-values between 0\u00b73 and 0\u00b75 using the dynamic simulation tool Tas. Other variables considered included climate change (using the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers' future weather data files), low internal gains, long working hours and office orientation. It was found that, apart from the case when internal gains are low, cooling is overwhelmingly necessary and energy usage increases with decreasing U-value and decreases with decreasing g-value. Low-U-value facades act to reduce conduction heat losses, thereby increasing energy use. Conversely, low-g-value facades act to reduce solar heat gains, thereby reducing the energy required for cooling. The results are used to highlight deficiencies in The Building Regulations 2010 and where more advice would be of benefit. The paper also discusses the merits of a number of strategies for reducing energy use in office buildings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["buildings, structures & design", "energy conservation", "weather"], "IndexKeywords": ["Building regulations", "Carbon dioxide emissions", "Chartered institution of building services engineers", "Dynamic simulation tool", "Future weathers", "Heating and cooling", "Heating/cooling loads", "Solar heat gains"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083366746", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"]], "AuthorData": {"57216397589": {"Name": "Wang W.", "AuthorID": "57216397589", "AffiliationID": "60111026", "AffiliationName": "Network Rail"}, "57199300154": {"Name": "Arya C.", "AuthorID": "57199300154", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
