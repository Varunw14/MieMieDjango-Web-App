Over the past decades, a variety of complex systems has been successfully described as networks whose interacting pairs of nodes are connected by links. Yet, from human communications to chemical reactions and ecological systems, interactions can often occur in groups of three or more nodes and cannot be described simply in terms of dyads. Until recently little attention has been devoted to the higher-order architecture of real complex systems. However, a mounting body of evidence is showing that taking the higher-order structure of these systems into account can enhance our modeling capacities and help us understand and predict their dynamical behavior. Here we present a complete overview of the emerging field of networks beyond pairwise interactions. We discuss how to represent higher-order interactions and introduce the different frameworks used to describe higher-order systems, highlighting the links between the existing concepts and representations. We review the measures designed to characterize the structure of these systems and the models proposed to generate synthetic structures, such as random and growing bipartite graphs, hypergraphs and simplicial complexes. We introduce the rapidly growing research on higher-order dynamical systems and dynamical topology, discussing the relations between higher-order interactions and collective behavior. We focus in particular on new emergent phenomena characterizing dynamical processes, such as diffusion, synchronization, spreading, social dynamics and games, when extended beyond pairwise interactions. We conclude with a summary of empirical applications, and an outlook on current modeling and conceptual frontiers.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087951894", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56122454100": {"Name": "Battiston F.", "AuthorID": "56122454100", "AffiliationID": "60009563", "AffiliationName": "Department of Network and Data Science, Central European University"}, "56537036600": {"Name": "Cencetti G.", "AuthorID": "56537036600", "AffiliationID": "60083112", "AffiliationName": "Mobs Lab, Fondazione Bruno Kessler"}, "24474549700": {"Name": "Iacopini I.", "AuthorID": "24474549700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College London, London, W1T 4TJ"}, "7003540219": {"Name": "Latora V.", "AuthorID": "7003540219", "AffiliationID": "60159349", "AffiliationName": "Complexity Science Hub Vienna (CSHV)"}, "57220564652": {"Name": "Lucas M.", "AuthorID": "57220564652", "AffiliationID": "60102127, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, Centrale Marseille, I2M, Turing Center for Living Systems"}, "57194574318": {"Name": "Patania A.", "AuthorID": "57194574318", "AffiliationID": "60021121", "AffiliationName": "Network Science Institute, Indiana University"}, "55796127900": {"Name": "Young J.G.", "AuthorID": "55796127900", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Center for the Study of Complex Systems, University of Michigan"}, "36634617200": {"Name": "Petri G.", "AuthorID": "36634617200", "AffiliationID": "117724740", "AffiliationName": "ISI Global Science Foundation, 33 W 42nd St, 10036 New York"}}}
