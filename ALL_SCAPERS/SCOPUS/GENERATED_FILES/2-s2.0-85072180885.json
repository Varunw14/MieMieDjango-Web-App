CoTEDS will enable research on genetic and environmental factors that underpin parent-child associations, with a focus on mental health and cognitive-related traits. Through CoTEDS, we will have a new lens to examine the roles that parents play in influencing child development, as well as the genetic and environmental factors that shape parenting behavior and experiences. Recruitment is ongoing from the sample of approximately 20,000 contactable adult twins who have been enrolled in the Twins Early Development Study (TEDS) since infancy. TEDS twins are invited to register all offspring to CoTEDS at birth, with 554 children registered as of May 2019. By recruiting the second generation of TEDS participants, CoTEDS will include information on adult twins and their offspring from infancy. Parent questionnaire-based data collection is now underway for 1- and 2-year-old CoTEDS infants, with further waves of data collection planned. Current data collection includes the following primary constructs: child mental health, temperament, language and cognitive development; parent mental health and social relationships; parenting behaviors and feelings; and other socioecological factors. Measurement tools have been selected with reference to existing genetically informative cohort studies to ensure overlap in phenotypes measured at corresponding stages of development. This built-in study overlap is intended to enable replication and triangulation of future analyses across samples and research designs. Here, we summarize study protocols and measurement procedures and describe future plans.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Behavioral genetics", "children-of-twins", "families", "longitudinal", "offspring", "parents"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Child", "Child Behavior Disorders", "Child Development", "Child of Impaired Parents", "Child, Preschool", "Diseases in Twins", "Female", "Humans", "Incidence", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Mental Health", "Parent-Child Relations", "Parenting", "Prospective Studies", "Registries", "Temperament", "Twins", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072180885", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"57208899074": {"Name": "Ahmadzadeh Y.I.", "AuthorID": "57208899074", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7003787769": {"Name": "Eley T.C.", "AuthorID": "7003787769", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "57209335477": {"Name": "Plomin R.", "AuthorID": "57209335477", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "20434272100": {"Name": "McMillan A.", "AuthorID": "20434272100", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "55002773000": {"Name": "McAdams T.A.", "AuthorID": "55002773000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7101987679": {"Name": "Dale P.S.", "AuthorID": "7101987679", "AffiliationID": "60033021", "AffiliationName": "Department of Speech and Hearing Sciences, University of New Mexico"}, "16429683500": {"Name": "Lester K.J.", "AuthorID": "16429683500", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Sussex"}, "7103184743": {"Name": "Oliver B.R.", "AuthorID": "7103184743", "AffiliationID": "60010964", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Goldsmiths, University of London"}}}
