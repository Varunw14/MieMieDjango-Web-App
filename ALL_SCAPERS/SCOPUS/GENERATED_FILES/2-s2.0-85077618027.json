This finding is so consistent that David Weisburd refers to this as the \u201claw of crime concentration at place\u201d. However, most research on crime concentration has been conducted in the US or European cities and has used secondary data sources. In this study, we examine whether the law of crime concentration applies in the context of sub-Saharan Africa using primary data. Methods: A crime victimization survey was used to collect data in the city of Kaduna (Nigeria). Using these data, the concentration of crime (breaking-and-entering and domestic theft) was examined at the household, street segment, and neighborhood levels. Specifically, variants of a Lorenz curve and the Gini index (GI) were used to examine whether crime concentrates at these different spatial scales and if such concentration reflects anything beyond the spatial distribution of opportunity for these types of offenses. Results: Crime was found to concentrate at all spatial scales, and having accounted for expectation, given the distribution of opportunity, crime was most concentrated at the household level, closely followed by street segments. It was relatively less concentrated at the neighborhood level. Conclusion: The current study extends previous research in a number of ways. It shows that the law of crime concentration at place applies in a very different context to most previous work. Unlike previous studies, we use primary data collected specifically to test the law, avoiding problems associated with the dark figure of crime. Moreover, the findings persist after accounting for crime opportunity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Breaking and entering", "Crime concentration", "Kaduna", "Monte Carlo simulation", "Nigeria", "Theft"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077618027", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"57203149871": {"Name": "Umar F.", "AuthorID": "57203149871", "AffiliationID": "60010799", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urban and Regional Planning, Ahmadu Bello University"}, "8894355600": {"Name": "Johnson S.", "AuthorID": "8894355600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}, "55111283100": {"Name": "Cheshire J.", "AuthorID": "55111283100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}}}
