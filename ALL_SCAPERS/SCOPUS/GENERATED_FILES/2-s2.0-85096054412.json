To increase the range of compounds that can be employed with the CSM, a range of different MOFs must be investigated. In this study we have explored the use of a lanthanide-based MOF, RUM-2, recently shown to have potential as a CSM host. Specifically, we have successfully formed five novel inclusion complexes with the four aromatic guests: 2-phenylethanol, benzyl acetate, benzyl benzoate, and vanillin and the non-aromatic herbicide molinate. A detailed analysis of the effect of size on the positions guest molecules sit within the pores of the MOF was performed. The \u221d\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u221d, CH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u221d, hydrogen-bonding, and coordination host-guest and guest-guest interactions utilized in guest ordering were also investigated, and the disorder experienced by guest molecules was documented.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["2-phenylethanol", "Benzyl benzoate", "Crystalline metals", "Effect of sizes", "Guest molecules", "Herbicide molinate", "Inclusion complex", "Target compound"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096054412", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57219911582": {"Name": "Lunn R.D.J.", "AuthorID": "57219911582", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Chemistry"}, "7005072839": {"Name": "Tocher D.A.", "AuthorID": "7005072839", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Chemistry"}, "7003437916": {"Name": "Carmalt C.J.", "AuthorID": "7003437916", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Chemistry"}, "57219917341": {"Name": "Sidebottom P.J.", "AuthorID": "57219917341", "AffiliationID": "60012970", "AffiliationName": "Syngenta, Jealott's Hill International Research Centre"}, "57193511962": {"Name": "Montgomery M.G.", "AuthorID": "57193511962", "AffiliationID": "60012970", "AffiliationName": "Syngenta, Jealott's Hill International Research Centre"}, "57219914806": {"Name": "Keates A.C.", "AuthorID": "57219914806", "AffiliationID": "60012970", "AffiliationName": "Syngenta, Jealott's Hill International Research Centre"}}}
