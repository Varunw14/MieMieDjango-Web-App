However its current use is restricted to specific scenarios, namely in the diagnosis refractory focal epilepsies where electroencephalography (EEG) has been inconclusive. This review highlights the recent progress of MEG within epilepsy, including advances in the technique itself such as simultaneous EEG/MEG and intracranial EEG/MEG recording and room temperature MEG recording using optically pumped magnetometers, as well as improved post processing of the data during interictal and ictal activity for accurate source localisation of the epileptogenic focus. These advances should broaden the scope of MEG as an important part of epilepsy diagnostics in the future.", "AuthorKeywords": ["electroencephalograph", "magnetoencephalography", "OPMs", "source localisation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Drug Resistant Epilepsy", "Electrocorticography", "Electroencephalography", "Epilepsies, Partial", "Epilepsy", "Humans", "Medical History Taking"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092784435", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"34973665100": {"Name": "Vivekananda U.", "AuthorID": "34973665100", "AffiliationID": "124982322", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, Institute of Neurology, Queen Square, UCL"}}}
