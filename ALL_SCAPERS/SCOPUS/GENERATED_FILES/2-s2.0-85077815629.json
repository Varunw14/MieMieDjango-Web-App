If keep the designed width and depth of the slit in accordance with the focusing effect unchanged, when the incident wavelength changes, the focal position must change accordingly, and the dispersion effect is significant. In order to achieve the achromatic effect, the refractive index of the surrounding medium is changed while changing the wavelength. Finally, the refractive index of the surrounding medium which can keep the focal length constant at the wavelength of 1550-1950nm is obtained, and the equation that the change of the refractive index and the wavelength of the medium makes the focal length constant is obtained. The achromatic effect can be effectively achieved, and applications range of achromatic metalens from imaging in optical communications to telescopes in the astronomical field.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Achromatic", "Dielectric refractive index", "Focal length", "Metalens", "Nanoarray structure"], "IndexKeywords": ["Achromatic", "Dispersion effect", "Focal lengths", "Incident wavelength", "MetaLens", "Nanoarray structure", "Silicon waveguide", "Subwavelength slits"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077815629", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57210391800": {"Name": "Xie W.", "AuthorID": "57210391800", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "Center of Material Science, National University of Defense and Technology"}, "16023467700": {"Name": "Yang J.", "AuthorID": "16023467700", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "Center of Material Science, National University of Defense and Technology"}, "57013633200": {"Name": "Chen D.", "AuthorID": "57013633200", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "Center of Material Science, National University of Defense and Technology"}, "56518336500": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "56518336500", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "Center of Material Science, National University of Defense and Technology"}, "57197772732": {"Name": "Zhang Z.", "AuthorID": "57197772732", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "Center of Material Science, National University of Defense and Technology"}, "57202129877": {"Name": "Xu S.", "AuthorID": "57202129877", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "Center of Material Science, National University of Defense and Technology"}}}
