Yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood, partly because findings have largely been considered in isolation. Here, we review mechanistic pathways for which there is accumulating evidence and propose an integrative systems-biology framework for understanding neurological risk. Drawing upon work from other vascular beds in SCD, as well as the wider stroke literature, we propose that macro-circulatory hyper-perfusion, regions of relative micro-circulatory hypo-perfusion, and an exhaustion of cerebral reserve mechanisms, together lead to a state of cerebral vascular instability. We suggest that in this state, tissue oxygen supply is fragile and easily perturbed by changes in clinical condition, with the potential for stroke and/or microstructural injury if metabolic demand exceeds tissue oxygenation. This framework brings together recent developments in the field, highlights outstanding questions, and offers a first step toward a linking pathophysiological explanation of neurological risk that may help inform future screening and treatment strategies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anemia", "Cerebral hemodynamics", "Cerebrovascular reserve", "Oxygen extraction fraction", "Sickle cell disease", "Silent cerebral infarction", "Stroke", "Vascular instability"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071722115", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57196455905": {"Name": "Stotesbury H.", "AuthorID": "57196455905", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neurosciences, UCL Great Ormond Institute of Child Health"}, "55444368100": {"Name": "Kawadler J.M.", "AuthorID": "55444368100", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neurosciences, UCL Great Ormond Institute of Child Health"}, "6701651127": {"Name": "Hales P.W.", "AuthorID": "6701651127", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neurosciences, UCL Great Ormond Institute of Child Health"}, "7202074854": {"Name": "Saunders D.E.", "AuthorID": "7202074854", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Great Ormond Hospital"}, "55290679000": {"Name": "Clark C.A.", "AuthorID": "55290679000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neurosciences, UCL Great Ormond Institute of Child Health"}, "26643012600": {"Name": "Kirkham F.J.", "AuthorID": "26643012600", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology, Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
