Some of these compounds are currently being developed for the treatment of human cancers. We have previously developed a substituted naphthalene diimide G4-binding molecule (CM03) with selective potency for pancreatic cancer cells, including gemcitabine-resistant cells. We report here that CM03 and the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor SAHA (suberanilohydroxamic acid) have synergistic effects at concentrations close to and below their individual GI50 values, in both gemcitabine-sensitive and resistant pancreatic cancer cell lines. Immunoblot analysis showed elevated levels of \u03b3-H2AX and cleaved PARP proteins upon drug combination treatment, indicating increased levels of DNA damage (double-strand break events: DSBs) and apoptosis induction, respectively. We propose that the mechanism of synergy involves SAHA relaxing condensed chromatin, resulting in higher levels of G4 formation. In turn, CM03 can stabilise a greater number of G4s, leading to the downregulation of more G4-containing genes as well as a higher incidence of DSBs due to torsional strain on DNA and chromatin structure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CM03", "drug synergy", "gemcitabine resistance", "histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor vorinostat", "naphthalene diimide derivative", "pancreatic cancer", "quadruplex"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096739991", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Chemistry (miscellaneous)", "CHEM", "1601"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"57201287173": {"Name": "Ahmed A.A.", "AuthorID": "57201287173", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "35820006900": {"Name": "Neidle S.", "AuthorID": "35820006900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University College London"}}}
