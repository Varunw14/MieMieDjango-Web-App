Methods: Women who were at least six months overdue for cervical screening in three general practice surgeries in a deprived East London borough were identified from practice records. Staff sent batches of text messages informing women that they were overdue for screening, and inviting them to download an app to book their appointment. Results: Across the three practices, 2632 eligible women were identified. Valid mobile phone numbers were available for 1465 women. One woman had opted out of receiving text messages, so messages were sent to 1464 women. Of these, 158 (11%) booked a screening appointment within five months. The majority of these women booked without using the app (72%; 113/158); just over a quarter booked via the app (28%; 45/158). Conclusions: Just over 10% of cervical screening non-attenders booked an appointment in response to a text message with a link to a downloadable app; however, only one in four of these women booked using the app. This suggests that the text message reminder was likely to have been the key \u2018active ingredient\u2019 for most women, rather than the app itself. Future research could explore the optimal message for a text reminder in this context and evaluate the inclusion of a link to existing online booking systems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["behavioural interventions", "Cancer screening", "digital health", "primary care", "screening uptake", "text message reminders"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073923381", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57208719314": {"Name": "Ryan M.", "AuthorID": "57208719314", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, UCL"}, "6508131110": {"Name": "Marlow L.", "AuthorID": "6508131110", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, UCL"}, "16300728600": {"Name": "Forster A.", "AuthorID": "16300728600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, UCL"}, "57191898211": {"Name": "Waller J.", "AuthorID": "57191898211", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, UCL"}, "35811271600": {"Name": "Ruwende J.", "AuthorID": "35811271600", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "NHS England (London Region)/Public Health England"}}}
