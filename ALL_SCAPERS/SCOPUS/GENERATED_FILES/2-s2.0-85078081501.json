All 5570 Brazilian municipalities were included. The North and Center-West regions presented the lowest coverages of the first and second doses of MCV, respectively. We found significant associations of both first and second doses of MCV with population size, coverage of Family Health Strategy (FHS) and other indicators of living conditions and inequalities. Monitoring the homogeneity of MCV coverage at national, regional and state levels is essential, as it allows identifying areas at higher risk of measles spread that should be targeted for vaccination. Targeting large cities i.e. 100,000 or more inhabitants, especially poor neighborhoods and areas with low FHS coverage, could lead to improvements in coverage homogeneity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brazil", "Measles", "Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine", "Public Health", "Vaccination coverage"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078081501", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Veterinary (all)", "VETE", "3400"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57203515877": {"Name": "Pacheco F.", "AuthorID": "57203515877", "AffiliationID": "60017931", "AffiliationName": "Secretariat of Health Surveillance, Ministry of Health"}, "15519212600": {"Name": "Fran\u00e7a G.", "AuthorID": "15519212600", "AffiliationID": "60017931", "AffiliationName": "Secretariat of Health Surveillance, Ministry of Health"}, "57205448228": {"Name": "Elidio G.", "AuthorID": "57205448228", "AffiliationID": "60017931", "AffiliationName": "Secretariat of Health Surveillance, Ministry of Health"}, "7004464536": {"Name": "Guilhem D.", "AuthorID": "7004464536", "AffiliationID": "60024989", "AffiliationName": "Post-Graduation Program in Health Sciences, University of Bras\u00edlia"}, "57204520324": {"Name": "Leal M.", "AuthorID": "57204520324", "AffiliationID": "60017931", "AffiliationName": "Secretariat of Health Care, Ministry of Health"}, "7102223177": {"Name": "de Oliveira C.", "AuthorID": "7102223177", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
