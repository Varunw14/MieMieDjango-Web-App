The aim of this study is to investigate whether home TPN was associated with long-term survival and to assess the indications, duration and complications of TPN in patients with advanced SI-NENs. Patients with advanced SI-NENs who received home TPN were retrospectively included. Electronic records were reviewed for clinical information. Five patients receiving home TPN were identified out of 1011 patients with SI-NENs in our center. The median duration of TPN administration was 12 mo. Small bowel obstruction was the most common reason for TPN initiation. TPN-related complications included two catheter infections, one thrombosis and one episode of TPN-related transaminitis. At the last follow-up, three patients had died and two were alive. The median survival was 12 mo. Overall estimated 1-yr probability of survival on home TPN by Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis was 40%. In conclusion, home TPN may be a treatment option in highly selected advanced SI-NEN patients with severe gastrointestinal tract dysfunction. The initiation of home TPN is associated with long-term survival (\u22651 yr), and complication rates appear acceptable.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089982837", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"57192394290": {"Name": "Liu M.", "AuthorID": "57192394290", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "55961896300": {"Name": "Laskaratos F.M.", "AuthorID": "55961896300", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Neuroendocrine Tumour Unit, Centre for Gastroenterology, ENETS Centre of Excellence, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "16033469000": {"Name": "Toumpanakis C.", "AuthorID": "16033469000", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Neuroendocrine Tumour Unit, Centre for Gastroenterology, ENETS Centre of Excellence, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55649892900": {"Name": "Mandair D.", "AuthorID": "55649892900", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Neuroendocrine Tumour Unit, Centre for Gastroenterology, ENETS Centre of Excellence, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55908628800": {"Name": "Caplin M.", "AuthorID": "55908628800", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Neuroendocrine Tumour Unit, Centre for Gastroenterology, ENETS Centre of Excellence, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57201262960": {"Name": "Chen J.", "AuthorID": "57201262960", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "55756956900": {"Name": "Bennell J.", "AuthorID": "55756956900", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
