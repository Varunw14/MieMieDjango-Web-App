We conducted a systematic review to assess whether key study design and execution features contributed to earlier identification of patients with TB and decreased pre-treatment loss to follow-up, thereby reducing the potential impact of Xpert MTB/RIF testing. Methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Scopus for literature published from 1 st January 2009 to February 2019. We included all primary intervention studies that had evaluated the effect of Xpert MTB/RIF on mortality compared to usual care in participants with presumptive pulmonary TB. We critically reviewed features of included studies across: Study setting and context, Study population, Participant recruitment and enrolment, Study procedures, and Study follow-up. Results: We included seven randomised and one non-randomised study. All included studies demonstrated relative reductions in overall mortality in the Xpert MTB/RIF arm ranging from 6% to 40%. However, mortality reduction was reported to be statistically significant in two studies. Study features that could explain the lack of observed effect on mortality included: the higher quality of care at study sites; inclusion of patients with a higher pre-test probability of TB leading to higher than expected empirical rates; performance of additional diagnostic testing not done in usual care leading to increased TB diagnosis or empiric treatment initiation; the recruitment of participants likely to return for follow-up; and involvement of study staff in ensuring adherence with care and follow-up. Conclusion: Most studies of Xpert MTB/RIF were designed and conducted in a manner that resulted in more patients being diagnosed and treated for TB, minimising the potential difference in mortality Xpert MTB/RIF testing could have achieved compared to usual care.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diagnostic trials", "Impact studies", "Methodology", "Tuberculosis diagnosis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091183048", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"54417705400": {"Name": "Ochodo E.A.", "AuthorID": "54417705400", "AffiliationID": "60001565", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health, Stellenbosch University"}, "12239527700": {"Name": "Young T.", "AuthorID": "12239527700", "AffiliationID": "60001565", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health, Stellenbosch University"}, "36989307100": {"Name": "Kalema N.", "AuthorID": "36989307100", "AffiliationID": "60071676", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Diseases Institute, Makerere University"}, "39062036900": {"Name": "Schumacher S.", "AuthorID": "39062036900", "AffiliationID": "60100870", "AffiliationName": "Tuberculosis Department, Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics"}, "8438524800": {"Name": "Steingart K.", "AuthorID": "8438524800", "AffiliationID": "60020934", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Sciences, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"}, "57189234864": {"Name": "Mallett S.", "AuthorID": "57189234864", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Test Evaluation Research Group, Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham"}, "7006087510": {"Name": "Deeks J.", "AuthorID": "7006087510", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Test Evaluation Research Group, Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham"}, "7004225016": {"Name": "Cobelens F.", "AuthorID": "7004225016", "AffiliationID": "60138854, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development, Amsterdam University Medical Centers"}, "36041769200": {"Name": "Bossuyt P.M.", "AuthorID": "36041769200", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Deapartment of Clinical Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Amsterdam University Medical Centers"}, "9242829600": {"Name": "Nicol M.P.", "AuthorID": "9242829600", "AffiliationID": "60031806, 60009834", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Western Australia"}, "6507176526": {"Name": "Cattamanchi A.", "AuthorID": "6507176526", "AffiliationID": "60017805", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of California San Francisco Medical Center"}}}
