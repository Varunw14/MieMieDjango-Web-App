In this study, we report the changing trends in the population-level incidence of CAD and PAD, respectively from 2006 to 2015, statin utilization for secondary prevention and survival outcomes using multiple nationally representative data sources from the UK (primary care encounters, hospital admissions, and procedure-level data). Methods and results: A nationally representative study of linked primary and secondary care electronic health records of 4.6 million individuals from the UK. We calculated crude and standardized annual incidence rates separately for CAD and PAD. Statin use for secondary prevention, trends in annual major vascular event rates, and mortality between 2006 and 2015, were estimated for CAD and PAD, respectively. We identified 160 376 and 70 753 patients with incident CAD and PAD, respectively. The age- A nd sex-standardized incidence of CAD was similar in 2006 (443 per 100 000 person-years) and 2015 [436 per 100 000 person-years; adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96-1.00]. In contrast, there was a 15% decline in the standardized incidence of PAD (236 per 100 000 person-years in 2006 to 202 per 100 000 person-years in 2015; adjusted IRR 0.85, 95% CI 0.82-0.88). The proportion of incident CAD and PAD patients prescribed long-term statins, was only 66% and 55%, respectively and was less common amongst women, patients aged >70 years, with heart failure, chronic lung disease, or depression. Cardiovascular mortality declined by 43% for incident CAD (adjusted IRR 0.57, 95% CI 0.50-0.64) between 2006 and 2015 but did not decline for incident PAD (adjusted IRR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70-1.00). Conclusion and relevance: In the UK, the standardized incidence of CAD appears stable but mortality rates are falling, whereas the standardized incidence of PAD is falling but mortality rates are not.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coronary artery disease", "CV mortality", "Incidence", "Nationally representative health records", "Peripheral artery disease", "Statins"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078981032", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"24336599800": {"Name": "Sundaram V.", "AuthorID": "24336599800", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Population Health, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "7402652750": {"Name": "Simon D.I.", "AuthorID": "7402652750", "AffiliationID": "60021578, 60006404", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Harrington Heart and Vascular Institute, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine"}, "7103019569": {"Name": "Rajagopalan S.", "AuthorID": "7103019569", "AffiliationID": "60021578, 60006404", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Harrington Heart and Vascular Institute, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine"}, "55372161700": {"Name": "Bloom C.", "AuthorID": "55372161700", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Population Health, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "8726666700": {"Name": "Zakeri R.", "AuthorID": "8726666700", "AffiliationID": "60022023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Royal Brompton and Harefield Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7202164137": {"Name": "Cleland J.G.F.", "AuthorID": "7202164137", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Robertson Centre for Biostatistics and Clinical Trials, University of Glasgow"}, "16507541000": {"Name": "Quint J.K.", "AuthorID": "16507541000", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "6603008454": {"Name": "Halcox J.", "AuthorID": "6603008454", "AffiliationID": "60170471", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Swansea University Medical School"}, "55465458700": {"Name": "Cohen A.", "AuthorID": "55465458700", "AffiliationID": "60005518, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hematological Medicine, Guys and St Thomas NHS Foundation Trust, King's College London"}, "36150391800": {"Name": "Bowrin K.", "AuthorID": "36150391800", "AffiliationID": "60099556", "AffiliationName": "Bayer Plc"}, "56637872500": {"Name": "Briere J.B.", "AuthorID": "56637872500", "AffiliationID": "60006680", "AffiliationName": "Bayer AG"}, "57208560645": {"Name": "Banerjee A.", "AuthorID": "57208560645", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}}}
