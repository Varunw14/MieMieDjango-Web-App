Regression models were used to predict a Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) score (range 0\u201340) with higher values indicating worse mental health. Ethnic density was operationalised using two distinct measures: co-ethnic density and diversity index. There was no difference in the mental health of ethnic minority youths by whether they lived in neighbourhoods of differing levels of ethnic density or neighbourhood deprivation. White British youths had poorer mental health when living in deprived neighbourhoods where their ethnic group was the vast majority. The difference compared to all other neighbourhoods was two points on the SDQ score. Interventions should seek to encourage adolescents living in white-working class neighbourhoods to explore ethnic diversity to determine whether it improves their mental health.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adolescent mental health", "Ethnic density", "Ethnic diversity", "Neighbourhood deprivation", "UKHLS"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Censuses", "Child", "Child Welfare", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "England", "Ethnic Groups", "European Continental Ancestry Group", "Family Characteristics", "Female", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Mental Health", "Minority Groups", "Residence Characteristics", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077174559", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["History and Philosophy of Science", "ARTS", "1207"]], "AuthorData": {"57212591447": {"Name": "Jun J.", "AuthorID": "57212591447", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, UCL"}, "36554360000": {"Name": "Jivraj S.", "AuthorID": "36554360000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, UCL"}, "57212593189": {"Name": "Taylor K.", "AuthorID": "57212593189", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, UCL"}}}
