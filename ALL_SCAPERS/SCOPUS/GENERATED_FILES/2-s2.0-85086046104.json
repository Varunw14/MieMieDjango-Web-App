Using data from a prospective cohort study (AYAZAZI) of youth aged 16\u201324 years in Durban, South Africa, we assessed the STI care cascade across participant diagnosis, STI treatment, partner notification, and partner treatment; index recurrent STI and associated factors; and reasons for not notifying partner of STI. Participants completed laboratory-based STI screening (Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Trichomonas vaginalis) at enrollment and at 12 months. Of the 37/216 participants with STI (17%), 27/37 (73%) were women and 10/37 (27%) were men. Median age was 19 years (IQR: 18\u201320). Of the participants with STI, 23/37 (62%) completed a Treatment and Partner Tracing Survey within 6 months of diagnosis. All survey participants reported completing STI treatment (100%), 17/23 (74%) notified a partner, and 6/23 (35%) reported partner treatment. Overall, 4/23 (11%) participants had 12-month recurrent C. trachomatis infection, with no association with partner notification or treatment. Stigma and lack of STI knowledge were reasons for not notifying partner of STI. STI partner notification and treatment is a challenge among youth. Novel strategies are needed to overcome barriers along the STI care cascade.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Africa", "Chlamydia (Chlamydia trachomatis)", "gonorrhea (Neisseria gonorrhoeae)", "prevention", "sexual behavior"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Chlamydia Infections", "Chlamydia trachomatis", "Contact Tracing", "Female", "Gonorrhea", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "Male", "Neisseria gonorrhoeae", "Prospective Studies", "Sexual Partners", "Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "Social Stigma", "South Africa", "Treatment Outcome", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086046104", "SubjectAreas": [["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57189074755": {"Name": "Chitneni P.", "AuthorID": "57189074755", "AffiliationID": "60029929", "AffiliationName": "Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital combined Infectious Diseases Fellowship"}, "6701588631": {"Name": "Beksinska M.", "AuthorID": "6701588631", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "Maternal Adolescent and Child Health (MatCH) Research Unit (MRU), Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand"}, "54795263800": {"Name": "Jaggernath M.", "AuthorID": "54795263800", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "Maternal Adolescent and Child Health (MatCH) Research Unit (MRU), Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand"}, "35601488200": {"Name": "Smit J.", "AuthorID": "35601488200", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "Maternal Adolescent and Child Health (MatCH) Research Unit (MRU), Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand"}, "35174230300": {"Name": "Dietrich J.J.", "AuthorID": "35174230300", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "Perinatal HIV Research Unit (PHRU), Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand"}, "57203557626": {"Name": "Gray G.", "AuthorID": "57203557626", "AffiliationID": "60028973", "AffiliationName": "South African Medical Research Council, Cape Town"}, "57189869193": {"Name": "Closson K.", "AuthorID": "57189869193", "AffiliationID": "60018491", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser University"}, "57204097994": {"Name": "Smith P.", "AuthorID": "57204097994", "AffiliationID": "60018491", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser University"}, "57205917641": {"Name": "Brockman M.", "AuthorID": "57205917641", "AffiliationID": "60018491", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser University"}, "15048041200": {"Name": "Kaida A.", "AuthorID": "15048041200", "AffiliationID": "60018491", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser University"}, "55742511200": {"Name": "Lewis D.A.", "AuthorID": "55742511200", "AffiliationID": "60000356, 60010932", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medical Virology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town"}, "26428329200": {"Name": "Matthews L.T.", "AuthorID": "26428329200", "AffiliationID": "60027086", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Alabama at Birmingham"}, "57204021682": {"Name": "Ndung\u2019u T.", "AuthorID": "57204021682", "AffiliationID": "60022344", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
