In the Western Volcanic Zone, Iceland, through detailed field mapping and field measurements of fault throws, normal faults are mapped and along-strike throw profiles are constructed in order to understand how the throw-rates relate with the local fault geometry along faults at different stages of linkage. The results show that throw-rates increase within linkage zones and propagating fault bends independently from the stage of maturity of the fault bend. This implies that 1) the relationship between the local fault geometry and the along-strike distribution of throw-rate is driven by the deeper part of the fault, where established fault bends start propagating to the surface; 2) faults grow first by linkage and coalescence of separate faults, and then by accumulation of slip on the resultant fault, in agreement with models of fault growth by linkage and coalescence; 3) incipient fault bends can produce uncertainty associated with palaeoseismological results, if fault bends remain unrecognised. Moreover, this work demonstrates that existing models showing increased co-seismic and throw-rates within fault bends and sites of fault linkage found in continental extensional settings are valid in a geodynamic context of a mid-oceanic rifts.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Different stages", "Field mapping", "Field measurement", "Incipient faults", "Local faults", "Normal faults", "Rate variation", "Volcanic zone"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078244212", "SubjectAreas": [["Geology", "EART", "1907"]], "AuthorData": {"56419852600": {"Name": "Iezzi F.", "AuthorID": "56419852600", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "7403399232": {"Name": "Roberts G.", "AuthorID": "7403399232", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "57209001704": {"Name": "Faure Walker J.", "AuthorID": "57209001704", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, University College London"}}}
