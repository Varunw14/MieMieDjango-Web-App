However, some amphibians can be infected with B. dendrobatidis in the absence of disease and can act as reservoirs of the pathogen.We surveyed robber frogs (Eleutherodactylus spp.), potential B. dendrobatidis reservoir species, at three sites on Montserrat, 2011-2013, and on Dominica in 2014, to identify seasonal patterns in B. dendrobatidis infection prevalence and load (B. dendrobatidis genomic equivalents). On Montserrat there was significant seasonality in B. dendrobatidis prevalence and B. dendrobatidis load, both of which were correlated with temperature but not rainfall. B. dendrobatidis prevalence reached 35% in the cooler, driermonths but was repeatedly undetectable during the warmer, wetter months. Also, B. dendrobatidis prevalence significantly decreased from 53.2% when the pathogen emerged onMontserrat in 2009 to a maximum 34.8% by 2011, after which it remained stable. On Dominica, where B. dendrobatidis emerged seven years prior to Montserrat, the same seasonal pattern was recorded but at lower prevalence, possibly indicating long-term decline. Understanding the dynamics of disease threats such as chytridiomycosis is key to planning conservation measures. For example, reintroductions of chytridiomycosisthreatened species could be timed to coincide with periods of low B. dendrobatidis infection risk, increasing potential for reintroduction success.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amphibians", "Caribbean herpetology", "Chytridiomycosis", "Conservation", "Disease dynamics", "Pathogen reservoirs", "Wildlife disease"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074142011", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"55656978900": {"Name": "Hudson M.A.", "AuthorID": "55656978900", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Durrell Insitute of Conservation and Ecology, School of Anthropology and Conservation, University of Kent"}, "56385295500": {"Name": "Blackman A.", "AuthorID": "56385295500", "AffiliationID": "60009498", "AffiliationName": "Zoological Society of London"}, "15045436600": {"Name": "Perkins M.W.", "AuthorID": "15045436600", "AffiliationID": "60009498", "AffiliationName": "Zoological Society of London"}, "37049441000": {"Name": "Tapley B.", "AuthorID": "37049441000", "AffiliationID": "60009498", "AffiliationName": "Zoological Society of London"}, "57203051586": {"Name": "Cunningham A.A.", "AuthorID": "57203051586", "AffiliationID": "60009498", "AffiliationName": "Zoological Society of London"}, "57040448300": {"Name": "Adams S.L.", "AuthorID": "57040448300", "AffiliationID": "60030656", "AffiliationName": "Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust"}, "14720492700": {"Name": "Young R.P.", "AuthorID": "14720492700", "AffiliationID": "60030656", "AffiliationName": "Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust"}, "57220607253": {"Name": "Griffiths R.A.", "AuthorID": "57220607253", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Durrell Insitute of Conservation and Ecology, School of Anthropology and Conservation, University of Kent"}, "57040318500": {"Name": "Martin L.", "AuthorID": "57040318500", "AffiliationID": "123374053", "AffiliationName": "Department of Environment, Ministry of Agriculture, Housing, Lands and Environment"}, "7006233991": {"Name": "Fenton C.", "AuthorID": "7006233991", "AffiliationID": "123374053", "AffiliationName": "Department of Environment, Ministry of Agriculture, Housing, Lands and Environment"}, "56386138800": {"Name": "Sulton M.", "AuthorID": "56386138800", "AffiliationID": "123374010", "AffiliationName": "Wildlife and Parks Division, Ministry of Environment Disaster Management and Urban Renewal, Roseau, Commonwealth of Dominica"}, "55932733800": {"Name": "Lopez J.", "AuthorID": "55932733800", "AffiliationID": "60109277", "AffiliationName": "Chester Zoo, Upton by Chester"}, "22934092100": {"Name": "Garcia G.", "AuthorID": "22934092100", "AffiliationID": "60109277", "AffiliationName": "Chester Zoo, Upton by Chester"}}}
