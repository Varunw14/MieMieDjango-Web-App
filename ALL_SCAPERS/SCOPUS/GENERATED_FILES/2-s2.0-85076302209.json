Notwithstanding this feat, household electricity consumption, particularly in rural areas, remains significantly low. Thus, stimulating demand and sustainable consumption are the next critical challenges policymakers face. In this paper, we present a case study of an electrification project that targets workers\u2019 housing inside a commercial tea estate. We use Energy Cultures framework to analyse what motivates and constrains household electricity consumption in rural Kenya. Our findings show that although people give significant consideration to cost, money is not the only determinant. Electricity is desired to the extent that it enables families to carry out socially desirable activities, while service is measured against expectations and aspirations. Although access to the grid influences households\u2019 perceptions of wellbeing, their status as migrant workers has a constraining effect on how they consume electricity. Empowered by technology, households are also increasingly taking charge in shaping their own distinct energy cultures. However, for the most part, this involves finding new ways to reproduce and sustain a way of life that is consistent with their belief systems. Seeing households as embodiments of lifestyles whose energy culture is shaped by their on-going interactions with their physical and social environments, the paper argues for an integrated approach to policy and programmatic interventions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Africa", "Electricity consumption", "Energy culture", "Household", "Kenya", "Rural electrification"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076302209", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Nuclear Energy and Engineering", "ENER", "2104"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"]], "AuthorData": {"57212244070": {"Name": "Tesfamichael M.", "AuthorID": "57212244070", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Science, Engineering, Technology and Public Policy, University College London"}, "57212247488": {"Name": "Bastille C.", "AuthorID": "57212247488", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Environment and Sustainability, Faculty of Engineering and Physical Science, University of Surrey"}, "57212242767": {"Name": "Leach M.", "AuthorID": "57212242767", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Environment and Sustainability, Faculty of Engineering and Physical Science, University of Surrey"}}}
