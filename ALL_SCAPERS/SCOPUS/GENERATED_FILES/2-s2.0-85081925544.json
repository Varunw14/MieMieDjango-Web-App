Oncol.", "Volume": "157", "Issue": 2, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 500, "PageEnd": 507, "CitedBy": 6, "DOI": "10.1016/j.ygyno.2020.02.030", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85081925544&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2020Background: Olaparib was approved on December 19, 2014 by the US FDA as 4th-line therapy (and beyond) for patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations; rucaparib was approved on December 19, 2016 as 3rd-line therapy (and beyond) for germline or somatic BRCA1/2-mutated recurrent disease. On October 23, 2019, niraparib was approved for treatment of women with damaging mutations in BRCA1/2 or other homologous recombination repair genes who had been treated with three or more prior regimens. We compared the cost-effectiveness of PARPi(s) with intravenous regimens for platinum-resistant disease. Methods: Median progression-free survival (PFS) and toxicity data from regulatory trials were incorporated in a model which transitioned patients through response, hematologic complications, non-hematologic complications, progression, and death. Using TreeAge Pro 2017, each PARPi(s) was compared separately to non\u2011platinum-based and bevacizumab-containing regimens. Costs of IV drugs, managing toxicities, infusions, and supportive care were estimated using 2017 Medicare data. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated and PFS was reported in quality adjusted life months for platinum-resistant populations. Results: Non\u2011platinum-based intravenous chemotherapy was most cost effective ($6,412/PFS-month) compared with bevacizumab-containing regimens ($12,187/PFS-month), niraparib ($18,970/PFS-month), olaparib ($16,327/PFS-month), and rucaparib ($16,637/PFS-month). ICERs for PARPi(s) were 3\u20133.5\u00d7 times greater than intravenous non\u2011platinum-based regimens. Conclusion: High costs of orally administered PARPi(s) were not mitigated or balanced by costs of infusion and managing toxicities of intravenous regimens typically associated with lower response and shorter median PFS. Balancing modest clinical benefit with costs of novel therapies remains problematic and could widen disparities among those with limited access to care.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Oral", "Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Bevacizumab", "Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Drug Costs", "Female", "Humans", "Indazoles", "Indoles", "Infusions, Intravenous", "Markov Chains", "Models, Statistical", "Neoplasm Recurrence, Local", "Ovarian Neoplasms", "Phthalazines", "Piperazines", "Piperidines", "Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors", "Quality of Life", "United States"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081925544", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"56719374800": {"Name": "Wolford J.E.", "AuthorID": "56719374800", "AffiliationID": "60007278", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gynecologic Oncology, University of California"}, "7004916000": {"Name": "Tewari K.S.", "AuthorID": "7004916000", "AffiliationID": "60007278", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gynecologic Oncology, University of California"}, "56565914400": {"Name": "Bai J.", "AuthorID": "56565914400", "AffiliationID": "60116537", "AffiliationName": "School of Business, Wake Forest University"}, "35299966500": {"Name": "Moore K.N.", "AuthorID": "35299966500", "AffiliationID": "60030931", "AffiliationName": "Stephenson Cancer Center at the University of Oklahoma"}, "8771515300": {"Name": "Kristeleit R.", "AuthorID": "8771515300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Cancer Institute"}, "7005780295": {"Name": "Monk B.J.", "AuthorID": "7005780295", "AffiliationID": "60020301", "AffiliationName": "University of Arizona Cancer Center"}}}
