Systemic sclerosis is classified into limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis and diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis subgroups based on the extent of skin involvement. Randomized controlled trials in scleroderma have mainly focused on diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis partly because the measurement of skin involvement, critical for evaluating a therapeutic intervention, is more dynamic in this subset. Nonetheless, limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis, the most common cutaneous subset (about two-third), is also associated with significant morbidity and detrimental impact on health-related quality of life. The lack of interventional studies in limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis is partly due to a lack of relevant outcome measures to evaluate this subgroup. Combining several clinically meaningful outcomes selected specifically for limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis may improve representativeness in clinical trials and responsiveness of outcomes measured in randomized controlled trials. A composite index dedicated to limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis combining such relevant outcomes could advance clinical trial development for limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis by providing the opportunity to test and select among candidate drugs that could act as disease-modifying treatments for this neglected subgroup of systemic sclerosis. This proposed index would include items selected by expert physicians and patients with limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis across domains grounded in the lived experience of limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis. This article reviews the reasons behind the relative neglect of limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis, discusses the current state of outcome measures for limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis, identifies challenges, and proposes a roadmap for a combined limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis-specific treatment response index.", "AuthorKeywords": ["classifications", "combined response index", "composite score", "limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis", "quality of life", "scleroderma", "Systemic sclerosis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092137488", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"55354866400": {"Name": "Lescoat A.", "AuthorID": "55354866400", "AffiliationID": "60028893", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Immunology, Rennes University Hospital"}, "57219306567": {"Name": "Zimmermann F.", "AuthorID": "57219306567", "AffiliationID": "60028893", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Immunology, Rennes University Hospital"}, "55341289100": {"Name": "Murphy S.L.", "AuthorID": "55341289100", "AffiliationID": "60105937", "AffiliationName": "VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, GRECC"}, "57217879725": {"Name": "Roofeh D.", "AuthorID": "57217879725", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Scleroderma Program, Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan"}, "57219319556": {"Name": "Wessel R.", "AuthorID": "57219319556", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Scleroderma Program, Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan"}, "24066781200": {"Name": "Khanna D.", "AuthorID": "24066781200", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Scleroderma Program, Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan"}, "24759261700": {"Name": "Pauling J.D.", "AuthorID": "24759261700", "AffiliationID": "60000080, 60017238", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases (at Royal United Hospitals)"}, "57210547929": {"Name": "Hughes M.", "AuthorID": "57210547929", "AffiliationID": "60006444, 60024453", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57210830880": {"Name": "Sandler R.", "AuthorID": "57210830880", "AffiliationID": "60006444, 60024453", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "38863178400": {"Name": "Townsend W.", "AuthorID": "38863178400", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Taubman Health Sciences Library, University of Michigan"}, "57207967935": {"Name": "Chung L.", "AuthorID": "57207967935", "AffiliationID": "60028084", "AffiliationName": "Division of Immunology and Rheumatology, Palo Alto Health Care System"}, "7006031021": {"Name": "Denton C.P.", "AuthorID": "7006031021", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases, Royal Free Hospital Campus, University College London Medical School"}, "7005329470": {"Name": "Merkel P.A.", "AuthorID": "7005329470", "AffiliationID": "60006297", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Epidemiology, Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics, University of Pennsylvania"}, "7005011211": {"Name": "Steen V.", "AuthorID": "7005011211", "AffiliationID": "60021191", "AffiliationName": "Division of Rheumatology, Georgetown University Medical Center"}, "7003519327": {"Name": "Allanore Y.", "AuthorID": "7003519327", "AffiliationID": "60019163, 60123796, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, Cochin Hospital, AP-HP, Paris Descartes University"}, "57202944561": {"Name": "Del Galdo F.", "AuthorID": "57202944561", "AffiliationID": "60012070, 60170333", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Medicine and NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, University of Leeds"}, "57188997690": {"Name": "Godard D.", "AuthorID": "57188997690", "AffiliationID": "116586076", "AffiliationName": "Association des Scl\u00e9rodermie de France"}, "7102638119": {"Name": "Cella D.", "AuthorID": "7102638119", "AffiliationID": "60013227", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Social Sciences, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"}, "57204176754": {"Name": "Farrington S.", "AuthorID": "57204176754", "AffiliationID": "115933431", "AffiliationName": "Federation of European Scleroderma Associations (FESCA)"}, "7003995450": {"Name": "Buch M.H.", "AuthorID": "7003995450", "AffiliationID": "60120605, 60111801", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Manchester Biomedical Research Centre, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester University Foundation Trust"}}}
