Published by BMJ.Objective: To examine the prevalence of dysnatraemias among children admitted for paediatric surgery before and after a change from hypotonic to isotonic intravenous maintenance fluid therapy. Design: Retrospective consecutive time series intervention study. Setting: Paediatric surgery ward at the Children's Hospital in Lund, during a 7-year period, 2010-2017. Patients: All children with a blood sodium concentration measurement during the study period were included. Hypotonic maintenance fluid (40 mmol/L NaCl and 20 mmol/L KCl) was used during the first 3 years of the study (646 patients), and isotonic solution (140 mmol/L NaCl and 20 mmol/L KCl) was used during the following period (807 patients). Main outcome measures: Primary outcomes were sodium concentration and occurrence of hyponatraemia (<135 mmol/L) or hypernatraemia (>145 mmol/L). Results: Overall, the change from hypotonic to isotonic intravenous maintenance fluid therapy was associated with a decreased prevalence of hyponatraemia from 29% to 22% (adjusted OR 0.65 (0.51-0.82)) without a significantly increased odds for hypernatraemia (from 3.4% to 4.3%, adjusted OR 1.2 (0.71-2.1)). Hyponatraemia <130 mmol/L decreased from 6.2% to 2.6%, and hyponatraemia <125 mmol/L decreased from 2.0% to 0.5%. Conclusions: Routine use of intravenous isotonic maintenance fluids was associated with lower prevalence of hyponatraemia, although hyponatraemia still occurred in over 20% of patients. We propose that the composition and the volume of administered fluid need to be addressed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["general paediatrics", "nephrology", "paediatric surgery"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094950238", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"6603463904": {"Name": "Chromek M.", "AuthorID": "6603463904", "AffiliationID": "60019295, 60012311", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Nephrology, Karolinska Institute, Karolinska University Hospital"}, "57214680422": {"Name": "Jungner A.", "AuthorID": "57214680422", "AffiliationID": "60029170, 60014077", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Nephrology, Paediatric Surgery, Paediatric Intensive Care, and Neonatal Care, Lund University, Skane University Hospital"}, "57204970299": {"Name": "Rudolfson N.", "AuthorID": "57204970299", "AffiliationID": "60029170, 60014077", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Nephrology, Paediatric Surgery, Paediatric Intensive Care, and Neonatal Care, Lund University, Skane University Hospital"}, "56275157800": {"Name": "Ley D.", "AuthorID": "56275157800", "AffiliationID": "60029170, 60014077", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Nephrology, Paediatric Surgery, Paediatric Intensive Care, and Neonatal Care, Lund University, Skane University Hospital"}, "55189385600": {"Name": "Hagander L.", "AuthorID": "55189385600", "AffiliationID": "60029170, 60014077", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Nephrology, Paediatric Surgery, Paediatric Intensive Care, and Neonatal Care, Lund University, Skane University Hospital"}, "6602980434": {"Name": "Bockenhauer D.", "AuthorID": "6602980434", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Renal Medicine, Great Ormond Street Hospital, Children Nhs Foundation Trust"}}}
