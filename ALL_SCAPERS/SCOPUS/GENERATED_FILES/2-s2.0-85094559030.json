Widespread infrared variability is found across the population of 37 stars with two or more epochs. Larger flux changes occur on longer time-scales, reaching several tens of per cent over baselines of a few years. The canonical model of a geometrically thin, optically thick disc is thus insufficient, as it cannot give rise to the observed behaviour. Optically thin dust best accounts for the variability, where collisions drive dust production and destruction. Notably, the highest infrared variations are seen in systems that show Ca II emission, supporting planetesimal collisions for all known debris discs, with the most energetic occurring in those with detected gaseous debris. The sample includes the only polluted white dwarf with a circumbinary disc, where the signal of the day-night cycle of its irradiated substellar companion appears diluted by dust emission.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Circumstellar matter", "Planetary systems", "Stars: individual: SDSS J155720.77+091624.6", "White dwarfs"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094559030", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57205626086": {"Name": "Swan A.", "AuthorID": "57205626086", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department OfPhysics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57203394181": {"Name": "Farihi J.", "AuthorID": "57203394181", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department OfPhysics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57191980484": {"Name": "Wilson T.G.", "AuthorID": "57191980484", "AffiliationID": "60022132", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, University of St Andrews"}, "35796119800": {"Name": "Parsons S.G.", "AuthorID": "35796119800", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Sheffield"}}}
