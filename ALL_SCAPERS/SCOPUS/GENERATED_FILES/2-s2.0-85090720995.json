Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Oxidative stress is a key mediator in the development and progression of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). The antioxidant n-acetylcysteine (NAC) has generated interest as a disease-modifying therapy for PD but is limited due to poor bioavailability, a short half-life, and limited access to the brain. The aim of this study was to formulate and utilise mitochondria-targeted nanocarriers for delivery of NAC alone and in combination with the iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO), and assess their ability to protect against oxidative stress in a cellular rotenone PD model. Pluronic F68 (P68) and dequalinium (DQA) nanocarriers were prepared by a modified thin-film hydration method. An MTT assay assessed cell viability and iron status was measured using a ferrozine assay and ferritin immunoassay. For oxidative stress, a modified cellular antioxidant activity assay and the thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances assay and mitochondrial hydroxyl assay were utilised. Overall, this study demonstrates, for the first time, successful formulation of NAC and NAC + DFO into P68 + DQA nanocarriers for neuronal delivery. The results indicate that NAC and NAC + DFO nanocarriers have the potential characteristics to access the brain and that 1000 \u00b5M P68 + DQA NAC exhibited the strongest ability to protect against reduced cell viability (p = 0.0001), increased iron (p = 0.0033) and oxidative stress (p \u2264 0.0003). These NAC nanocarriers therefore demonstrate significant potential to be transitioned for further preclinical testing for PD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antioxidant capacity", "Deferoxamine", "Iron", "N-acetylcysteine", "Neurodegeneration", "Oxidative stress", "Parkinson\u2019s disease"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090720995", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"56593160900": {"Name": "Mursaleen L.", "AuthorID": "56593160900", "AffiliationID": "119965967", "AffiliationName": "The Cure Parkinson\u2019s Trust"}, "57218907225": {"Name": "Noble B.", "AuthorID": "57218907225", "AffiliationID": "60000508", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Sciences, University of Westminster"}, "18042756100": {"Name": "Zariwala M.G.", "AuthorID": "18042756100", "AffiliationID": "60000508", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Sciences, University of Westminster"}, "57218916293": {"Name": "Chan S.H.Y.", "AuthorID": "57218916293", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "8774245700": {"Name": "Somavarapu S.", "AuthorID": "8774245700", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy"}}}
