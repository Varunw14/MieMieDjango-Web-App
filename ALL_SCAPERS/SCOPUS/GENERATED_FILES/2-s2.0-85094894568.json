These in turn rapidly recruit neutrophils, which assist in limiting the spread of injury and removing cellular debris. Microglia continuously survey the CNS (central nervous system) compartment and identify structural abnormalities in neurons contributing to the response. After some days, when neutrophil numbers start to decline, activated microglia and astrocytes assemble at the injury site\u2014segregating injured tissue from healthy tissue and facilitating restorative processes. Monocytes infiltrate the injury site to produce chemokines that recruit astrocytes which successively extend their processes towards monocytes during the recovery phase. In this fashion, monocytes infiltration serves to help repair the injured brain. Neurons and astrocytes also moderate brain inflammation via downregulation of cytotoxic inflammation. Depending on the severity of the brain injury, T and B cells can also be recruited to the brain pathology sites at later time points.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cellular infiltration", "Microglial dynamics", "Neuroinflammation", "Traumatic brain injury"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094894568", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"57197329202": {"Name": "Alam A.", "AuthorID": "57197329202", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurosurgery, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge"}, "55669665400": {"Name": "Thelin E.P.", "AuthorID": "55669665400", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Karolinska University Hospital"}, "35304296600": {"Name": "Tajsic T.", "AuthorID": "35304296600", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurosurgery, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge"}, "57188871574": {"Name": "Khan D.Z.", "AuthorID": "57188871574", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurosurgery, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge"}, "57209182071": {"Name": "Khellaf A.", "AuthorID": "57209182071", "AffiliationID": "60017018, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Injury Prevention Research Office, Division of Neurosurgery, St. Michael\u2019s Hospital, University of Toronto"}, "57219722340": {"Name": "Helmy A.", "AuthorID": "57219722340", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurosurgery, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge"}, "16302224400": {"Name": "Patani R.", "AuthorID": "16302224400", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "The Francis Crick Institute"}}}
