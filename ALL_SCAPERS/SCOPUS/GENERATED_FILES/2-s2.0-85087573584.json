The pathophysiology of dystonia is not fully understood but loss of neuronal inhibition, excessive sensorimotor plasticity and defective sensory processing are thought to contribute to network dysfunction underlying the disorder. Neurophysiology studies have been important in furthering our understanding of dystonia and have provided insights into the mechanism of effective dystonia treatment with pallidal deep brain stimulation. In this article we review neurophysiology studies in dystonia and its treatment with Deep Brain Stimulation, including Transcranial magnetic stimulation studies, studies of reflexes and sensory processing, and oscillatory activity recordings including local field potentials, micro-recordings, EEG and evoked potentials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dystonia", "Gpi DBS", "Neurophysiology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087573584", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"8644218600": {"Name": "Tisch S.", "AuthorID": "8644218600", "AffiliationID": "60025702", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, St Vincent\u2019s Hospital"}, "7003880315": {"Name": "Limousin P.", "AuthorID": "7003880315", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}}}
