Given their separate roles in immune dysregulation, our objective was to characterise the impact that SCD has on the presentation and progression of paediatric HIV. Methods: The study was a retrospective cohort study (study period 2004\u20132018). Cases of HIV + and SCD-afflicted patients (HIV+/SCD+) were obtained via electronic chart review from a paediatric HIV clinic in Kampala, Uganda and matched 1:3 with HIV + controls without SCD (HIV+/SCD-). Results: Thirty-five HIV+/SCD + subjects and 95 HIV+/SCD- controls were analysed (39% female (51/130), age 3.6 years (SD3.9)). At baseline, WHO clinical stage (64% total cohort Stage III/IV) and nutritional status (9.4% severe acute malnutrition) were similar for both groups, whereas HIV+/SCD + had higher though non-significant baseline CD4 count (1036 (SD713) vs 849 (SD638) cells/microlitre, P = 0.20, two-tailed t-test). There were 19 deaths, 6 (17%) HIV+/SCD + and 13 (14%) HIV+/SCD-, with unadjusted/adjusted models showing no significant difference. Nutritional progression and clinical stage progression showed no significant differences between groups. Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis showed a slower rate of treatment failures in the HIV+/SCD + cohort (P = 0.11, log-rank survival test). Trajectory analysis showed that in the time period analysed, the HIV+/SCD + cohort showed a more rapid rise and higher total CD4 count (P = 0.012, regression analysis). Conclusion: The study suggests that SCD does not adversely affect the progression of HIV in patients on ART. Further, HIV+/SCD + achieved higher CD4 counts and fewer HIV treatment failures, suggesting physiological effects due to SCD might mitigate HIV progression.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Africa", "CD4", "HIV", "paediatric", "sickle cell disease", "Uganda"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Anemia, Sickle Cell", "Anti-HIV Agents", "CD4 Lymphocyte Count", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Disease Progression", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Survival Analysis", "Uganda"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084497622", "SubjectAreas": [["Parasitology", "IMMU", "2405"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57216742019": {"Name": "Ssenyondwa J.", "AuthorID": "57216742019", "AffiliationID": "124378719", "AffiliationName": "Texas Children\u2019s Hospital \u2013 Global HOPE Program"}, "57216744713": {"Name": "Kanywa J.B.", "AuthorID": "57216744713", "AffiliationID": "112639364", "AffiliationName": "Baylor College of Medicine Children\u2019s Foundation"}, "57216754549": {"Name": "Naturinda E.", "AuthorID": "57216754549", "AffiliationID": "124378719", "AffiliationName": "Texas Children\u2019s Hospital \u2013 Global HOPE Program"}, "14527998000": {"Name": "Wasswa P.L.M.", "AuthorID": "14527998000", "AffiliationID": "60002441, 60008978", "AffiliationName": "Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "16417420100": {"Name": "Lubega J.", "AuthorID": "16417420100", "AffiliationID": "60002441, 60008978", "AffiliationName": "Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "57118962100": {"Name": "George P.E.", "AuthorID": "57118962100", "AffiliationID": "60002441, 60008978", "AffiliationName": "Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "57214099433": {"Name": "Mercedes R.", "AuthorID": "57214099433", "AffiliationID": "60002441, 60008978", "AffiliationName": "Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "57188860648": {"Name": "Carlos Bazo-Alvarez J.", "AuthorID": "57188860648", "AffiliationID": "60109730", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n, Universidad Cat\u00f3lica Los Angeles de Chimbote"}}}
