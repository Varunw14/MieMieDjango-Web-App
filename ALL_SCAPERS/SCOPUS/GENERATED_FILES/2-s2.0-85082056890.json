Aims: To investigate whether NSAIDs reduce PCCRC risk after a negative baseline colonoscopy. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study based on a territory-wide healthcare database of Hong Kong. All patients (aged 40 or above) who underwent colonoscopies between 2005 and 2013 were identified. Exclusion criteria included CRC detected within 6 months of index colonoscopy, prior CRC, inflammatory bowel disease and prior colectomy. The primary outcome was PCCRC-3y diagnosed between 6 and 36 months after index colonoscopy. Sites of CRC were categorised as proximal (proximal to splenic flexure) and distal. The adjusted hazards ratio (aHR) of PCCRC-3y with NSAID and aspirin use (defined as cumulative use for \u226590 days within 5 years before index colonoscopy) was derived by propensity score (PS) regression adjustment of 22 covariates (including patient factors, concurrent medication use and endoscopy centre's performance). Results: Of 187 897 eligible patients, 21 757 (11.6%) were NSAID users. 854 (0.45%) developed PCCRC-3y (proximal cancer: 147 [17.2%]). NSAIDs were associated with a lower PCCRC-3y risk (aHR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.41-0.70), but not CRC that developed >3 years (aHR: 0.78, 95% CI 0.56-1.09). The aHR was 0.48 (95% CI: 0.24-0.95) for proximal and 0.55 (95% CI: 0.40-0.74) for distal cancer. A duration- and frequency response relationship was observed (Ptrend < 0.001). For aspirin, the aHR was 1.01 (95% CI: 0.80-1.28). Conclusions: Non-aspirin NSAIDs were associated with lower PCCRC risk after a negative baseline colonoscopy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adenocarcinoma", "colon cancer", "interval cancer", "NSAID", "post-colonoscopy colorectal cancer", "rectal cancer"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal", "Aspirin", "Cohort Studies", "Colectomy", "Colonoscopy", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Databases, Factual", "Female", "Hong Kong", "Humans", "Inflammatory Bowel Diseases", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082056890", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57207890660": {"Name": "Cheung K.S.", "AuthorID": "57207890660", "AffiliationID": "60114500", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital"}, "57200134806": {"Name": "Chen L.", "AuthorID": "57200134806", "AffiliationID": "60006541, 60033020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital"}, "56404308000": {"Name": "Seto W.K.", "AuthorID": "56404308000", "AffiliationID": "60114500", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital"}, "57188802557": {"Name": "Leung W.K.", "AuthorID": "57188802557", "AffiliationID": "60006541, 60033020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital"}, "14043219000": {"Name": "Chan E.W.", "AuthorID": "14043219000", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, The University of Hong Kong"}, "7102513915": {"Name": "Wong I.C.K.", "AuthorID": "7102513915", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}}}
