A few matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are known to support this key process, but its energetic aspects remain unknown. Here, we captured the thermodynamics of the triple helix unwinding by monitoring interactions between a collagen peptide and MMP-1(E200A) \u2013 an active-site mutant of an archetypal vertebrate collagenase \u2013 at increasing temperatures, using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Coupled binding and unwinding manifests as a curved relationship between the total enthalpy change and temperature of the reaction, producing increasingly negative heat capacity change (\u0394\u0394Cp \u2248 \u221236.3 kcal/molK2). A specially designed solid-phase binding and cleavage assay (SPBCA) reported strain in the catalytically relevant unwound state, suggesting that this state is distinct from the horizon of sampled conformations of the collagenase-susceptible site. MMP-1 appears to blend selected fit with induced fit mechanisms to catalyse collagen unwinding prior to cleavage of individual collagen chains.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Collagen unwinding", "Collagenolysis", "Coupled equilibria", "MMP", "Selected and induced fit"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85093667007", "SubjectAreas": [["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"57219834545": {"Name": "Manka S.W.", "AuthorID": "57219834545", "AffiliationID": "60007247, 60026851, 60002634", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, University of Oxford"}, "57204280691": {"Name": "Brew K.", "AuthorID": "57204280691", "AffiliationID": "60017606", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Science, Florida Atlantic University"}}}
