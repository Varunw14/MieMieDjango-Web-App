Recent theory and research concerning minority stress have focused on same-sex couples\u2019 experiences of both eventful and chronic stressors associated with being in a stigmatized relationship, including having ongoing or episodic fears of discrimination, and experiencing actual acts of discrimination. Such couple-level minority stressors represent a novel domain of social stress affecting minority populations that is only beginning to become a focus in empirical investigations testing minority stress theory. This article presents the results of psychometric analyses of dyadic data from 106 same-sex couples from across the U.S., introducing the Couple-Level Minority Stress (CLMS) scale featuring eight new couple-level minority stress factors: (1) Couple-Level Stigma; (2) Couple-Level Discrimination; (3) Seeking Safety as a Couple; (4) Perceived Unequal Relationship Recognition; (5) Couple-Level Visibility; (6) Managing Stereotypes about Same-Sex Couples; (7) Lack of Integration with Families of Origin; and (8) Lack of Social Support for Couples. The CLMS demonstrated a clear factor structure with satisfactory model-data fit and subscale reliabilities. The CLMS also exhibited validity as a correlate of one indicator of relationship quality (relationship satisfaction) and three indicators of mental health (nonspecific psychological distress, depressive symptomatology, and problematic drinking) when controlling for individual-level minority stressors and has great potential to extend and enrich minority stress research, particularly studies that deepen understandings of longstanding health inequities based on sexual orientation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Couple-level", "Couples", "Minority stress", "Sexual orientation", "Stigma"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Family Characteristics", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Minority Groups", "Sexual Behavior", "Social Stigma", "Stress, Psychological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073928738", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"6602549476": {"Name": "Neilands T.B.", "AuthorID": "6602549476", "AffiliationID": "60031970, 60014751", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, UCSF School of Medicine, Center for AIDS Prevention Studies"}, "7103232966": {"Name": "LeBlanc A.J.", "AuthorID": "7103232966", "AffiliationID": "60027627", "AffiliationName": "Health Equity Institute (HEI), San Francisco State University"}, "57211434185": {"Name": "Chang J.", "AuthorID": "57211434185", "AffiliationID": "60027627", "AffiliationName": "Health Equity Institute (HEI), San Francisco State University"}, "12807081700": {"Name": "Frost D.M.", "AuthorID": "12807081700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57201155893": {"Name": "Bowen K.", "AuthorID": "57201155893", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "University of California Hastings College of Law"}, "7402033120": {"Name": "Sullivan P.S.", "AuthorID": "7402033120", "AffiliationID": "60025315, 60000928", "AffiliationName": "Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University"}, "7006621822": {"Name": "Hoff C.C.", "AuthorID": "7006621822", "AffiliationID": "60027627", "AffiliationName": "Center for Research and Education on Gender and Sexuality, San Francisco State University"}}}
