We consider fixed effect estimation of nonlinear panel single-index models with factor structures in the unobservables, which include logit, probit, ordered probit and Poisson specifications. We establish that fixed effect estimators of model parameters and average partial effects have normal distributions when the two dimensions of the panel grow large, but might suffer from incidental parameter bias. We also show how models with factor structures can be applied to capture important features of network data such as reciprocity, degree heterogeneity, homophily in latent variables, and clustering. We illustrate this applicability with an empirical example to the estimation of a gravity equation of international trade between countries using a Poisson model with multiple factors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bias correction", "Factor models", "Gravity equation", "Incidental parameter problem", "Interactive fixed effects", "Network data", "Panel data"], "IndexKeywords": ["Factor structure", "Important features", "Interactive effect", "Model parameters", "Multiple factors", "Nonlinear factors", "Panel data models", "Single index models"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085197057", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"57194654051": {"Name": "Chen M.", "AuthorID": "57194654051", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University of Warwick"}, "9337516200": {"Name": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Val I.", "AuthorID": "9337516200", "AffiliationID": "60019674", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, Boston University"}, "55241495000": {"Name": "Weidner M.", "AuthorID": "55241495000", "AffiliationID": "60012327, 60117041", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice, Institute for Fiscal Studies"}}}
