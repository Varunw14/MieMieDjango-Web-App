However, VLC is hindered by the low penetration depth of visible light in non-transparent media. One solution is to extend operation into the \u201cnearly (in)visible\u201d near-infrared (NIR, 700\u20131000 nm) region, thus also enabling VLC in photonic bio-applications, considering the biological tissue NIR semitransparency, while conveniently retaining vestigial red emission to help check the link operativity by simple eye inspection. Here, we report new far-red/NIR organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) with a 650\u2013800 nm emission range and external quantum efficiencies among the highest reported in this spectral range (>2.7%, with maximum radiance and luminance of 3.5 mW/cm2 and 260 cd/m2, respectively). With these OLEDs, we then demonstrate a \u201creal-time\u201d VLC setup achieving a data rate of 2.2 Mb/s, which satisfies the requirements for IoT and biosensing applications. These are the highest rates ever reported for an online unequalised VLC link based on solution-processed OLEDs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biosensing applications", "External quantum efficiency", "Internet of Things (IOT)", "Optical intensity modulation", "Organic light emitting diodes(OLEDs)", "Polymer light emitting diode", "Visible light communications (VLC)", "Wireless technologies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083989817", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"55840747800": {"Name": "Minotto A.", "AuthorID": "55840747800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy and London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "7006071546": {"Name": "Cacialli F.", "AuthorID": "7006071546", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy and London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "55103012600": {"Name": "Haigh P.A.", "AuthorID": "55103012600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Communications and Information Systems, University College London"}, "7003497031": {"Name": "Darwazeh I.", "AuthorID": "7003497031", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Communications and Information Systems, University College London"}, "56644819400": {"Name": "\u0141ukasiewicz \u0141.G.", "AuthorID": "56644819400", "AffiliationID": "60014383, 60085460", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Organic Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "57206529872": {"Name": "Gryko D.T.", "AuthorID": "57206529872", "AffiliationID": "60014383, 60085460", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Organic Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "55949334800": {"Name": "Lunedei E.", "AuthorID": "55949334800", "AffiliationID": "60008737", "AffiliationName": "ISMN-CNR, Institute for the Study of Nanostructured Materials"}}}
