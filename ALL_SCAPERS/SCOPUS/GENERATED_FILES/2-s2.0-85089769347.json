Diagnosis is often difficult due to non-specific clinical features and the unavailability of laboratory tests in many low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Clinical prediction models have the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and rationalise antibiotic usage in neonatal units, which may result in reduced antimicrobial resistance and improved neonatal outcomes. In this paper, we outline our scoping review protocol to map the literature concerning clinical prediction models to diagnose neonatal sepsis. We aim to provide an overview of existing models and evidence underlying their use and compare prediction models between high-income countries and LMICs. Methods and analysis The protocol was developed with reference to recommendations by the Joanna Briggs Institute. Searches will include six electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Global Index Medicus and the Cochrane Library) supplemented by hand searching of reference lists and citation analysis on included studies. No time period restrictions will be applied but only studies published in English or Spanish will be included. Screening and data extraction will be performed independently by two reviewers, with a third reviewer used to resolve conflicts. The results will be reported by narrative synthesis in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. Ethics and dissemination The nature of the scoping review methodology means that this study does not require ethical approval. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations, as well as through engagement with peers and relevant stakeholders.", "AuthorKeywords": ["infectious diseases", "neonatal intensive & critical care", "neonatology", "paediatrics", "statistics & research methods"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089769347", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57218607849": {"Name": "Neal S.R.", "AuthorID": "57218607849", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Infection Immunity and Inflammation, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "55750371200": {"Name": "Fitzgerald F.", "AuthorID": "55750371200", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Infection Immunity and Inflammation, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57218607677": {"Name": "Musorowegomo D.", "AuthorID": "57218607677", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, University of Zimbabwe, College of Health Sciences"}, "57177977800": {"Name": "Chimhini G.", "AuthorID": "57177977800", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, University of Zimbabwe, College of Health Sciences"}, "57199091322": {"Name": "Gannon H.", "AuthorID": "57199091322", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Population Policy and Practice, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "26643625100": {"Name": "Cortina Borja M.", "AuthorID": "26643625100", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Population Policy and Practice, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "22234232400": {"Name": "Heys M.", "AuthorID": "22234232400", "AffiliationID": "60099152", "AffiliationName": "Specialist Children's and Young People's Services, East London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
