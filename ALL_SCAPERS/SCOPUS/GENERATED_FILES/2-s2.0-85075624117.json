The process of memory reconsolidation - where stored memories become briefly labile upon retrieval - may offer a means to disrupt MRMs and prevent relapse. However, reliable means for pharmacologically weakening MRMs in humans remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that the N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist ketamine is able to disrupt MRMs in hazardous drinkers when administered immediately after their retrieval. MRM retrieval + ketamine (RET + KET) effectively reduced the reinforcing effects of alcohol and long-term drinking levels, compared to ketamine or retrieval alone. Blood concentrations of ketamine and its metabolites during the critical \u2018reconsolidation window\u2019 predicted beneficial changes only following MRM reactivation. Pharmacological reconsolidation interference may provide a means to rapidly rewrite maladaptive memory and should be further pursued in alcohol and drug use disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Psychological", "Adult", "Alcohol Drinking", "Biomarkers", "Female", "Humans", "Ketamine", "Male", "Memory", "Reinforcement, Psychology", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075624117", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57214668670": {"Name": "Das R.K.", "AuthorID": "57214668670", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychopharmacology Unit, University College London"}, "56519393300": {"Name": "Gale G.", "AuthorID": "56519393300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychopharmacology Unit, University College London"}, "57203388338": {"Name": "Walsh K.", "AuthorID": "57203388338", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychopharmacology Unit, University College London"}, "57200386115": {"Name": "Hennessy V.E.", "AuthorID": "57200386115", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychopharmacology Unit, University College London"}, "7005313659": {"Name": "Curran H.V.", "AuthorID": "7005313659", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychopharmacology Unit, University College London"}, "7003707171": {"Name": "Kamboj S.K.", "AuthorID": "7003707171", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychopharmacology Unit, University College London"}, "57201999172": {"Name": "Iskandar G.", "AuthorID": "57201999172", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "University College Hospital and University College Hospital at Westmoreland Street"}, "56041230700": {"Name": "Mordecai L.A.", "AuthorID": "56041230700", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Pain Management Centre, University College Hospital"}, "6603628167": {"Name": "Brandner B.", "AuthorID": "6603628167", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Pain Management Centre, University College Hospital"}, "7003984408": {"Name": "Kindt M.", "AuthorID": "7003984408", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Clinical Psychology, University of Amsterdam"}}}
