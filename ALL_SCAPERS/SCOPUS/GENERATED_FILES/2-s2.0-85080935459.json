The technique of Liquid Cell Electron Microscopy was used to probe the crystal growth of flufenamic acid; a current commercialised active pharmaceutical ingredient. This work demonstrates liquid phase electron microscopy analysis as an essential tool for assessing pharmaceutical crystal growth in their native environment while giving insight into polymorph identification of nano-crystals at their very inception. Possible mechanisms of crystal nucleation due to the electron beam with a focus on radiolysis are discussed along with the innovations this technique offers to the study of pharmaceutical crystals and other low contrast materials.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Active pharmaceutical ingredients", "Carrier solvent", "Crystal nucleation", "Electron beam irradiation", "Flufenamic acid", "Native environment", "Organic crystal", "Possible mechanisms", "Crystallization", "Flufenamic Acid", "Microscopy, Electron, Transmission", "Nanoparticles", "Particle Size"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85080935459", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57216286708": {"Name": "Cookman J.", "AuthorID": "57216286708", "AffiliationID": "60009602", "AffiliationName": "Bernal Institute, University of Limerick Castletroy"}, "7006672175": {"Name": "Bangert U.", "AuthorID": "7006672175", "AffiliationID": "60009602", "AffiliationName": "Bernal Institute, University of Limerick Castletroy"}, "57209850927": {"Name": "Hamilton V.", "AuthorID": "57209850927", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Bristol"}, "36616258000": {"Name": "Hall S.R.", "AuthorID": "36616258000", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Bristol"}, "7201882352": {"Name": "Price L.S.", "AuthorID": "7201882352", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
