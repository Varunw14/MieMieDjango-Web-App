This work is based around the RaySAR open-source model and the outputs have been configured for both monostatic and bistatic geometries. Input CAD models of various military and civilian vehicles are used to produce the SAR imagery. This output imagery was then used to train a tiny you only look once convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier. The classification success of the CNN applied was showed to produce significantly accurate results and the whole pipeline of processing enabled rapid evaluation of potential ATR methods against targets of choice.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Civilian vehicles", "Convolutional neural network", "High-fidelity", "Open source tools", "Open-source model", "SAR imagery", "Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) simulations", "Target Classification"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075864066", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57212089390": {"Name": "Woollard M.", "AuthorID": "57212089390", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57212092224": {"Name": "Bannon A.", "AuthorID": "57212092224", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "36186273500": {"Name": "Ritchie M.", "AuthorID": "36186273500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7202821654": {"Name": "Griffiths H.", "AuthorID": "7202821654", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
