We design a power-efficient algorithm to minimize the long-term sum transmit power under delay constraints. We do this by jointly optimizing the uplink transmit power and the downlink beamforming vectors while satisfying the long-term stability constraints on the queue buffers for the downlink and uplink users as well as quality of service constraints. Due to the stochastic nature of the problem, we exploit the classic drift-plus-penalty function and subsequently simplify the problem into a difference of convex functions. Building upon the transformed problem, we propose two algorithm designs, one, that exploits the users with good channel conditions for efficient resource allocation, and the other that ensures delay-fairness among all users based on the max-min formulation. Simulation results show significant gains achieved by the proposed FD schemes compared with the baseline HD schemes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Full-duplex", "power minimization", "queue", "stability"], "IndexKeywords": ["Difference of convex functions", "Downlink beam-forming", "Efficient resource allocation", "Full-duplex", "Power minimization", "Quality of Service constraints", "queue", "Resource allocation problem"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082056097", "SubjectAreas": [["Automotive Engineering", "ENGI", "2203"], ["Aerospace Engineering", "ENGI", "2202"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"57201894804": {"Name": "Kabir M.T.", "AuthorID": "57201894804", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "23009493900": {"Name": "Masouros C.", "AuthorID": "23009493900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
