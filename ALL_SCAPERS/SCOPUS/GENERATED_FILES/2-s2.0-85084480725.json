The deposition of A\u03b2 in the brain due to impaired A\u03b2 clearance is considered as an important cause of AD. The decrease in A\u03b2 clearance is closely related to the autophagy dysfunction in brains of AD patients. It is feasible to treat AD by increasing the autophagy level of cells such as microglia and neurons to accelerate A\u03b2 clearance. In this article we explored the ability of graphene oxide (GO) to clear A\u03b2 through activating autophagy. Our work demonstrated that GO could inhibit the mTOR signaling pathway by activating AMPK to induce the autophagy of microglial and neurons. As expected, with the improvement of autophagy ability of microglia, GO promoted microglia-mediated A\u03b2 phagocytosis. Under the conditions of co-culture of microglia and neurons, GO induced the autophagy of microglia and neurons, especially the autophagy of microglia, thereby promoting the clearance of A\u03b2, and ultimately achieved the effect of protecting neurons. Moreover, GO was not only non-cytotoxic to microglia and neurons but also able to reduce the toxicity of A\u03b2 to neurons through its clearance. These results have shown the potential of GO in treating Alzheimer's disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Autophagy", "Co-culture", "Graphene oxide", "mTOR", "\u03b2-amyloid clearance"], "IndexKeywords": ["AMP-Activated Protein Kinases", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Animals", "Autophagy", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Enzyme Activation", "Graphite", "Humans", "Mice", "Microglia", "Neurons", "Phagocytosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084480725", "SubjectAreas": [["Toxicology", "PHAR", "3005"]], "AuthorData": {"57216738962": {"Name": "Li X.", "AuthorID": "57216738962", "AffiliationID": "60018038, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Medical School, State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Key Laboratory of Bioactive Materials for Ministry of Education, Nankai University"}, "57200307996": {"Name": "Li K.", "AuthorID": "57200307996", "AffiliationID": "60018038, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Medical School, State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Key Laboratory of Bioactive Materials for Ministry of Education, Nankai University"}, "57216743012": {"Name": "Chu F.", "AuthorID": "57216743012", "AffiliationID": "60018038, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Medical School, State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Key Laboratory of Bioactive Materials for Ministry of Education, Nankai University"}, "35254805300": {"Name": "Yang Z.", "AuthorID": "35254805300", "AffiliationID": "60018038, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Medical School, State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Key Laboratory of Bioactive Materials for Ministry of Education, Nankai University"}, "35242219300": {"Name": "Huang J.", "AuthorID": "35242219300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
