We use the Berry phase operator method within density functional theory to calculate how an applied electric field affects barriers for the creation of oxygen vacancy-interstitial defect pairs (DPs) and diffusion of interstitial O ions in monoclinic (m-)HfO2. The results demonstrate that even close to breakdown fields, barriers for DP generation exceed 6 eV in the perfect m-HfO2 lattice. Simulated injection of extra electrons from electrodes significantly lowers barriers for the creation of DPs, which are further reduced by the field to around 1 eV. Thus, bias application facilitates the injection of electrons into the oxide; these extra electrons reduce energy barriers for the creation of O vacancies, and these barriers as well as those for O ion diffusion are further lowered by the field. We find that, within a linear regime, the electric field modulates the barrier height by a dot product between the electric field and the electric dipole at the zero-field transition state to good accuracy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Barrier heights", "Breakdown field", "Defect generation", "Diffusion in metals", "Electronic device", "Interstitial defects", "Oxide degradation", "Transition state"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089986283", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57189627614": {"Name": "Strand J.W.", "AuthorID": "57189627614", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57189512233": {"Name": "Cottom J.", "AuthorID": "57189512233", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7007118546": {"Name": "Shluger A.L.", "AuthorID": "7007118546", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "6603668511": {"Name": "Larcher L.", "AuthorID": "6603668511", "AffiliationID": "123435530", "AffiliationName": "Applied Materials, NMS"}}}
