All rights reserved.Time-resolved near-infrared spectroscopy (TR-NIRS) measurements can be used to recover changes in concentrations of tissue constituents (\u2206C) by applying the moments method and the Beer-Lambert law. In this work we carried out the error propagation analysis allowing to calculate the standard deviations of uncertainty in estimation of the \u2206C. Here, we show the process of choosing wavelengths for the evaluation of hemodynamic (oxy-, deoxyhemoglobin) and metabolic (cytochrome-c-oxidase (CCO)) responses within the brain tissue as measured with an in-house developed TR-NIRS multi-wavelength system, which measures at 16 consecutive wavelengths separated by 12.5 nm and placed between 650 and 950 nm. Data generated with Monte Carlo simulations on three-layered model (scalp, skull, brain) for wavelengths range from 650 to 950 nm were used to carry out the error propagation analysis for varying choices of wavelengths. For a detector with a spectrally uniform responsivity, the minimal standard deviation of the estimated changes in CCO within the brain layer, \u03c3\u2206CCCO brain = 0.40 \u00b5M, was observed for the 16 consecutive wavelengths from 725 to 912.5 nm. For realistic a detector model, i.e. the spectral responsivity characteristic is considered, the minimum, \u03c3\u2206CCCO brain = 0.47 \u00b5M, was observed at the 16 consecutive wavelengths from 688 to 875 nm. We introduce the method of applying the error propagation analysis to data as measured with spectral TR-NIRS systems to calculate uncertainty of recovery of tissue constituents concentrations.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Beer Lambert law", "Cytochrome c oxidase", "Detector modeling", "Error propagation analysis", "Multi-wavelengths", "Spectral responsivity", "Standard deviation", "Time-resolved near-infrared spectroscopy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078696591", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57204613410": {"Name": "Sudakou A.", "AuthorID": "57204613410", "AffiliationID": "60028874", "AffiliationName": "Nalecz Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "23981379200": {"Name": "Wojtkiewicz S.", "AuthorID": "23981379200", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham"}, "14622432600": {"Name": "Gerega A.", "AuthorID": "14622432600", "AffiliationID": "60028874", "AffiliationName": "Nalecz Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "35725866600": {"Name": "Sawosz P.", "AuthorID": "35725866600", "AffiliationID": "60028874", "AffiliationName": "Nalecz Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "7003517162": {"Name": "Liebert A.", "AuthorID": "7003517162", "AffiliationID": "60028874", "AffiliationName": "Nalecz Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "56803353300": {"Name": "Lange F.", "AuthorID": "56803353300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "6507301690": {"Name": "Tachtsidis I.", "AuthorID": "6507301690", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
