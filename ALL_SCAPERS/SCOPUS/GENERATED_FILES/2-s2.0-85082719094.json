This essay sets out to analyse Mark Rothko\u2019s Harvard Murals exhibited in the form of an augmented reality at the Harvard Art Museums in Cambridge, MA. With the help of this and further examples, it argues that the changeable character of artworks does not comply with the traditional museum and its techniques of musealisation that privilege the idea of artworks as objects manifest in a physical matter. The traditional functionality of a museum has therefore been challenged. Accepting the changeable nature of artworks, contemporary conservation does not return artworks to their past condition but actively takes part in their actualisation on the basis of the archive. Further artworks by Yoko Ono and Nam June Paik are understood in terms of their duration, slow and fast, while the museum and conservation acquire a particular relation to time.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Actualisation", "changeability", "contingency", "continuity", "duration", "museum", "slow and fast art", "vehicular and artistic medium"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082719094", "SubjectAreas": [["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Museology", "ARTS", "1209"], ["Conservation", "ARTS", "1206"]], "AuthorData": {"57191258269": {"Name": "H\u00f6lling H.B.", "AuthorID": "57191258269", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of History of Art, University College London"}}}
