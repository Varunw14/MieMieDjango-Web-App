Epilepsia published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of International League Against Epilepsy.Objective: Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) lesion detection and subtyping remain challenging on conventional MRI. New diffusion models such as the spherical mean technique (SMT) and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) provide measurements that potentially produce more specific maps of abnormal tissue microstructure. This study aims to assess the SMT and NODDI maps for computational and radiological lesion characterization compared to standard fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). Methods: SMT, NODDI, FA, and MD maps were calculated for 33 pediatric patients with suspected FCD (18 histologically confirmed). Two neuroradiologists scored lesion visibility on clinical images and diffusion maps. Signal profile changes within lesions and homologous regions were quantified using a surface-based approach. Diffusion parameter changes at multiple cortical depths were statistically compared between FCD type IIa and type IIb. Results: Compared to fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) or T1-weighted imaging, lesions conspicuity on NODDI intracellular volume fraction (ICVF) maps was better/equal/worse in 5/14/14 patients, respectively, while on SMT intra-neurite volume fraction (INVF) in 3/3/27. Compared to FA or MD, lesion conspicuity on the ICVF was better/equal/worse in 27/4/2, while on the INVF in 20/7/6. Quantitative signal profiling demonstrated significant ICVF and INVF reductions in the lesions, whereas SMT microscopic mean, radial, and axial diffusivities were significantly increased. FCD type IIb exhibited greater changes than FCD type IIa. No changes were detected on FA or MD profiles. Significance: FCD lesion-specific signal changes were found in ICVF and INVF but not in FA and MD maps. ICVF and INVF showed greater contrast than FLAIR in some cases and had consistent signal changes specific to FCD, suggesting that they could improve current presurgical pediatric epilepsy imaging protocols and can provide features useful for automated lesion detection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cortical dysplasia", "epileptogenic zone", "multi-compartment diffusion models"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Anisotropy", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Diffusion Tensor Imaging", "Epilepsy", "Extracellular Space", "Female", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Intracellular Space", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Malformations of Cortical Development, Group I", "Neurites", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079707560", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56318479900": {"Name": "Lorio S.", "AuthorID": "56318479900", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, St Thomas\u2019 Hospital, King\u2019s College London"}, "57192888001": {"Name": "Adler S.", "AuthorID": "57192888001", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neurosciences, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "55290679000": {"Name": "Clark C.A.", "AuthorID": "55290679000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neurosciences, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "56347087500": {"Name": "Cross J.H.", "AuthorID": "56347087500", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neurosciences, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7003274699": {"Name": "Baldeweg T.", "AuthorID": "7003274699", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neurosciences, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "8588211000": {"Name": "Carmichael D.W.", "AuthorID": "8588211000", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, St Thomas\u2019 Hospital, King\u2019s College London"}, "6507532635": {"Name": "Gunny R.", "AuthorID": "6507532635", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "57196118971": {"Name": "D\u2019Arco F.", "AuthorID": "57196118971", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "21834356800": {"Name": "Kaden E.", "AuthorID": "21834356800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "56538706700": {"Name": "Wagstyl K.", "AuthorID": "56538706700", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Brain Mapping Unit, Institute of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge"}, "7003519864": {"Name": "Jacques T.S.", "AuthorID": "7003519864", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
