This is important to appreciate in order to understand their diagnostic relevance in modern medicine and subsequent interpretation of results by fellow clinicians. This article reviews the original description of these tests by their namesakes, how they have evolved over time and their relevance in orthopaedics today. An online literature review (PubMed) was conducted of the original descriptions and other published literature detailing their history, evolution, sensitivity and specificity. While elements of these tests have been lost naturally over time to the \u2018Chinese Whispers\u2019 effect, most have evolved positively secondary to a deepening anatomical and pathological understanding of their target conditions. They retain some usefulness in clinical medicine, however it is recognized that their diagnostic value is invariably supplanted by improvements in diagnostic imaging.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clinical", "eponymous", "examinations", "orthopaedic"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85097086995", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"], ["Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation", "HEAL", "3612"], ["Rehabilitation", "MEDI", "2742"]], "AuthorData": {"57208688513": {"Name": "Humphries E.L.", "AuthorID": "57208688513", "AffiliationID": "60031564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics and Trauma, Royal Adelaide Hospital"}, "57220160171": {"Name": "Allen F.", "AuthorID": "57220160171", "AffiliationID": "60026392, 60001417", "AffiliationName": "Dartford and Gravesham NHS Trust, Darent Valley Hospital"}, "55056446300": {"Name": "Grange S.", "AuthorID": "55056446300", "AffiliationID": "60070817", "AffiliationName": "Zayed Military Hospital"}, "33067771800": {"Name": "Goldberg A.", "AuthorID": "33067771800", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "19640673800": {"Name": "Smitham P.", "AuthorID": "19640673800", "AffiliationID": "60031564", "AffiliationName": "Royal Adelaide Hospital"}}}
