Methods: Surveys from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study (JAGES) and the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA) included 70,751 and 4134 participants, respectively, aged 65 years or older in 2010 and 94,228 and 4295 participants in 2016. We assessed the social isolation of respondents on a scale from 0 to 5 points based on lack of social interactions with a spouse or partner, children, relatives, or friends and nonparticipation in any organization. Results: Results of two-way analysis of variance confirmed significant interactions (nation \u00d7 period) in men and women aged 65\u201374 years and women aged 75 years or older. In JAGES, all had higher scores in 2016 compared to 2010 (1.64\u20131.76, 1.28\u20131.36, and 1.55\u20131.60 points, respectively). Furthermore, the proportions of those with lack of interaction with relatives increased (52.7%\u201358.9%, 31.5%\u201341.1%, and 25.2%39.2%, respectively). In ELSA, women aged 75 years or older demonstrated a significantly lower mean score in 2016 than in 2010 (1.40 vs. 1.21). No significant changes were observed in other groups. Conclusion: Social isolation among older adults is more severe in Japan than in England. The difference has widened, especially for women and younger older adults. This is attributed to the weakening relationships with relatives in Japan.", "AuthorKeywords": ["National comparison", "Social interaction", "Social participation", "Solitary death"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089835007", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Gerontology", "NURS", "2909"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"36237178700": {"Name": "Tsuji T.", "AuthorID": "36237178700", "AffiliationID": "60002787", "AffiliationName": "Center for Preventive Medical Sciences, Chiba University"}, "16834880600": {"Name": "Kondo K.", "AuthorID": "16834880600", "AffiliationID": "60025760", "AffiliationName": "Center for Gerontology and Social Science, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology"}, "37001221100": {"Name": "Saito M.", "AuthorID": "37001221100", "AffiliationID": "60023165", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Welfare, Nihon Fukushi University"}, "57205493460": {"Name": "Ikeda T.", "AuthorID": "57205493460", "AffiliationID": "60008435", "AffiliationName": "Department of International and Community Oral Health, Tohoku University Graduate School of Dentistry"}, "36852116300": {"Name": "Osaka K.", "AuthorID": "36852116300", "AffiliationID": "60008435", "AffiliationName": "Department of International and Community Oral Health, Tohoku University Graduate School of Dentistry"}, "22984268200": {"Name": "Aida J.", "AuthorID": "22984268200", "AffiliationID": "60008435", "AffiliationName": "Liaison Center for Innovative Dentistry, Tohoku University Graduate School of Dentistry"}, "22633502300": {"Name": "Cable N.", "AuthorID": "22633502300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "56440893000": {"Name": "Koyama S.", "AuthorID": "56440893000", "AffiliationID": "60138477", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Control Center, Osaka International Cancer Institute"}, "57207112486": {"Name": "Noguchi T.", "AuthorID": "57207112486", "AffiliationID": "60025760", "AffiliationName": "Center for Gerontology and Social Science, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology"}}}
