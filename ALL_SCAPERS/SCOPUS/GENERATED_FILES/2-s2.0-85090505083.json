Little information is available from Southern African countries which have similar climatic and occupational characteristics to CKDu-endemic countries. We investigated whether CKDu is prevalent in Malawi and identified its potential risk factors in this setting. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study from January-August 2018 collecting bio samples and anthropometric data in two Malawian populations. The sample comprised adults > 18 years (n = 821) without diabetes, hypertension, and proteinuria. Estimates of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were calculated using the CKD-EPI equation. Linear and logistic regression models were applied with potential risk factors, to estimate risk of reduced eGFR. Results: The mean eGFR was 117.1 \u00b1 16.0 ml/min per 1.73m2 and the mean participant age was 33.5 \u00b1 12.7 years. The prevalence of eGFR< 60 was 0.2% (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.1, 0.9); the prevalence of eGFR< 90 was 5% (95% CI =3.2, 6.3). We observed a higher prevalence in the rural population (5% (3.6, 7.8)), versus urban (3% (1.4, 6.7)). Age and BMI were associated with reduced eGFR< 90 [Odds ratio (OR) (95%CI) =3.59 (2.58, 5.21) per ten-year increment]; [OR (95%CI) =2.01 (1.27, 3.43) per 5 kg/m2 increment] respectively. No increased risk of eGFR < 90 was observed for rural participants [OR (95%CI) =1.75 (0.50, 6.30)]. Conclusions: Reduced kidney function consistent with the definition of CKDu is not common in the areas of Malawi sampled, compared to that observed in other tropical or sub-tropical countries in Central America and South Asia. Reduced eGFR< 90 was related to age, BMI, and was more common in rural areas. These findings are important as they contradict some current hypothesis that CKDu is endemic across tropical and sub-tropical countries. This study has enabled standardized comparisons of impaired kidney function between and within tropical/subtropical regions of the world and will help form the basis for further etiological research, surveillance strategies, and the implementation and evaluation of interventions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chronic kidney disease", "Epidemiology", "Estimated glomerular filtration rate", "Prevalence", "Risk factor", "Sub-Saharan Africa"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090505083", "SubjectAreas": [["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"57211084810": {"Name": "Hamilton S.A.", "AuthorID": "57211084810", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London, School of Public Health"}, "16205094600": {"Name": "Fecht D.", "AuthorID": "16205094600", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60175886", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Environment and Health, Imperial College London"}, "7103293037": {"Name": "Vineis P.", "AuthorID": "7103293037", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60175886", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Environment and Health, Imperial College London"}, "56938998700": {"Name": "Nakanga W.P.", "AuthorID": "56938998700", "AffiliationID": "60072682", "AffiliationName": "Malawi Epidemiology and Intervention Research Unit"}, "57191781458": {"Name": "Prynn J.E.", "AuthorID": "57191781458", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "57215020825": {"Name": "Crampin A.C.", "AuthorID": "57215020825", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "6603237610": {"Name": "Nyirenda M.J.", "AuthorID": "6603237610", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "9041571200": {"Name": "Caplin B.", "AuthorID": "9041571200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nephrology, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "57212596095": {"Name": "Pearce N.", "AuthorID": "57212596095", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Global NCDs, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}}}
