The present data set covers a period of one year (from 2013-01-01 to 2013-12-31). The collected data pertains to indoor environmental conditions (temperature, humidity) as well as plug loads and external factors (temperature, humidity, wind speed, and global irradiance) along with occupants\u2019 presence and operation of windows and lights. The monitored data can be used for multiple purposes, including the development and validation of occupancy-related models.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Behavior", "Built Environment", "Humans", "Humidity", "Lighting", "Sunlight", "Temperature", "Wind"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075699058", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"], ["Library and Information Sciences", "SOCI", "3309"]], "AuthorData": {"7006750113": {"Name": "Mahdavi A.", "AuthorID": "7006750113", "AffiliationID": "60018163", "AffiliationName": "Department of Building Physics and Building Ecology, TU Wien"}, "57210910056": {"Name": "Berger C.", "AuthorID": "57210910056", "AffiliationID": "60018163", "AffiliationName": "Department of Building Physics and Building Ecology, TU Wien"}, "55295917500": {"Name": "Schuss M.", "AuthorID": "55295917500", "AffiliationID": "60018163", "AffiliationName": "Department of Building Physics and Building Ecology, TU Wien"}, "56367480500": {"Name": "Tahmasebi F.", "AuthorID": "56367480500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering, University College London"}}}
