However, FFR does not allow assessment of plaque morphology and lesion geometry. Intracoronary imaging techniques such as intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) can help treatment planning by optimising stent implantation, which can improve patient outcomes. The aim of this meta-analysis is to compare the efficacy of IVUS and OCT-derived metrics in detecting flow limiting stenoses in non-left main stem lesions. Methods: A systematic review of PubMed, Medline, and Cochrane databases was performed and identified studies examining the diagnostic accuracy of IVUS and OCT in detecting significant stenoses when compared to FFR. Results: A total of 33 (7537 lesions) studies (24 IVUS, 7 OCT and 2 IVUS & OCT studies) were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled analysis showed that IVUS- and OCT-derived minimum lumen area (MLA) had a similar sensitivity in predicting haemodynamically significant lesions (IVUS-MLA: 0.747 vs OCT-MLA 0.732, p = 0.519). However, OCT-MLA had a higher specificity (0.763 vs 0.665, p < 0.001) and diagnostic accuracy in detecting flow-limiting stenoses than IVUS-MLA (AUC 0.810 vs 0.754, p = 0.045). Sub-analysis of the studies with the clinically significant FFR cut-off value of 0.80 yielded similar results demonstrating that OCT-MLA has a better accuracy than IVUS-MLA in detecting haemodynamically significant stenoses (AUC 0.809 vs 0.750, p = 0.034). Conclusions: OCT with its superior image resolution appears to be the preferable intravascular imaging modality for the detection of haemodynamically significant stenoses in non-left main stem lesions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fractional flow reserve", "Intravascular ultrasound", "Optical coherence tomography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Comparative Effectiveness Research", "Coronary Stenosis", "Coronary Vessels", "Humans", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Ultrasonography, Interventional"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074325231", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57190865844": {"Name": "Ramasamy A.", "AuthorID": "57190865844", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University London"}, "55568508950": {"Name": "Jones D.A.", "AuthorID": "55568508950", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University London"}, "27867977800": {"Name": "Rathod K.", "AuthorID": "27867977800", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University London"}, "7801601121": {"Name": "Amersey R.", "AuthorID": "7801601121", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "7006465445": {"Name": "Westwood M.", "AuthorID": "7006465445", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "6507229201": {"Name": "Ozkor M.", "AuthorID": "6507229201", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "26644292900": {"Name": "O'Mahony C.", "AuthorID": "26644292900", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "35380985800": {"Name": "Lansky A.", "AuthorID": "35380985800", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale School of Medicine"}, "7003845955": {"Name": "Crake T.", "AuthorID": "7003845955", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "7201657327": {"Name": "Mathur A.", "AuthorID": "7201657327", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University London"}, "56962775900": {"Name": "Baumbach A.", "AuthorID": "56962775900", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University London"}, "15822122100": {"Name": "Bourantas C.V.", "AuthorID": "15822122100", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University London"}, "57218382830": {"Name": "Chen Y.", "AuthorID": "57218382830", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}, "55224035200": {"Name": "Zanchin T.", "AuthorID": "55224035200", "AffiliationID": "60010987", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Bern University Hospital"}, "55312555100": {"Name": "Jin C.", "AuthorID": "55312555100", "AffiliationID": "60118427", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital"}, "15051093400": {"Name": "Onuma Y.", "AuthorID": "15051093400", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Thoraxcenter, Erasmus University Medical Centre"}, "55260071800": {"Name": "Zhang Y.J.", "AuthorID": "55260071800", "AffiliationID": "119180781", "AffiliationName": "XuZhou Third People's Hospital"}, "34573036500": {"Name": "Serruys P.W.", "AuthorID": "34573036500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Circulatory Health, NHLI, Imperial College London"}}}
