We examined how nutritional factors are associated with self-reported falls in the oldest-old community-dwelling men. Methods: Participants of the longitudinal and socioeconomically homogenous Helsinki Businessmen Study are men born in 1919\u20131934. A cross-sectional analysis from a random sample of 122 home-living oldest-old men who underwent medical examinations in 2017\u20132018 is reported here. Food and nutrient intakes were retrieved from 3-day food diaries, and the number of falls during past year was requested in the screening questionnaire. Nutritional status was assessed using Mini Nutritional Assessment Short Form (MNA-SF) and waist circumference was measured. Body composition was assessed with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-scans, physical performance with short physical performance battery (SPPB), sarcopenia status using European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People's 2 (EWGSOP2) criteria, and frailty with phenotypic criteria. Results: Mean age of participants was 87 years (range 83\u201399 years) and 30% reported at least one fall during past year. Falls were associated with higher waist circumference (p = .031), frailty (p < .001) and sarcopenia (p = .002), and inversely associated with SPPB total score (p = .002). Of nutritional factors, intakes of fish (p = .016), fish protein (p = .039), berry (p = .027) and vitamin D (p = .041), and snacking more protein between breakfast and lunch (p = .017) were inversely associated with falls. Red meat intake was associated with higher frequency of falls (p = .044). Conclusion: Higher waist circumference, but not body mass index, was associated with increased frequency of falls. Healthy dietary choices appeared protective from falls in these oldest-old men of similar socioeconomic status.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Berry intake", "Falls", "Fish intake", "Snacking", "Vitamin D", "Waist circumference"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092639029", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"15078004700": {"Name": "Jyv\u00e4korpi S.K.", "AuthorID": "15078004700", "AffiliationID": "60002952, 60016987", "AffiliationName": "University of Helsinki, Clinicum, and Helsinki University Hospital"}, "57200531800": {"Name": "Urtamo A.", "AuthorID": "57200531800", "AffiliationID": "60002952, 60016987", "AffiliationName": "University of Helsinki, Clinicum, and Helsinki University Hospital"}, "57218590862": {"Name": "Kivim\u00e4ki M.", "AuthorID": "57218590862", "AffiliationID": "60002952, 60016987", "AffiliationName": "University of Helsinki, Clinicum, and Helsinki University Hospital"}, "57202566229": {"Name": "Strandberg T.E.", "AuthorID": "57202566229", "AffiliationID": "60012954", "AffiliationName": "University of Oulu, Center for Life Course Health Research"}}}
