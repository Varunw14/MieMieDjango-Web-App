This is designed in order that robot is difficult to steal. The previous model is equipped with a security system. However, the system is not equipped with a camera so that when theft occurs, the action cannot be recorded. This study used 16 rules, because of the addition of variable pixels produced by the camera. The simulation is carried out as many as 30 (thirty) possible conditions of actions taken by the people on the robot with Matlab Fuzzy Toolbox. In the result of the simulations, the test results can change from safe conditions to alert or dangerous conditions. This is caused by changes in the number of pixels. The pixel value increases when someone tries to take a robot from the robot bunker. Thus the proposed model is more sensitive in detecting changes that occur around the robot bunker. Therefore this model can be applied in securing/protecting robot from theft.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Fuzzy toolbox", "Pixel values"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077818749", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57213518213": {"Name": "Naf'An E.", "AuthorID": "57213518213", "AffiliationID": "60108354", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Putra Indonesia YPTK"}, "6602275590": {"Name": "Sulaiman R.", "AuthorID": "6602275590", "AffiliationID": "60001821", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Visual Informatics, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia"}, "57213520709": {"Name": "Mohamad Ali N.", "AuthorID": "57213520709", "AffiliationID": "60001821", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Visual Informatics, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia"}, "57213521384": {"Name": "Hazidar A.", "AuthorID": "57213521384", "AffiliationID": "60001821", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Visual Informatics, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia"}, "57213518542": {"Name": "Kudr Nseaf A.", "AuthorID": "57213518542", "AffiliationID": "60001821", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Visual Informatics, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia"}, "57213520581": {"Name": "Theozard Fikri H.", "AuthorID": "57213520581", "AffiliationID": "60108354", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Putra Indonesia YPTK"}, "57197837413": {"Name": "Priambodo B.", "AuthorID": "57197837413", "AffiliationID": "60108869", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Mercu Buana"}, "57204938025": {"Name": "Handriani I.", "AuthorID": "57204938025", "AffiliationID": "60108869", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Mercu Buana"}, "57213518672": {"Name": "Pratama Putra Z.", "AuthorID": "57213518672", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
