Pre-service teacher training plays a critical role in this aim, by identifying, recruiting, retaining and training those who demonstrate potential to become teachers in English primary schools. As one of a few studies to explore the racialised and gendered experiences of black male teachers in England, I adopt the use of critical race theory (CRT) to examine how black male teachers are characterised and constructed in white education spaces. Drawing on a larger study, this paper utilises counternarrative, a key precept of CRT, to draw attention to processes of exclusion, othering and surveillance through the experience of David (the main character). Interview and documentary data illuminate institutional processes of overt and covert racism, as well as racialised and gendered stereotyping. David\u2019s story reveals how his voice is muted as it is woven into processes of othering, hyper-surveillance and disciplinary power.", "AuthorKeywords": ["black male teachers", "counter-storytelling", "critical race theory", "othering", "racism", "surveillance"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85080924459", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"56930185300": {"Name": "Callender C.", "AuthorID": "56930185300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL"}}}
