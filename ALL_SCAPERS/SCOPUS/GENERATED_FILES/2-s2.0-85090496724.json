In this article, I outline Kant's argument for why we ought to have faith in God and hope for the highest good, and argue that the Kantian argument can be extended in such a way as to show the unity of the theological virtues. This feature of the Kantian account can then have ramifications in further questions regarding the relationship of faith and moral action.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090496724", "SubjectAreas": [["Religious Studies", "ARTS", "1212"], ["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"]], "AuthorData": {"57218862686": {"Name": "Phillips R.L.", "AuthorID": "57218862686", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Philosophy, University College London"}}}
