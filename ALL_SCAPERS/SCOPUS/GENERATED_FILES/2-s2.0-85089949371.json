The database of the study comprises a total of 831 instances of signs in the form of photographs that were collected in Chinatown. The study finds that English dominates the LL while Mandarin Chinese is ranked as the second frequently used language. The study also identifies significant differences in LL features between topdown and bottom-up signs. Specifically, these differences include what languages are used; monolingual, bilingual and multilingual compositions; code preference; and forms of Chinese scripts. The present study suggests that English now dominates the linguistic landscape of Chinatown. Even though many scholars have described the sociolinguistic situation in Singapore as being 'English-knowing', the data shows a shift towards being 'English-dominant', suggesting a gradual but sustained dilution of its multilingual ethos. The study also complicates our understanding of the dominance of English in multilingual societies such as Singapore, where a competing dominant language (Mandarin Chinese) may be seen to continue to exert considerable influence on the dynamics of Englishdominant language use but, at the same time, whose main function is shifting towards the symbolic rather than communicative.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chinatown", "English", "Linguistic landscape", "Mandarin Chinese", "Quantitative analysis", "Singapore"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089949371", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"], ["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"57218660961": {"Name": "Zhang H.", "AuthorID": "57218660961", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}, "57218657585": {"Name": "Norhaida A.", "AuthorID": "57218657585", "AffiliationID": "60010940, 60005510", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University"}, "57212581575": {"Name": "Tupas R.", "AuthorID": "57212581575", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
