Here, we test this dimensionality reduction hypothesis by relating a data-driven approach to characterizing the complexity of neural representation with a theoretically-supported computational model of learning. We find evidence of goal-directed dimensionality reduction within human ventromedial PFC during learning. Importantly, by using computational predictions of each participant\u2019s attentional strategies during learning, we find that that the degree of neural compression predicts an individual\u2019s ability to selectively attend to concept-specific information. These findings suggest a domain-general mechanism of learning through compression in ventromedial PFC.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Female", "Goals", "Humans", "Learning", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077501991", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"24765016500": {"Name": "Mack M.L.", "AuthorID": "24765016500", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Toronto"}, "7102344440": {"Name": "Preston A.R.", "AuthorID": "7102344440", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, The University of Texas at Austin"}, "7102112661": {"Name": "Love B.C.", "AuthorID": "7102112661", "AffiliationID": "60111768", "AffiliationName": "Alan Turing Institute"}}}
