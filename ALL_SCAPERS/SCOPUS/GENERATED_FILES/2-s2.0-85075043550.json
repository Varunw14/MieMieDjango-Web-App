To resolve this problem, we need to supplement the ad hoc data currently collected with planned biodiversity monitoring, in order to approximate global stratified random sampling of the planet. We call this all-encompassing observational system \u2018the macroscope\u2019. The solution: With a focus on the marine realm, we identify seven main biosphere observation tools that compose the macroscope: satellites, drones, camera traps, passive acoustic samplers, biologgers, environmental DNA and human observations. By deploying a nested array of these tools that fills current gaps in monitoring, we can achieve a macroscope fit for purpose and turn these existing powerful tools into more than the sum of their parts. An appeal: Building a macroscope requires commitment from many fields, together with coordinated actions to attract the level of funding required for such a venture. We call on macroecologists to become advocates for the macroscope and to engage with existing global observation networks.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biodiversity", "monitoring", "sampling design"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075043550", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"]], "AuthorData": {"12767296600": {"Name": "Dornelas M.", "AuthorID": "12767296600", "AffiliationID": "60022132", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biological Diversity, Scottish Oceans Institute, University of St Andrews"}, "7005078185": {"Name": "Magurran A.E.", "AuthorID": "7005078185", "AffiliationID": "60022132", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biological Diversity, Scottish Oceans Institute, University of St Andrews"}, "8921762700": {"Name": "Madin E.M.P.", "AuthorID": "8921762700", "AffiliationID": "60021013, 60013791", "AffiliationName": "Hawai\u2019i Institute of Marine Biology, University of Hawai\u2019i at M\u0101noa"}, "9737836900": {"Name": "Madin J.S.", "AuthorID": "9737836900", "AffiliationID": "60021013, 60013791", "AffiliationName": "Hawai\u2019i Institute of Marine Biology, University of Hawai\u2019i at M\u0101noa"}, "55160482300": {"Name": "Bunce M.", "AuthorID": "55160482300", "AffiliationID": "115544553", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Protection Authority"}, "23388559600": {"Name": "DiBattista J.D.", "AuthorID": "23388559600", "AffiliationID": "60017681", "AffiliationName": "Australian Museum Research Institute, Australian Museum"}, "55723924800": {"Name": "Johnson M.", "AuthorID": "55723924800", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Zoophysiology, Department of Bioscience, Aarhus University"}, "6603919643": {"Name": "McGill B.J.", "AuthorID": "6603919643", "AffiliationID": "60008279", "AffiliationName": "School of Biology and Ecology and Mitchell Center for Sustainability Solutions, University of Maine"}, "8536629700": {"Name": "Pettorelli N.", "AuthorID": "8536629700", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "7404834309": {"Name": "Williams S.B.", "AuthorID": "7404834309", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Australian Centre for Field Robotics, University of Sydney"}, "16239857700": {"Name": "Pizarro O.", "AuthorID": "16239857700", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Australian Centre for Field Robotics, University of Sydney"}, "35228202800": {"Name": "Winter M.", "AuthorID": "35228202800", "AffiliationID": "60077281", "AffiliationName": "German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv)"}, "12141377200": {"Name": "Bates A.E.", "AuthorID": "12141377200", "AffiliationID": "60019000", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ocean Sciences, Memorial University"}}}
