Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The goal of this study was to translate the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire \u2013 Specific (BMQ-Specific) for cholesterol-lowering drugs, into the Hungarian, Slovak, Czech and Polish languages and test their reliability with statistical methods. For this purpose, Cronbach\u2019s alpha, confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses were conducted. The analyses included 235 Czech, 205 Hungarian, 200 Polish, and 200 Slovak respondents, all of whom were taking cholesterol-lowering drugs. The translations from English into the target languages were always done by two independent translators. As part of the validation process these translations were pilot tested and after the necessary alterations, they were translated back into English by a third translator. After the approval by the creator of the questionnaire, nationwide surveys were conducted in all four countries. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis were exceptionally good for the Czech and Slovak translations, while the Polish and Hungarian translations marginally crossed the predetermined thresholds. With the exception of a single Polish question, the results of the exploratory factor analysis were deemed acceptable. The translated versions of BMQ-Specific are reliable and valid tools to assess patients\u2019 beliefs about medication, especially medication adherence among patients taking cholesterol-lowering medication. A comparison between the four countries with this questionnaire is now possible.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardiology", "Epidemiology", "Preventive medicine", "Vascular medicine"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Attitude to Health", "Cholesterol", "Cross-Cultural Comparison", "Culture", "Female", "Humans", "Hypolipidemic Agents", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Poland", "Psychometrics", "Reproducibility of Results", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Translations", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092894572", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis", "ENVI", "2307"]], "AuthorData": {"55325546400": {"Name": "Boruzs K.", "AuthorID": "55325546400", "AffiliationID": "60108581", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Systems Management and Quality Management for Health Care, Faculty of Public Health, University of Debrecen"}, "57194217048": {"Name": "Dombr\u00e1di V.", "AuthorID": "57194217048", "AffiliationID": "60108581", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Systems Management and Quality Management for Health Care, Faculty of Public Health, University of Debrecen"}, "57218414264": {"Name": "B\u00e1nyai G.", "AuthorID": "57218414264", "AffiliationID": "60108581", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Systems Management and Quality Management for Health Care, Faculty of Public Health, University of Debrecen"}, "52363218300": {"Name": "B\u00edr\u00f3 K.", "AuthorID": "52363218300", "AffiliationID": "60108581", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Systems Management and Quality Management for Health Care, Faculty of Public Health, University of Debrecen"}, "24329905000": {"Name": "S\u00e1ndor J.", "AuthorID": "24329905000", "AffiliationID": "60108571", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health and Epidemiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen"}, "23012144600": {"Name": "Horne R.", "AuthorID": "23012144600", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Behavioural Medicine, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57192935075": {"Name": "Nagy A.", "AuthorID": "57192935075", "AffiliationID": "60108581", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Public Health, University of Debrecen"}}}
