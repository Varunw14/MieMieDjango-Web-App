Health Economics published by John Wiley & Sons LtdMissing data are a common issue in cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) alongside randomised trials and are often addressed assuming the data are \u2018missing at random\u2019. However, this assumption is often questionable, and sensitivity analyses are required to assess the implications of departures from missing at random. Reference-based multiple imputation provides an attractive approach for conducting such sensitivity analyses, because missing data assumptions are framed in an intuitive way by making reference to other trial arms. For example, a plausible not at random mechanism in a placebo-controlled trial would be to assume that participants in the experimental arm who dropped out stop taking their treatment and have similar outcomes to those in the placebo arm. Drawing on the increasing use of this approach in other areas, this paper aims to extend and illustrate the reference-based multiple imputation approach in CEA. It introduces the principles of reference-based imputation and proposes an extension to the CEA context. The method is illustrated in the CEA of the CoBalT trial evaluating cognitive behavioural therapy for treatment-resistant depression. Stata code is provided. We find that reference-based multiple imputation provides a relevant and accessible framework for assessing the robustness of CEA conclusions to different missing data assumptions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["controlled imputation", "cost-effectiveness analysis", "missing data", "missing not at random", "multiple imputation", "randomised trial", "reference-based", "sensitivity analysis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076791769", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"]], "AuthorData": {"36834163900": {"Name": "Leurent B.", "AuthorID": "36834163900", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Statistics, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7402041012": {"Name": "Carpenter J.R.", "AuthorID": "7402041012", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "19835038000": {"Name": "Gomes M.", "AuthorID": "19835038000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "55337832800": {"Name": "Cro S.", "AuthorID": "55337832800", "AffiliationID": "60020413, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial Clinical Trials Unit, School of Public Health, Imperial College London"}, "6602536089": {"Name": "Wiles N.", "AuthorID": "6602536089", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}}}
