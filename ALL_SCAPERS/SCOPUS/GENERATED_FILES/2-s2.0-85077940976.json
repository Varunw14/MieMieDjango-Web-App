A simple, yet highly effective strategy of obtaining high-order dipoles with small, computationally less expensive basis sets is described. Using the finite field method for computing dipoles, energies calculated with small basis sets can be extrapolated to produce dipoles that are comparable to those obtained in high order calculations. The method reduces computational resources by approximately 50% (allowing the calculation of reliable dipole moments for larger molecules) and simultaneously improves the agreement with experimentally measured infrared transition intensities. For atmospherically important molecules, which are typically too large to consider the use of large basis sets, this procedure will provide the necessary means of improving calculated spectral intensities by several percent.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Complete basis set limit", "Computational resources", "Finite field methods", "High-order", "Highly accurate", "Infrared transition", "Light molecules", "Spectral intensity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077940976", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57203638185": {"Name": "Conway E.K.", "AuthorID": "57203638185", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7201551593": {"Name": "Gordon I.E.", "AuthorID": "7201551593", "AffiliationID": "60020680", "AffiliationName": "Harvard and Smithsonian | Center for Astrophysics, Atomic and Molecular Physics Division"}, "7006554518": {"Name": "Polyansky O.L.", "AuthorID": "7006554518", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7101645601": {"Name": "Tennyson J.", "AuthorID": "7101645601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
