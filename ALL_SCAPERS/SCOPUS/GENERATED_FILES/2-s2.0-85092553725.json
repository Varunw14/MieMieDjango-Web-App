All rights reserved.Carboxylesterase Notum is a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway. There is an emerging understanding of the role Notum plays in disease, supporting the need to discover new small-molecule inhibitors. A crystallographic X-ray fragment screen was performed, which identified fragment hit 1,2,3-Triazole 7 as an attractive starting point for a structure-based drug design hit-To-lead program. Optimization of 7 identified oxadiazol-2-one 23dd as a preferred example with properties consistent with drug-like chemical space. Screening 23dd in a cell-based TCF/LEF reporter gene assay restored the activation of Wnt signaling in the presence of Notum. Mouse pharmacokinetic studies with oral administration of 23dd demonstrated good plasma exposure and partial blood-brain barrier penetration. Significant progress was made in developing fragment hit 7 into lead 23dd (>600-fold increase in activity), making it suitable as a new chemical tool for exploring the role of Notum-mediated regulation of Wnt signaling.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Oral", "Animals", "Binding Sites", "Blood-Brain Barrier", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "Drug Design", "Enzyme Inhibitors", "Esterases", "Half-Life", "Humans", "Inhibitory Concentration 50", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Microsomes, Liver", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Oxadiazoles", "Structure-Activity Relationship", "Wnt Signaling Pathway"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092553725", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"57218943022": {"Name": "Mahy W.", "AuthorID": "57218943022", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer's Research Uk Ucl Drug Discovery Institute, University College London"}, "55315587200": {"Name": "Willis N.J.", "AuthorID": "55315587200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer's Research Uk Ucl Drug Discovery Institute, University College London"}, "18134644900": {"Name": "Woodward H.L.", "AuthorID": "18134644900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer's Research Uk Ucl Drug Discovery Institute, University College London"}, "6603427180": {"Name": "Svensson F.", "AuthorID": "6603427180", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Francis Crick Institute"}, "57194386685": {"Name": "Sipthorp J.", "AuthorID": "57194386685", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Francis Crick Institute"}, "57210447848": {"Name": "Frew S.", "AuthorID": "57210447848", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer's Research Uk Ucl Drug Discovery Institute, University College London"}, "55751351200": {"Name": "Monaghan A.", "AuthorID": "55751351200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer's Research Uk Ucl Drug Discovery Institute, University College London"}, "24279662700": {"Name": "Bictash M.", "AuthorID": "24279662700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer's Research Uk Ucl Drug Discovery Institute, University College London"}, "7202412883": {"Name": "Whiting P.", "AuthorID": "7202412883", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer's Research Uk Ucl Drug Discovery Institute, University College London"}, "7005747441": {"Name": "Fish P.V.", "AuthorID": "7005747441", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Francis Crick Institute"}, "55362411800": {"Name": "Zhao Y.", "AuthorID": "55362411800", "AffiliationID": "60099539, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Division of Structural Biology, Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Henry Wellcome Building for Genomic Medicine"}, "54396239500": {"Name": "Vecchia L.", "AuthorID": "54396239500", "AffiliationID": "60099539, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Division of Structural Biology, Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Henry Wellcome Building for Genomic Medicine"}, "57193205370": {"Name": "Ruza R.R.", "AuthorID": "57193205370", "AffiliationID": "60099539, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Division of Structural Biology, Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Henry Wellcome Building for Genomic Medicine"}, "57214329662": {"Name": "Hillier J.", "AuthorID": "57214329662", "AffiliationID": "60099539, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Division of Structural Biology, Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Henry Wellcome Building for Genomic Medicine"}, "7404236867": {"Name": "Jones E.Y.", "AuthorID": "7404236867", "AffiliationID": "60099539, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Division of Structural Biology, Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Henry Wellcome Building for Genomic Medicine"}, "24335111400": {"Name": "Kj\u00e6r S.", "AuthorID": "24335111400", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Francis Crick Institute"}, "7403123382": {"Name": "Vincent J.P.", "AuthorID": "7403123382", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Francis Crick Institute"}, "7005468805": {"Name": "Salinas P.C.", "AuthorID": "7005468805", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Laboratory for Molecular and Cellular Biology, University College London"}}}
