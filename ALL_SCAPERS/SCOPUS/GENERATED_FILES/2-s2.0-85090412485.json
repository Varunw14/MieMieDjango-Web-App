Such formulations are traditionally complex to manufacture, requiring multiple steps. In this work, fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing was explored to prepare on-demand printlets (3D printed tablets). The design includes a prolonged release core surrounded by an insoluble shell able to provide zero-order release profiles. The effect of drug loading (10, 25, and 40% w/w paracetamol) on the mechanical and physical properties of the hot melt extruded filaments and 3D printed formulations was evaluated. Two different shell 3D designs (6 mm and 8 mm diameter apertures) together with three different core infills (100, 50, and 25%) were prepared. The formulations showed a range of zero-order release profiles spanning 16 to 48 h. The work has shown that with simple formulation design modifications, it is possible to print extended release formulations with tunable, zero-order release kinetics. Moreover, by using different infill percentages, the dose contained in the printlet can be infinitely adjusted, providing an additive manufacturing route for personalizing medicines to a patient.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D printed drug products", "Computer aided drug design and delivery", "Controlled release", "Digital pharmaceutics", "Gastrointestinal modified release drug delivery", "Health and pharmaceutical sciences", "Personalized medicines", "Printing pharmaceuticals", "Three dimensional printing"], "IndexKeywords": ["3-D printing", "Constant rate", "Extended release", "Formulation design", "Fused deposition modeling (FDM)", "Mechanical and physical properties", "Prolonged release", "Zero-order release"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090412485", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Polymers and Plastics", "MATE", "2507"]], "AuthorData": {"57194387421": {"Name": "Fina F.", "AuthorID": "57194387421", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "37037477300": {"Name": "Goyanes A.", "AuthorID": "37037477300", "AffiliationID": "60028419", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Farmacolog\u00eda, Farmacia y Tecnolog\u00eda Farmac\u00e9utica, I+D Farma (GI-1645), Facultad de Farmacia, Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS), Universidade de Santiago de Compostela"}, "6602683597": {"Name": "Gaisford S.", "AuthorID": "6602683597", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7003826707": {"Name": "Basit A.W.", "AuthorID": "7003826707", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57188984515": {"Name": "Rowland M.", "AuthorID": "57188984515", "AffiliationID": "60099418", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer Ltd., Drug Product Design"}}}
