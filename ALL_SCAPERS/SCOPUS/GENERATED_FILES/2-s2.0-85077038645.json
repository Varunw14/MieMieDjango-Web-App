This guideline collates current published data and provides advice on appropriate choice of assays for laboratory measurement of replacement therapy for patients with Haemophilia A and B without inhibitors. It is recommended that each haemophilia centre should ensure that appropriate laboratory assays are available for FVIII and FIX products in local clinical use. Patient samples should be assayed against calibrators traceable to WHO Plasma International Standards. Assay discrepancies are common especially for the extended half-life FVIII and FIX products, and assays of these products may need to be verified with the specific CFC being used.", "AuthorKeywords": ["chromogenic assay", "extended half-life", "factor concentrate", "haemophilia", "laboratory monitoring"], "IndexKeywords": ["Blood Coagulation Factors", "Clinical Laboratory Techniques", "Factor IX", "Factor VIII", "Hemophilia A", "Humans", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077038645", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"7202039475": {"Name": "Gray E.", "AuthorID": "7202039475", "AffiliationID": "60000365", "AffiliationName": "Haemostasis Section, Biotherapeutics Group, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control"}, "55407657300": {"Name": "Kitchen S.", "AuthorID": "55407657300", "AffiliationID": "60006444", "AffiliationName": "Department of Coagulation, Royal Hallamshire Hospital"}, "23994984200": {"Name": "Bowyer A.", "AuthorID": "23994984200", "AffiliationID": "60006444", "AffiliationName": "Department of Coagulation, Royal Hallamshire Hospital"}, "57193134405": {"Name": "Chowdary P.", "AuthorID": "57193134405", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Katharine Dormandy Haemophilia and Thrombosis Centre, Royal Free Hospital"}, "55950236200": {"Name": "Riddell A.", "AuthorID": "55950236200", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Katharine Dormandy Haemophilia and Thrombosis Centre, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7201956491": {"Name": "Jenkins P.V.", "AuthorID": "7201956491", "AffiliationID": "60000020", "AffiliationName": "Haematology Department, Haemostasis Laboratory, University Hospital of Wales"}, "57198770409": {"Name": "Murphy P.", "AuthorID": "57198770409", "AffiliationID": "60001239", "AffiliationName": "Haemostasis Department, Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals"}, "54584046600": {"Name": "Platton S.", "AuthorID": "54584046600", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "The Royal London Hospital Haemophilia Centre, The Royal London Hospital"}, "13604952900": {"Name": "Lester W.", "AuthorID": "13604952900", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "Haemophilia Unit, University Hospitals Birmingham"}}}
