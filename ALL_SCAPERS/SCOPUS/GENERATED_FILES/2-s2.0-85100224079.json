Published by Oxford University Press.Living in rapidly changing environments has shaped the mammalian brain toward high sensitivity to abrupt and intense sensory events-often signaling threats or affordances requiring swift reactions. Unsurprisingly, such events elicit a widespread electrocortical response (the vertex potential, VP), likely related to the preparation of appropriate behavioral reactions. Although the VP magnitude is largely determined by stimulus intensity, the relative contribution of the differential and absolute components of intensity remains unknown. Here, we dissociated the effects of these two components. We systematically varied the size of abrupt intensity increases embedded within continuous stimulation at different absolute intensities, while recording brain activity in humans (with scalp electroencephalography) and rats (with epidural electrocorticography). We obtained three main results. 1) VP magnitude largely depends on differential, and not absolute, stimulus intensity. This result held true, 2) for both auditory and somatosensory stimuli, indicating that sensitivity to differential intensity is supramodal, and 3) in both humans and rats, suggesting that sensitivity to abrupt intensity differentials is phylogenetically well-conserved. Altogether, the current results show that these large electrocortical responses are most sensitive to the detection of sensory changes that more likely signal the sudden appearance of novel objects or events in the environment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["behavioral relevance", "electrocorticography (ECoG)", "electroencephalography (EEG)", "multispecies investigation", "saliency-detection"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85100224079", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"57207578211": {"Name": "Somervail R.", "AuthorID": "57207578211", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience and Behaviour Laboratory, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia"}, "55226971800": {"Name": "Iannetti G.D.", "AuthorID": "55226971800", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience and Behaviour Laboratory, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia"}, "37056031000": {"Name": "Novembre G.", "AuthorID": "37056031000", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience and Behaviour Laboratory, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia"}, "57060570800": {"Name": "Bufacchi R.J.", "AuthorID": "57060570800", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience and Behaviour Laboratory, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia"}, "57221181274": {"Name": "Guo Y.", "AuthorID": "57221181274", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience and Behaviour Laboratory, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia"}, "57205476739": {"Name": "Zhang F.", "AuthorID": "57205476739", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "7401557322": {"Name": "Hu L.", "AuthorID": "7401557322", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "15844859800": {"Name": "Crepaldi M.", "AuthorID": "15844859800", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Electronic Design Laboratory, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia"}}}
