In this work, we report a surface active-site engineering approach for modulating electrocatalytic CO2 reduction using the macrocycle cucurbit[6]uril (CB[6]). A pristine gold surface functionalized with CB[6] nanocavities was studied as a hybrid organic-inorganic model system that utilizes host-guest chemistry to influence the heterogeneous electrocatalytic reaction. The combination of surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy and electrocatalytic experiments in conjunction with theoretical calculations supports capture and reduction of CO2 inside the hydrophobic cavity of CB[6] on the gold surface in aqueous KHCO3 at negative potentials. SEIRA spectroscopic experiments show that the decoration of gold with the supramolecular host CB[6] leads to an increased local CO2 concentration close to the metal interface. Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction on a CB[6]-coated gold electrode indicates differences in the specific interactions between CO2 reduction intermediates within and outside the CB[6] molecular cavity, illustrated by a decrease in current density from CO generation, but almost invariant H2 production compared to unfunctionalized gold. The presented methodology and mechanistic insight can guide future design of molecularly engineered catalytic environments through interfacial host-guest chemistry.", "AuthorKeywords": ["electrocatalytic CO2 reduction", "host-guest chemistry", "supramolecular catalysis", "surface active-site engineering"], "IndexKeywords": ["CO2 reduction", "Electrocatalytic reactions", "Hostguest chemistry", "Hybrid organic-inorganic", "Supramolecular catalysis", "Surface active sites", "Surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy", "Theoretical calculations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078919027", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"57203119437": {"Name": "Wagner A.", "AuthorID": "57203119437", "AffiliationID": "123839665", "AffiliationName": "Christian Doppler Laboratory for Sustainable SynGas Chemistry, Department of Chemistry"}, "24758801400": {"Name": "Ly K.H.", "AuthorID": "24758801400", "AffiliationID": "123839665", "AffiliationName": "Christian Doppler Laboratory for Sustainable SynGas Chemistry, Department of Chemistry"}, "41861359500": {"Name": "Heidary N.", "AuthorID": "41861359500", "AffiliationID": "60016458", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences and Chemistry, Jacobs University Bremen"}, "56371204000": {"Name": "Kornienko N.", "AuthorID": "56371204000", "AffiliationID": "123839665", "AffiliationName": "Christian Doppler Laboratory for Sustainable SynGas Chemistry, Department of Chemistry"}, "57213429749": {"Name": "Kuehnel M.F.", "AuthorID": "57213429749", "AffiliationID": "123839665", "AffiliationName": "Christian Doppler Laboratory for Sustainable SynGas Chemistry, Department of Chemistry"}, "7003440670": {"Name": "Reisner E.", "AuthorID": "7003440670", "AffiliationID": "123839665", "AffiliationName": "Christian Doppler Laboratory for Sustainable SynGas Chemistry, Department of Chemistry"}, "57202406543": {"Name": "Barrow S.J.", "AuthorID": "57202406543", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, King s College London"}, "8556311000": {"Name": "Rosta E.", "AuthorID": "8556311000", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Melville Laboratory for Polymer Synthesis, Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "6507768052": {"Name": "Scherman O.A.", "AuthorID": "6507768052", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Melville Laboratory for Polymer Synthesis, Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "57190172653": {"Name": "Szab\u00f3 I.", "AuthorID": "57190172653", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, King s College London"}, "6506138965": {"Name": "F\u00f6ldes T.", "AuthorID": "6506138965", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, King s College London"}, "7005107758": {"Name": "Nau W.M.", "AuthorID": "7005107758", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, King s College London"}, "57209503843": {"Name": "Assaf K.I.", "AuthorID": "57209503843", "AffiliationID": "60016458", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences and Chemistry, Jacobs University Bremen"}, "55191037900": {"Name": "Soko\u0142owski K.", "AuthorID": "55191037900", "AffiliationID": "60030078, 60014383", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physical Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "55437213800": {"Name": "Al-Hada M.", "AuthorID": "55437213800", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Cambridge"}, "6602719145": {"Name": "Zebger I.", "AuthorID": "6602719145", "AffiliationID": "123840418", "AffiliationName": "Max Volmer Laboratorium fur Biophysikalische Chemie, Sekr.
