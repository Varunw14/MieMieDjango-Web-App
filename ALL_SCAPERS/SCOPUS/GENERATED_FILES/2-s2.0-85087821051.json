We report evidence of AlO in transmission to a high level of statistical significance (>5\u03c3 in comparison to a flat model, and 3.4\u03c3 in comparison to a model with H2O only). We find no evidence of the presence of CO, CO2, or CH4 based on the available HST WFC3 data or on Spitzer IRAC data. We demonstrate that AlO is the molecule that fits the data to the highest level of confidence out of all molecules for which high-temperature opacity data currently exists in the infrared region covered by the HST WFC3 instrument, and that the subsequent inclusion of Spitzer IRAC data points in our retrieval further supports the presence of AlO. H2O is the only other molecule we find to be statistically significant in this region. AlO is not expected from the equilibrium chemistry at the temperatures and pressures of the atmospheric layer that is being probed by the observed data. Its presence therefore implies direct evidence of some disequilibrium processes with links to atmospheric dynamics. Implications for future study using instruments such as the James Webb Space Telescope are discussed, along with future opacity needs. Comparisons are made with previous studies into WASP-43b.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Infrared: planetary systems", "Molecular data", "Planets and satellites: atmospheres", "Planets and satellites: gaseous planets"], "IndexKeywords": ["Atmospheric dynamics", "Atmospheric layers", "Bayesian retrieval", "Equilibrium chemistry", "Hubble space telescopes", "Implications for futures", "James Webb space telescope", "Statistical significance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087821051", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57190285025": {"Name": "Chubb K.L.", "AuthorID": "57190285025", "AffiliationID": "60001512", "AffiliationName": "SRON Netherlands Institute for Space Research"}, "7005546708": {"Name": "Min M.", "AuthorID": "7005546708", "AffiliationID": "60001512", "AffiliationName": "SRON Netherlands Institute for Space Research"}, "55820081000": {"Name": "Kawashima Y.", "AuthorID": "55820081000", "AffiliationID": "60001512", "AffiliationName": "SRON Netherlands Institute for Space Research"}, "7003381311": {"Name": "Helling C.", "AuthorID": "7003381311", "AffiliationID": "60022132", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Exoplanet Science, University of St Andrews"}, "36467405700": {"Name": "Waldmann I.", "AuthorID": "36467405700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
