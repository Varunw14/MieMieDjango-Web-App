These last two depend on the location of the target quadruplex within an eukaryotic gene (promoter or untranslated region). It is apparent that of the likely 10,000 quadruplex targets in a human cancer cell, a large number are within cancer-relevant genes and thus are potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Numerous quadruplex-binding compounds have been shown to down-regulate expression of c-MYC and other cancer genes. It is unlikely though that these compounds directly bind to a single quadruplex and affect just a single gene. Whole-genome transcriptome profiling and genetic methods using hairpin RNA libraries have shown that the large number of genes typically down-regulated by quadruplex-binding compounds are enriched in putative quadruplex sequences, consistent with a model of multiple quadruplex targeting. Features of quadruplex-binding compounds required for eventual drug development are discussed. Case histories are presented for two quadruplex-binding compounds which affect telomere function in cancer cells and show in vivo activity against experimental cancer models. Neither have advanced beyond pre-clinical assessment due to off-target toxicity and narrow therapeutic windows. Case histories of two compounds with sensitivity for BRCA1/2 deficient cells that are currently in clinical trial are also presented, indicating the importance of patient profiling rather than target choice, for clinical success.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer", "Clinical approval", "Metabolism", "Quadruplex drug", "Toxicity", "Uptake"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087754434", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"35820006900": {"Name": "Neidle S.", "AuthorID": "35820006900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University College London"}}}
