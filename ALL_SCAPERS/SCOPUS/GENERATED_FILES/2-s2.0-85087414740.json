To better understand this group and inform future service changes, this paper aims to describe patient characteristics, outcomes and process measures across age cohorts and temporally in the 4-year period (2014-2017) since NELA was established. Methods: patient-level data were populated from the NELA data set years 1-4 and linked with Office of National Statistics mortality data. Descriptive data were compared between groups delineated by age, NELA year and geriatrician review. Primary outcomes were 30- and 90-day mortality, length of stay (LOS) and discharge to care-home accommodation. Results: in total, 93,415 NELA patients were included in the analysis. The median age was 67 years. Patients aged \u226565 years had higher 30-day (15.3 versus 4.9%, P < 0.001) and 90-day mortality (20.4 versus 7.2%, P < 0.001) rates, longer LOS (median 15.2 versus 11.3 days, P < 0.001) and greater likelihood of discharge to care-home accommodation compared with younger patients (6.7 versus 1.9%, P < 0.001). Mortality rate reduction over time was greater in older compared with younger patients. The proportion of older NELA patients seen by a geriatrician post-operatively increased over years 1-4 (8.5 to 16.5%, P < 0.001). Post-operative geriatrician review was associated with reduced mortality (30-day odds ratio [OR] 0.38, confidence interval [CI] 0.35-0.42, P < 0.001; 90-day OR 0.6, CI 0.56-0.65, P < 0.001). Conclusions: older NELA patients have poorer post-operative outcomes. The greatest reduction in mortality rates over time were observed in the oldest cohorts. This may be due to several interventions including increased perioperative geriatrician input.", "AuthorKeywords": ["General surgery", "Geriatric assessment", "Health services research", "Mortality rates", "Older people", "Perioperative medicine for older people undergoing surgery (POPS)"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087414740", "SubjectAreas": [["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"57212109544": {"Name": "Aitken R.M.", "AuthorID": "57212109544", "AffiliationID": "60116802", "AffiliationName": "National Emergency Laparotomy Audit, Royal College of Anaesthetists"}, "57212783005": {"Name": "Partridge J.S.L.", "AuthorID": "57212783005", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Primary Care and Public Health Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London"}, "6601975638": {"Name": "Dhesi J.K.", "AuthorID": "6601975638", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "56890517400": {"Name": "Oliver C.M.", "AuthorID": "56890517400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Systems Research, UCL Division of Targeted Intervention"}, "57207147322": {"Name": "Murray D.", "AuthorID": "57207147322", "AffiliationID": "60030723", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, James Cook University Hospital"}, "57207536734": {"Name": "Hare S.", "AuthorID": "57207536734", "AffiliationID": "60033002", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, Medway Maritime Hospital"}, "53865212000": {"Name": "Lockwood S.", "AuthorID": "53865212000", "AffiliationID": "60031382, 60016450", "AffiliationName": "General Surgery Unit, Bradford Royal Infirmary, Bradford Teaching Hospitals"}, "57216615822": {"Name": "Beckley-Hoelscher N.", "AuthorID": "57216615822", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Population Health and Environmental Sciences, King's College London"}}}
