Patients and methods: In total, 6575 ART-naive patients were selected, initiating two NRTIs with the third drug being a boosted PI (n=2436; 37.0%), an NNRTI (n=2384; 36.3%) or an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) (n=1755; 26.7%). HBV surface antigen and HCV RNA were detected in 3.9% and 5.8% of the study population. Inverse probability weighted Cox regression analysis was used to calculate the HRs, according to first-line regimen, for LEE, defined as ALT or AST increases of \u22652.5\u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN) for patients with normal baseline values or \u22652.5\u00d7 baseline for patients with higher baseline values. Results: One hundred and eighty-three LEE occurred over 20722 patient-years of follow-up. After adjusting for the main confounders, the risk of LEE halved with INSTIs compared with NNRTIs (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.25-0.86), with a significant reduction in the raltegravir group (HR 0.11, 95% CI 0.02-0.84 using the NNRTI class as reference). HRs for LEE were significantly higher in subjects with HBV or HCV coinfection, in patients with poorly controlled HIV infection and in those who acquired HIV through homosexual transmission. Conclusions: In our study, INSTI use almost halved the risk of LEE compared with other regimens. This finding could be particularly important for choosing ART in patients with risk factors for liver toxicity such as HCV and HBV coinfections.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anti-HIV Agents", "Coinfection", "Female", "Hepatitis B Surface Antigens", "Hepatitis C", "HIV Infections", "HIV Integrase Inhibitors", "HIV Protease Inhibitors", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Incidence", "Liver Diseases", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Regression Analysis", "Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073584650", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"52464543300": {"Name": "Taramasso L.", "AuthorID": "52464543300", "AffiliationID": "60007067", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"}, "8652901500": {"Name": "Lorenzini P.", "AuthorID": "8652901500", "AffiliationID": "60072494", "AffiliationName": "HIV/AIDS Clinical Department, National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani"}, "57203678052": {"Name": "Antinori A.", "AuthorID": "57203678052", "AffiliationID": "60072494", "AffiliationName": "HIV/AIDS Clinical Department, National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani"}, "57202566978": {"Name": "Di Biagio A.", "AuthorID": "57202566978", "AffiliationID": "60107402", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Diseases Clinic, Policlinico San Martino Hospital"}, "57202594513": {"Name": "Lichtner M.", "AuthorID": "57202594513", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, La Sapienza University, Polo Pontino"}, "57202558980": {"Name": "Marchetti G.", "AuthorID": "57202558980", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, Clinic of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, University of Milan"}, "57203678221": {"Name": "D'Arminio Monforte A.", "AuthorID": "57203678221", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, Clinic of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, University of Milan"}, "24167248700": {"Name": "Rossotti R.", "AuthorID": "24167248700", "AffiliationID": "116887478", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Diseases Department, ASST GOM Niguarda"}, "57202567477": {"Name": "Lapadula G.", "AuthorID": "57202567477", "AffiliationID": "60014378", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Diseases Unit, Ospedale San Gerardo"}, "55134188900": {"Name": "Cozzi-Lepri A.", "AuthorID": "55134188900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7005431591": {"Name": "Vichi F.", "AuthorID": "7005431591", "AffiliationID": "60083544", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Infectious Diseases, Santa Maria Annunziata Hospital"}, "56539512900": {"Name": "Bonora S.", "AuthorID": "56539512900", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Torino"}}}
