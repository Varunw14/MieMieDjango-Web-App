Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Malnutrition has historically been researched and addressed within two distinct silos, focusing either on undernutrition, food insecurity, and micronutrient deficiencies, or on overweight, obesity, and dietary excess. However, through rapid global nutrition transition, an increasing proportion of individuals are exposed to different forms of malnutrition during the life course and have the double burden of malnutrition (DBM) directly. Long-lasting effects of malnutrition in early life can be attributed to interconnected biological pathways, involving imbalance of the gut microbiome, inflammation, metabolic dysregulation, and impaired insulin signalling. Life-course exposure to early undernutrition followed by later overweight increases the risk of non-communicable disease, by imposing a high metabolic load on a depleted capacity for homoeostasis, and in women increases the risk of childbirth complications. These life-course trajectories are shaped both by societal driving factors\u2014ie, rapidly changing diets, norms of eating, and physical activity patterns\u2014and by broader ecological factors such as pathogen burden and extrinsic mortality risk. Mitigation of the DBM will require major societal shifts regarding nutrition and public health, to implement comprehensive change that is sustained over decades, and scaled up into the entire global food system.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Africa South of the Sahara", "Age of Onset", "Exercise", "Female", "Gastrointestinal Microbiome", "Humans", "Indonesia", "Male", "Malnutrition", "Metabolic Networks and Pathways", "Nutritional Status", "Obesity", "Overweight", "Prevalence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077166280", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55603815000": {"Name": "Wells J.C.", "AuthorID": "55603815000", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Childhood Nutrition Research Centre, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57209615135": {"Name": "Poullas M.S.", "AuthorID": "57209615135", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Childhood Nutrition Research Centre, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7004360161": {"Name": "Sawaya A.L.", "AuthorID": "7004360161", "AffiliationID": "60014992", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "56580306000": {"Name": "Wibaek R.", "AuthorID": "56580306000", "AffiliationID": "60016428", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Epidemiology, Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen"}, "37028179400": {"Name": "Demaio A.", "AuthorID": "37028179400", "AffiliationID": "113848760", "AffiliationName": "VicHealth"}, "36028408500": {"Name": "Mwangome M.", "AuthorID": "36028408500", "AffiliationID": "60070343", "AffiliationName": "Kenya Medical Research Institute Wellcome Trust Research Program"}, "57204341389": {"Name": "Yajnik C.S.", "AuthorID": "57204341389", "AffiliationID": "60194976", "AffiliationName": "Diabetes Unit, KEM Hospital and Research Centre"}}}
