Design: Retrospective case series. Participants: Patients with a detailed clinical phenotype consistent with ARB, biallelic likely disease-causing sequence variants in the BEST1 gene, or both identified at a single tertiary referral center. Methods: Review of case notes, retinal imaging (color fundus photography, fundus autofluorescence, OCT), electrophysiologic assessment, and molecular genetic testing. Main Outcome Measures: Visual acuity (VA), retinal imaging, and electrophysiologic changes over time. Results: Fifty-six eyes of 28 unrelated patients were included. Compound heterozygous variants were detected in most patients (19/27), with 6 alleles recurring in apparently unrelated individuals, the most common of which was c.422G\u2192A, p.(Arg141His; n = 4 patients). Mean presenting VA was 0.52 \u00b1 0.36 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR), and final VA was 0.81 \u00b1 0.75 logMAR (P = 0.06). The mean rate of change in VA was 0.05 \u00b1 0.13 logMAR/year. A significant change in VA was detected in patients with a follow-up of 5 years or more (n = 18) compared with patients with a follow-up of 5 years or less (n = 10; P = 0.001). Presence of subretinal fluid and vitelliform material were early findings in most patients, and this did not change substantially over time. A reduction in central retinal thickness was detected in most eyes (80.4%) over the course of follow-up. Many patients (10/26) showed evidence of generalized rod and cone system dysfunction. These patients were older (P < 0.001) and had worse VA (P = 0.02) than those with normal full-field electroretinography results. Conclusions: Although patients with ARB are presumed to have no functioning bestrophin channels, significant phenotypic heterogeneity is evident. The clinical course is characterized by a progressive loss of vision with a slow rate of decline, providing a wide therapeutic window for anticipated future treatment strategies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autosomal recessive bestrophinopathy", "BEST1", "Electrophysiology", "Gene therapy", "Genetics", "Retinal imaging"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096600485", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"57205636378": {"Name": "Casalino G.", "AuthorID": "57205636378", "AffiliationID": "60110962", "AffiliationName": "Oftalmico Hospital, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco"}, "23483320800": {"Name": "Wright G.", "AuthorID": "23483320800", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "37665820900": {"Name": "Pontikos N.", "AuthorID": "37665820900", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57200827164": {"Name": "Georgiou M.", "AuthorID": "57200827164", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57208891770": {"Name": "Webster A.R.", "AuthorID": "57208891770", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57203259026": {"Name": "Robson A.G.", "AuthorID": "57203259026", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "54408495600": {"Name": "Grewal P.S.", "AuthorID": "54408495600", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57215380010": {"Name": "Michaelides M.", "AuthorID": "57215380010", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "36646250000": {"Name": "Khan K.N.", "AuthorID": "36646250000", "AffiliationID": "60012508", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "57200553463": {"Name": "Armengol M.", "AuthorID": "57200553463", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Guy's and St. Thomas\u2019 Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
