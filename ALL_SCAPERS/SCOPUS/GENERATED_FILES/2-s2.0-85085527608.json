We impose the group \"Equivocal to reduce misclassifications by allowing for uncertainty, akin to prostate imaging reporting systems used by radiologists. We trained 3D convolutional neural networks to perform two binary patient-level classification tasks: classification of patients with/without prostate cancer and classification of patients with/without clinically significant prostate cancer. Networks were trained separately using volumetric T2-weighted images and apparent diffusion coefficient maps for both tasks. The probabilistic outputs of the resulting four trained networks were combined using majority voting followed by the max operator to classify patients into one of the three classes mentioned above. All networks were trained using patient-level labels only, which is a key advantage of our system since voxel-level tumour annotation is often unavailable due to the time and effort required of a radiologist. Our system was evaluated by retrospective analysis on a previously collected trial dataset. At a higher sensitivity setting, our system achieved 0.97 sensitivity and 0.31 specificity compared to an experienced radiologist who achieved 0.99 sensitivity and 0.12 specificity. At a lower sensitivity setting, our system achieved 0.78 sensitivity and 0.77 specificity compared to 0.76 sensitivity and 0.77 specificity for the experienced radiologist. We envision our system acting as a second reader in pre-biopsy screening applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biparametric mri", "computer-aided diagnosis", "convolutional neural network", "decision fusion", "multiparametric mri", "prostate cancer"], "IndexKeywords": ["Apparent diffusion coefficient maps", "Classification tasks", "Computer aided diagnosis systems", "Misclassifications", "Probabilistic output", "Retrospective analysis", "Screening application", "Sensitivity setting"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085527608", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57216955536": {"Name": "Mehta P.", "AuthorID": "57216955536", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004667094": {"Name": "Emberton M.", "AuthorID": "7004667094", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "17036141700": {"Name": "Punwani S.", "AuthorID": "17036141700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "23392100500": {"Name": "Antonelli M.", "AuthorID": "23392100500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "8147855500": {"Name": "Ahmed H.", "AuthorID": "8147855500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}}}
