We assessed the impact of pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) on pulmonary arterial wave propagation and reservoir function in patients with CTEPH. Right heart catheterization was performed using a combined pressure and Doppler flow sensor-tipped guidewire to obtain simultaneous pressure and flow velocity measurements in the pulmonary artery in eight patients with CTEPH before and 3 mo after PEA. Wave intensity and reservoir-excess pressure analyses were then performed. Following PEA, mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAPm; \u223c49 vs. \u223c32 mmHg), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR; \u223c11.1 vs. \u223c5.1 Wood units), and wave speed (\u223c16.5 vs. \u223c8.1 m/s), i.e., local arterial stiffness, markedly decreased. The changes in the intensity of the reflected arterial wave and wave reflection index (pre: \u223c28%; post: \u223c22%) were small, and patients post-PEA with and without residual pulmonary hypertension (i.e., PAPm \u2265 25 mmHg) had similar wave reflection index (\u223c20 vs. \u223c23%). The reservoir and excess pressure decreased post-PEA, and the changes were associated with improved right ventricular afterload, function, and size. In conclusion, although PVR and arterial stiffness decreased substantially following PEA, large wave reflection persisted, even in patients without residual pulmonary hypertension, indicating lack of improvement in vascular impedance mismatch. This may continue to affect the optimal ventriculoarterial interaction, and further studies are warranted to determine whether this contributes to persistent symptoms in some patients.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We performed wave intensity analysis in the pulmonary artery in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension before and 3 mo after pulmonary endarterectomy. Despite substantial reduction in pulmonary arterial pressures, vascular resistance, and arterial stiffness, large pulmonary arterial wave reflection persisted 3 mo postsurgery, even in patients without residual pulmonary hypertension, suggestive of lack of improvement in vascular impedance mismatch.", "AuthorKeywords": ["arterial stiffness", "pulmonary endarterectomy", "pulmonary hypertension", "wave intensity analysis", "wave reflection"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Arterial Pressure", "Blood Flow Velocity", "Case-Control Studies", "Catheterization, Swan-Ganz", "Denmark", "Endarterectomy", "Female", "Humans", "London", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Models, Cardiovascular", "Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension", "Pulmonary Artery", "Pulmonary Circulation", "Pulmonary Embolism", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome", "Ultrasonography, Doppler", "Vascular Stiffness", "Ventricular Function, Right"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071704092", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"57191884407": {"Name": "Su J.", "AuthorID": "57191884407", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "7003695764": {"Name": "Simonsen U.", "AuthorID": "7003695764", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University"}, "8056207000": {"Name": "Howard L.S.", "AuthorID": "8056207000", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University"}, "7401765648": {"Name": "Hughes A.D.", "AuthorID": "7401765648", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "7003442782": {"Name": "Nielsen-Kudsk J.E.", "AuthorID": "7003442782", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Aarhus University Hospital"}, "6602406207": {"Name": "Mellemkjaer S.", "AuthorID": "6602406207", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Aarhus University Hospital"}, "7401598095": {"Name": "Parker K.H.", "AuthorID": "7401598095", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"}}}
