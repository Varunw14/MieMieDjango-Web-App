As a hazardous event associated with a terrorist attack, one of the unfavourable impact scenarios is adopted in which a Boeing 777 airplane strikes the hull structure at a full speed. This study examines the contribution of ballasting materials such as sand or concrete to the penetration of the striking body into the hull structure in an aircraft strike as the power plant is gravity based sitting on the seabed. The LS-DYNA nonlinear finite-element method is employed for the structural crashworthiness analysis. Details of the computational modelling and resulting insights are documented.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aircraft strike", "Floating nuclear power plant", "nonlinear finite-element method", "structural crashworthiness", "terrorist attack"], "IndexKeywords": ["Computational modelling", "Double sided", "Hazardous events", "Hull structures", "Impact scenarios", "Nonlinear finite element method", "Structural crashworthiness", "Terrorist attacks"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084969747", "SubjectAreas": [["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"57211443878": {"Name": "Kee Paik J.", "AuthorID": "57211443878", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "Department of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Pusan National University"}, "57205407902": {"Name": "Park J.H.", "AuthorID": "57205407902", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "Department of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Pusan National University"}}}
