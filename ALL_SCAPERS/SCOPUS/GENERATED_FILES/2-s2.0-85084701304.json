Methods: Data from 4912 eligible AF patients who were admitted in a stroke unit with ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack and who were treated with either VKAs or NOACs within 3 months post-stroke were included. Fatal ICH was defined as death occurring during the first 30 days after ICH onset. A meta-analysis of available observational studies reporting 30-day mortality rates from NOAC-ICH or VKA-ICH onset was additionally performed. Results: During 5970 patient-years of follow-up 71 participants had an ICH, of whom 20 were NOAC-ICH and 51 VKA-ICH. Patients in the two groups had comparable baseline characteristics, except for the higher prevalence of kidney disease in VKA-ICH patients. There was a non-significant higher number of fatal ICH in patients with VKAs (11 events per 3385 patient-years) than in those with NOACs (three events per 2623 patient-years; hazard ratio 0.32, 95% confidence interval 0.09\u20131.14). Three-month functional outcomes were similar (P > 0.2) in the two groups. The meta-analysis showed a lower 30-day mortality risk for patients with NOAC-ICH compared to VKA-ICH (relative risk 0.70, 95% confidence interval 0.51\u20130.95). Conclusions: Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants for intracranial haemorrhages and VKA-ICH occurring during secondary stroke prevention of AF patients have comparable baseline characteristics and outcomes except for the risk of fatal ICH within 30 days, which might be greater in VKA-ICH.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anticoagulation", "cerebral haemorrhage", "cerebral infarction", "cerebrovascular diseases and cerebral circulation", "neurological disorders"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084701304", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"6701335522": {"Name": "Tsivgoulis G.", "AuthorID": "6701335522", "AffiliationID": "60002194", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Tennessee Health Science Center"}, "55311611200": {"Name": "Katsanos A.H.", "AuthorID": "55311611200", "AffiliationID": "60085943, 60031828", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurology, McMaster University/Population Health Research Institute"}, "36633290700": {"Name": "Seiffge D.J.", "AuthorID": "36633290700", "AffiliationID": "60010987, 60020486", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern"}, "57190738259": {"Name": "Polymeris A.A.", "AuthorID": "57190738259", "AffiliationID": "60023588, 60028287", "AffiliationName": "Neurology and Stroke Center, University Hospital and University of Basel"}, "6603761832": {"Name": "Engelter S.T.", "AuthorID": "6603761832", "AffiliationID": "60101861, 60023588", "AffiliationName": "Neurorehabilitation Unit, University Center for Medicine of Aging and Rehabilitation Basel, Felix Platter Hospital, University of Basel"}, "8842483700": {"Name": "De Marchis G.M.", "AuthorID": "8842483700", "AffiliationID": "60023588, 60028287", "AffiliationName": "Neurology and Stroke Center, University Hospital and University of Basel"}, "57202955229": {"Name": "Wilson D.", "AuthorID": "57202955229", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Research Center, Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Institute of Neurology and the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "6603707621": {"Name": "Werring D.J.", "AuthorID": "6603707621", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Research Center, Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Institute of Neurology and the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7003511588": {"Name": "Paciaroni M.", "AuthorID": "7003511588", "AffiliationID": "60003003", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Unit and Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Perugia"}, "55401514700": {"Name": "Caso V.", "AuthorID": "55401514700", "AffiliationID": "60003003", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Unit and Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Perugia"}, "7202130234": {"Name": "Koga M.", "AuthorID": "7202130234", "AffiliationID": "60016372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cerebrovascular Medicine, National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center"}, "57204322396": {"Name": "Toyoda K.", "AuthorID": "57204322396", "AffiliationID": "60016372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cerebrovascular Medicine, National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center"}, "56398347100": {"Name": "Macha K.", "AuthorID": "56398347100", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg"}, "24178373700": {"Name": "Kallm\u00fcnzer B.", "AuthorID": "24178373700", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg"}, "35620121200": {"Name": "Cappellari M.", "AuthorID": "35620121200", "AffiliationID": "113110380", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Unit, Department of Neuroscience, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata"}}}
