Group members were asked to give their responses to a range of strategies collected from global efforts to control the disease in cattle and humans in the context of intensification of the dairy industry, as well as those suggested by researchers within the project. Key findings from the study include the observation that a number of strategies utilised routinely to control bTB elsewhere in the world, including \u2018Test and Slaughter\u2019 and \u2018Test and Segregation\u2019 are likely to be impractical in low-resource settings where infrastructure may be unreliable and space both between and on individual farms is limited. It also became clear that farmers called upon to implement biosecurity measures should be supplied with locally-specific information and instructions in order to effectively control and prevent the spread of disease. Additionally, this research supports the need for investment in animal health system strengthening in Ethiopia and other similar settings, in order to enable animal health workers, including veterinarians, to devote time to disease surveillance and farmer sensitisation. Similarly, investment in milk pasteurisation processes and public education on these processes should be prioritised in order to increase their acceptability and feasibility among both producers and consumers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biosecurity", "Bovine tuberculosis", "Ethiopia", "Qualitative research", "Zoonoses"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094860631", "SubjectAreas": [["Food Animals", "VETE", "3403"], ["Animal Science and Zoology", "AGRI", "1103"]], "AuthorData": {"57216038309": {"Name": "Hodge C.", "AuthorID": "57216038309", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Prosperity, University College London"}, "7202287031": {"Name": "Moore H.L.", "AuthorID": "7202287031", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Prosperity, University College London"}, "57220381687": {"Name": "Deneke T.T.", "AuthorID": "57220381687", "AffiliationID": "60071191", "AffiliationName": "Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research"}, "57199700386": {"Name": "Endalew M.A.", "AuthorID": "57199700386", "AffiliationID": "60071191", "AffiliationName": "Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
