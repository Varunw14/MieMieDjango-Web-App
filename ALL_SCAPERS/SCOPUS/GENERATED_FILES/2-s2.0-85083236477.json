Given that pharmacological treatments for LLD are limited by their side effects, development of efficient and tolerable nonpharmacological treatment for LLD is urgently required. This study investigated whether high-frequency external muscle stimulation could reduce depressive symptoms in LLD. Methods: Twenty-two older male veterans with major depression were recruited and randomized into a treatment (n = 9) or sham control group (n = 13). The groups received high-frequency external muscle stimulation or sham intervention 3 times per week for 12 weeks. Clinical symptoms and muscle strength were evaluated at baseline and every 2 weeks. Results: The 2 groups were homogeneous in age, baseline clinical symptoms, and muscle strength. The treatment group showed significant improvement in depression and anxiety scores and muscle strength (all P <.01), whereas the control group showed no significant change after the 12-week follow-up. Compared to the control group, the treatment group showed significant improvements in depression (Geriatric Depression Scale, P =.009; Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, P =.007) and anxiety scores (HAMA, P =.008) and muscle strength (all P <.001). Changes in depression and anxiety levels were significantly correlated with changes in muscle strength after the study. In the treatment group, we observed a trend of correlation between the reduction in depression and muscle strength gains. Conclusion: High-frequency external muscle stimulation appears to be an effective treatment for older patients with LLD. Large studies with more tests and/or conducted in different populations are warranted to validate these preliminary findings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["electric muscle stimulation", "major depression", "muscle strength", "older people"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083236477", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57208836242": {"Name": "Liu M.N.", "AuthorID": "57208836242", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Memory & Aging Center, University of California"}, "57217258029": {"Name": "Tsai S.J.", "AuthorID": "57217258029", "AffiliationID": "60069716", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University"}, "7102949484": {"Name": "Liou Y.J.", "AuthorID": "7102949484", "AffiliationID": "60069716", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University"}, "24722121800": {"Name": "Yeh H.L.", "AuthorID": "24722121800", "AffiliationID": "114250004", "AffiliationName": "Health Care Group, Taipei Veterans Home"}, "56632320600": {"Name": "Kuan A.S.", "AuthorID": "56632320600", "AffiliationID": "60013314", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurosurgery, Neurological Institute, Taipei Veterans General Hospital"}, "7005240472": {"Name": "Walsh V.", "AuthorID": "7005240472", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Applied Cognitive Neuroscience Group, Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "36644418400": {"Name": "Lau C.I.", "AuthorID": "36644418400", "AffiliationID": "124113619", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital"}}}
