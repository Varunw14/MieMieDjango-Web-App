This study examined the associations between psychosocial factors and hypertension among Ghanaian non-migrants and migrants. Data were drawn from the Research on Obesity and Diabetes among African Migrants (RODAM) project. Findings show that among migrant women, those who experienced periods of stress at home/work had higher odds of hypertension. Among non-migrants, women with depression symptoms were more likely to be hypertensive. Furthermore, there was a positive association between negative life events and hypertension among non-migrant men. The findings highlight the importance of psychosocial factors in addressing hypertension prevalence in Ghanaian populations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["depression symptoms", "Ghanaian migrants in Europe", "Ghanaians in Ghana", "hypertension", "negative life events", "stress"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075218739", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56107619400": {"Name": "Awuah R.B.", "AuthorID": "56107619400", "AffiliationID": "60017910", "AffiliationName": "University of Ghana"}, "15118884800": {"Name": "de-Graft Aikins A.", "AuthorID": "15118884800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6603703173": {"Name": "Dodoo F.N.A.", "AuthorID": "6603703173", "AffiliationID": "60001439", "AffiliationName": "Pennsylvania State University"}, "56096843200": {"Name": "Meeks K.A.C.", "AuthorID": "56096843200", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "University of Amsterdam"}, "15070089000": {"Name": "Beune E.J.A.J.", "AuthorID": "15070089000", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "University of Amsterdam"}, "55940388300": {"Name": "Agyemang C.", "AuthorID": "55940388300", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "University of Amsterdam"}, "7003935853": {"Name": "Klipstein-Grobusch K.", "AuthorID": "7003935853", "AffiliationID": "60007989", "AffiliationName": "Utrecht University"}, "23011201600": {"Name": "Addo J.", "AuthorID": "23011201600", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene Tropical Medicine"}, "7003651182": {"Name": "Smeeth L.", "AuthorID": "7003651182", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene Tropical Medicine"}, "56719634400": {"Name": "Bahendeka S.K.", "AuthorID": "56719634400", "AffiliationID": "60116805", "AffiliationName": "Uganda Martyrs University"}}}
