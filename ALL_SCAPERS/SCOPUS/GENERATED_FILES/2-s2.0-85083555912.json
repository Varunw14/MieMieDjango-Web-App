These developments can potentially herald a transformational change in the diagnostic pathway for diseases such as cancer. In this paper, we review the clinical and engineering aspects of novel optical spectroscopy-based imaging tools. We provide a comprehensive analysis of optical and non-optical spectroscopy-based breast cancer diagnosis techniques vis-\u00e0-vis the current standard techniques such as X-Ray mammography, ultrasonography, and tissue biopsy. The recent advancements in optical spectroscopy-based imaging systems such as Transillumination Imaging (TI) and the various types of Diffuse Optical Imaging (DOI) systems (parallel-plate, bed-based, and handheld) are examined. The engineering aspects, including mechanical, electronics, optics, automatic interpretation using artificial intelligence (AI), and ergonomics are discussed. The abilities of these technologies for measuring several cancer biomarkers such as hemoglobin, water, lipid, collagen, oxygen saturation (SO2), and tissue oxygenation index (TOI) are investigated. This article critically assesses the diagnostic ability and practical deployment of these new technologies to differentiate between the normal and cancerous tissue.", "AuthorKeywords": ["breast cancer", "diffuse optical imaging", "machine learning", "near-infrared spectroscopy", "rapid diagnosis", "Transillumination imaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Breast cancer diagnosis", "Comprehensive analysis", "Diagnostic ability", "Diffuse optical imaging (DOI)", "Engineering aspects", "Optical spectroscopy", "Tissue oxygenation index", "X-ray mammography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083555912", "SubjectAreas": [["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"]], "AuthorData": {"57216460536": {"Name": "Pal U.M.", "AuthorID": "57216460536", "AffiliationID": "60014097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Systems Engineering, Indian Institute of Science"}, "57210899922": {"Name": "Saxena M.", "AuthorID": "57210899922", "AffiliationID": "60105479", "AffiliationName": "Signal processing and Bio-medical Imaging Lab, Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi"}, "57207578257": {"Name": "Anil Vishnu G.K.", "AuthorID": "57207578257", "AffiliationID": "60014097", "AffiliationName": "Center for BioSystems Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Science"}, "57216462647": {"Name": "Parsana D.", "AuthorID": "57216462647", "AffiliationID": "60014097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Systems Engineering, Indian Institute of Science"}, "57190222929": {"Name": "Sarvani B.S.R.", "AuthorID": "57190222929", "AffiliationID": "60014097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Systems Engineering, Indian Institute of Science"}, "35230333900": {"Name": "Pandya H.J.", "AuthorID": "35230333900", "AffiliationID": "60014097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Systems Engineering, Indian Institute of Science"}, "7101706114": {"Name": "Varma M.", "AuthorID": "7101706114", "AffiliationID": "60014097", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nano Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Science"}, "57205726225": {"Name": "Jayachandra M.", "AuthorID": "57205726225", "AffiliationID": "60014097", "AffiliationName": "Center for BioSystems Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Science"}, "57221533700": {"Name": "Kurpad V.", "AuthorID": "57221533700", "AffiliationID": "116405552", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgical Oncology, Sri Shankara Cancer Hospital and Research Center"}, "57217638801": {"Name": "Baruah D.", "AuthorID": "57217638801", "AffiliationID": "115961943", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Tezpur Medical College"}, "56520307400": {"Name": "Gogoi G.", "AuthorID": "56520307400", "AffiliationID": "60072247", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Assam Medical College"}, "7006928746": {"Name": "Vaidya J.S.", "AuthorID": "7006928746", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}}}
