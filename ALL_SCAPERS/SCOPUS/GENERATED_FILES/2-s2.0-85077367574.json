Social capital, particularly participation has been considered as a possible protective factor in the prevention and management of chronic conditions. It is also largely shown to have a negative effect on the well-being of patients. The current discourse on the well-being of individuals with NCDs is however focused more on a comparison with those with no NCDs without considering the difference between individuals with one chronic condition versus those with multiple chronic conditions (MCC). Method and objective: We employed a multinomial logit model to examine the effect of social capital, particularly social participation, on the subjective well-being (SWB) of older adults with single chronic condition and MCC in six LMIC. Findings: Social capital was associated with increased subjective well-being of adults in all the six countries. The positive association between social capital and subjective well-being was higher for those with a single chronic condition than those with multiple chronic conditions in India and South Africa. Conversely, an increase in the likelihood of having higher subjective well-being as social capital increased was greater for those with multiple chronic conditions compared to those with a single chronic condition in Ghana. Discussion: The findings suggest that improving the social capital of older adults with chronic diseases could potentially improve their subjective well-being. This study, therefore, provides valuable insights into potential social determinants of subjective well-being of older adults with chronic diseases in six different countries undergoing transition. Additional research is needed to determine if these factors do in fact have causal effects on SWB in these populations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chronic non-communicable disease", "Older adults", "Social capital"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Chronic Disease", "Developing Countries", "Diagnostic Self Evaluation", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Noncommunicable Diseases", "Social Capital"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077367574", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"56954678200": {"Name": "Christian A.K.", "AuthorID": "56954678200", "AffiliationID": "60017910, 60110970", "AffiliationName": "Regional Institute for Population Studies (RIPS), University of Ghana"}, "56026622700": {"Name": "Sanuade O.A.", "AuthorID": "56026622700", "AffiliationID": "60017910", "AffiliationName": "NCDs Support Centre for Africa, Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research, University of Ghana"}, "57212759116": {"Name": "Okyere M.A.", "AuthorID": "57212759116", "AffiliationID": "60018205", "AffiliationName": "School of Management China, Institute for Studies in Energy Policy (CISEP), Xiamen University"}, "55188576000": {"Name": "Adjaye-Gbewonyo K.", "AuthorID": "55188576000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Advanced Studies, University College London"}}}
