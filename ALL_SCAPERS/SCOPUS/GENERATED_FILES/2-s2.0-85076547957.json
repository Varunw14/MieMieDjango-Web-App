The objectives of this study were (i) to develop a tool (CCU-OHQoL) to assess OHQoL amongst patients admitted to CCU, (ii) to collect data to analyse the validity, reliability and acceptability of the CCU-OHQoL tool and (iii) to investigate patient-reported outcome measures of OHQoL in patients hospitalised in a CCU. Methods: The project included three phases: (1) the development of an initial questionnaire informed by a literature review and expert panel, (2) testing of the tool in CCU (n = 18) followed by semi-structured interviews to assess acceptability, face and content validity and (3) final tool modification and testing of CCU-OHQoL questionnaire to assess validity and reliability. Results: The CCU-OHQoL showed good face and content validity and was quick to administer. Cronbach\u2019s alpha was 0.72 suggesting good internal consistency. For construct validity, the CCU-OHQoL was strongly and significantly correlated (correlation coefficients 0.71, 0.62 and 0.77, p < 0.01) with global OHQoL items. In the validation study, 37.8% of the participants reported a deterioration in self-reported oral health after CCU admission. Finally, 26.9% and 31% of the participants reported considerable negative impacts of oral health in their life overall and quality of life, respectively. Conclusions: The new CCU-OHQoL tool may be of use in the assessment of oral health-related quality of life in CCU patients. Deterioration of OHQoL seems to be common in CCU patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adults", "Critical care unit", "Oral health-related quality of life", "Questionnaire", "Validation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Critical Care", "Female", "Health Surveys", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Intensive Care Units", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Oral Health", "Quality of Life", "Reproducibility of Results", "Self Report"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076547957", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57211680099": {"Name": "Moreno Sancho F.", "AuthorID": "57211680099", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Periodontology, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "35848742100": {"Name": "Needleman I.", "AuthorID": "35848742100", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Oral Health and Performance, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, UCL"}, "57204336866": {"Name": "Tsakos G.", "AuthorID": "57204336866", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "6603308208": {"Name": "Brealey D.", "AuthorID": "6603308208", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bloomsbury Institute of Intensive Care Medicine, UCL"}, "6602105898": {"Name": "Boniface D.", "AuthorID": "6602105898", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biostatistics, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, UCL"}}}
