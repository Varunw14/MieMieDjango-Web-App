Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Public Health Association.Metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. It is unknown whether the MetSyn prevalence differs within a homogenous population residing in different settings in Africa and Europe. We therefore assessed the prevalence of MetSyn among Ghanaians living in rural- and urban-Ghana and Ghanaian migrants living in Europe. Methods: We used data from the cross-sectional multi-centre RODAM study that was conducted among Ghanaian adults aged 25-70 years residing in rural- and urban-Ghana and in London, Amsterdam and Berlin (n = 5659). MetSyn was defined according to the 2009 harmonized definition. Geographical locations were compared using age-standardized prevalence rates, and prevalence ratios (PRs), adjusted for age, education, physical activity, and smoking and stratified for sex. Results: In men, the age-standardized prevalence of MetSyn was 8.3% in rural Ghana and showed a positive gradient through urban Ghana (23.6%, adjusted PR = 1.85, 95% confidence interval 1.17-2.92) to Europe, with the highest prevalence in Amsterdam (31.4%; PR = 4.45, 2.94-6.75). In women, there was a rural-to-urban gradient in age-standardized MetSyn prevalence (rural Ghana 25%, urban Ghana 34.4%, PR = 1.38, 1.13-1.68), but small differences in MetSyn prevalence between urban-Ghanaian and European-Ghanaian women (Amsterdam 38.4%; London 38.2%). Conclusion: MetSyn is highly prevalent in Ghana as well as in Ghanaian migrants in Europe. To assist prevention efforts, further research is needed to understand the mechanisms driving the geographical differences in MetSyn prevalence between migrant and non-migrant Ghanaians.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Emigrants and Immigrants", "Europe", "Female", "Ghana", "Humans", "Male", "Metabolic Syndrome", "Middle Aged", "Obesity", "Prevalence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072716930", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"56964832200": {"Name": "Van Der Linden E.L.", "AuthorID": "56964832200", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60117142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute"}, "56096843200": {"Name": "Meeks K.", "AuthorID": "56096843200", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60117142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute"}, "15070089000": {"Name": "Beune E.", "AuthorID": "15070089000", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60117142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute"}, "7003354375": {"Name": "Stronks K.", "AuthorID": "7003354375", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60117142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute"}, "55940388300": {"Name": "Agyemang C.", "AuthorID": "55940388300", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60117142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute"}, "15118884800": {"Name": "De-Graft Aikins A.", "AuthorID": "15118884800", "AffiliationID": "60017910", "AffiliationName": "Regional Institute for Population Studies, University of Ghana"}, "57211122652": {"Name": "Tetteh Appiah L.", "AuthorID": "57211122652", "AffiliationID": "60071879", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital"}, "23011201600": {"Name": "Addo J.", "AuthorID": "23011201600", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Non-Communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7003651182": {"Name": "Smeeth L.", "AuthorID": "7003651182", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Non-Communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "23985449200": {"Name": "Owusu-Dabo E.", "AuthorID": "23985449200", "AffiliationID": "60071885", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Health, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology"}, "7003334445": {"Name": "Mockenhaupt F.P.", "AuthorID": "7003334445", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Tropical Medicine and International Health, Charit\u00e9 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin"}, "56719634400": {"Name": "Bahendeka S.", "AuthorID": "56719634400", "AffiliationID": "60116805", "AffiliationName": "MKPGMS-Uganda Martyrs University"}, "22956801000": {"Name": "Danquah I.", "AuthorID": "22956801000", "AffiliationID": "60072296", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Epidemiology, German Institute of Human Nutrition Potsdam-Rehbr\u00fccke"}, "7103093978": {"Name": "Schulze M.B.", "AuthorID": "7103093978", "AffiliationID": "60072296", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Epidemiology, German Institute of Human Nutrition Potsdam-Rehbr\u00fccke"}, "55101740600": {"Name": "Spranger J.", "AuthorID": "55101740600", "AffiliationID": "60026245, 60106629", "AffiliationName": "Center for Cardiovascular Research (CCR), Charit\u00e9-Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin"}, "7003935853": {"Name": "Klipstein-Grobusch K.", "AuthorID": "7003935853", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand"}}}
