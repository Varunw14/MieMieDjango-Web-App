This paper describes the development of a microsimulation model, MicroEnv, aimed at quantifying the impact of environmental exposures on health as an aid to selecting policies likely to have greatest benefit. Its methods allow the integration of morbidity and mortality outcomes and the generation of results at high spatial resolution. We illustrate its application to the assessment of the impact of air pollution on health in London. Simulations are performed at Lower Layer Super Output Area (LSOA), the smallest geographic unit (population of around 1500 inhabitants) for which detailed socio-demographic data are routinely available in the UK. The health of each individual in these LSOAs is simulated year-by-year using a health-state-transition model, where transition probabilities from one state to another are based on published statistics modified by relative risks that reflect the effect of environmental exposures. This is done through linkage of the simulated population in each LSOA with 1 \u00d7 1 km annual average PM2.5 concentrations and area-based deprivation indices. Air pollution is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity globally, and improving air quality is critical to the SDGs for Health (Goal 3) and Cities (Goal 11). The evidence of MicroEnv is aimed at providing better understanding of the benefits for population health and health inequalities of policy actions that affect exposure such as air quality, and thus to help shape policy decisions. Future work will extend the model to integrate other environmental determinants of health.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Air pollution", "Deprivation", "Environmental risks", "Health modelling", "Microsimulation", "SDGs"], "IndexKeywords": ["Deprivation", "Environmental determinants", "Environmental risks", "Environmental sustainability", "Microsimulation", "Microsimulation modeling", "SDGs", "Transition probabilities", "Air Pollution", "Computer Simulation", "Environmental Exposure", "Environmental Policy", "Health Status Disparities", "Humans", "London", "Particulate Matter", "Population Health"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071636750", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Waste Management and Disposal", "ENVI", "2311"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"]], "AuthorData": {"56844908400": {"Name": "Symonds P.", "AuthorID": "56844908400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Environmental Design and Engineering, UCL"}, "7405402740": {"Name": "Taylor J.", "AuthorID": "7405402740", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Environmental Design and Engineering, UCL"}, "6701780461": {"Name": "Chalabi Z.", "AuthorID": "6701780461", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57202098246": {"Name": "Davies M.", "AuthorID": "57202098246", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Environmental Design and Engineering, UCL"}, "7201434649": {"Name": "Wilkinson P.", "AuthorID": "7201434649", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Environmental Design and Engineering, UCL"}, "7004386185": {"Name": "Hutchinson E.", "AuthorID": "7004386185", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57210828767": {"Name": "Ibbetson A.", "AuthorID": "57210828767", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "14421319200": {"Name": "Milner J.", "AuthorID": "14421319200", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}}}
