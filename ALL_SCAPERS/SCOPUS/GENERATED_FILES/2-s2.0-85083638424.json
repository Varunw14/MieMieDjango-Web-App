The chapter discusses the contexts of the pilot institutions and the way these affected the planning, execution and results of the pilots at project and institutional levels, the development of the communication protocols, the development of contingency plans based on risk assessments, and the reporting procedures. The chapter also presents an outline of the success of the pilots in capturing data for use by the instrument developers as well as for the development of pedagogic approaches to the integration of TeSLA instruments in course assessment and the use of TeSLA with SEND students. Advice for future TeSLA users is presented, as well as lessons learned from the piloting process.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Assessment activities", "Case studies", "TeSLA instruments", "TeSLA integration"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083638424", "SubjectAreas": [["Media Technology", "ENGI", "2214"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"]], "AuthorData": {"55203587600": {"Name": "Peytcheva-Forsyth R.", "AuthorID": "55203587600", "AffiliationID": "60019878", "AffiliationName": "Sofia University"}, "6507124003": {"Name": "Mellar H.", "AuthorID": "6507124003", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}}}
