The quality of reporting during the period 2014\u20132015 was compared with the quality of reporting during 1985\u20132006. Methods: This systematic review compared the scientific quality of RCTs in paediatric dentistry published in five paediatric dentistry journals during the defined periods. The Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist of 2010 was used to evaluate the quality of reporting. The inter-reviewers\u2019 agreement was assessed by calculating the kappa score, and disagreements between reviewers were resolved by consequent discussion. The p values and percentages were used to test for significant differences between the two reviews (1985\u20132006 and 2014\u20132015). Results: A total of 40 articles were included. Although the quality of reporting showed considerable heterogeneity, the overall quality of reporting by RCTs was satisfactory and had improved over the years. Conclusions: Using CONSORT checklist, this study showed general improvement in the quality of reporting of RCTs published in pediatric dentistry journals in all article's sections.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Paediatric dentistry", "Published articles", "RCTs", "Reporting", "Scientific quality"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079418779", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57210897604": {"Name": "Alnamankany A.", "AuthorID": "57210897604", "AffiliationID": "60008920", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Dentistry Department, College of Dentistry, Taibah University"}, "7006826945": {"Name": "Ashley P.", "AuthorID": "7006826945", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013985", "AffiliationName": "University College London-Eastman Dental Institute"}}}
