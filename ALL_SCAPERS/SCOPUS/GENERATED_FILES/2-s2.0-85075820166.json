The effect of the number of branching generations N on the thickness of the gas diffusion layer (GDL) and fuel cell performance is determined. Introduction of a fractal flow-field to homogenize reactant concentration at the flow-field | GDL interface allows for the use of thinner GDLs. The model is coupled with an optimized cathode catalyst layer microstructure with respect to platinum utilization and power density, revealing that the 2020 DoE target of ~8 kW/gPt is met at N = 4 generations, and a platinum utilization of ~36 kW/gPt is achieved at N = 6 generations. In terms of the overall fuel cell stack architecture, our results indicate that either the platinum loading or the number of cells in the stack can be reduced by ~75%, the latter option of which, when combined with a 100 \u00b5m GDL, can lead to >80% increase in the volumetric power density of the fuel cell stack.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Flow-field", "Fractal", "Gas diffusion layer", "Lung-inspired", "Pt utilization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cathode catalyst layers", "Fuel cell performance", "Gas diffusion layers", "Lung-inspired", "Platinum utilization", "Pt utilization", "Reactant concentrations", "Volumetric power density"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075820166", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"57200341790": {"Name": "Cho J.I.S.", "AuthorID": "57200341790", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "22954519900": {"Name": "Trogadas P.", "AuthorID": "22954519900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "54790515100": {"Name": "Coppens M.O.", "AuthorID": "54790515100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EPSRC \u201cFrontier Engineering\u201d Centre for Nature Inspired Engineering & Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "54962772600": {"Name": "Neville T.P.", "AuthorID": "54962772600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.J.L.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "55006649900": {"Name": "Marquis J.", "AuthorID": "55006649900", "AffiliationID": "60025534", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"}}}
