This data article is related to the research articles \u201cRadiological Impacts in Life Cycle Assessment. Part I: General framework and two practical methodologies\u201d [1] and \u201cRadiological Impacts in Life Cycle Assessment. Part II: Comparison of Methodologies\u201d [2], which introduced two practical methodologies for assessing the radiological impacts in LCA; these are UCrad and the Critical Group Methodology (CGM). This article reports the characterisation factors, for routine direct discharges and releases from nuclear waste disposed in a geological disposal facility, obtained from both methodologies. The article also reports the underlying data supporting the methodologies and the analysis carried out in the related research articles.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Characterisation factors", "Ionising radiations", "Life cycle assessment", "Nuclear waste", "Radiological impacts", "Radionuclides", "Risk assessment"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085192670", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57203864325": {"Name": "Paulillo A.", "AuthorID": "57203864325", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "35572355100": {"Name": "Lettieri P.", "AuthorID": "35572355100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7101769541": {"Name": "Clift R.", "AuthorID": "7101769541", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Environment and Sustainability, University of Surrey"}, "55844343600": {"Name": "Dodds J.", "AuthorID": "55844343600", "AffiliationID": "60100032", "AffiliationName": "National Nuclear Laboratory"}, "57203860720": {"Name": "Palethorpe S.", "AuthorID": "57203860720", "AffiliationID": "60100032", "AffiliationName": "National Nuclear Laboratory"}, "57208968596": {"Name": "Milliken A.", "AuthorID": "57208968596", "AffiliationID": "123503309", "AffiliationName": "Ardskell"}}}
