It has recently been suggested that the analysis of abilities gained or lost applied to functional scales better reflects meaningful changes. We defined as \u201cgain\u201d a positive change between scores from 0 to either 1 or 2 and as \u201closs\u201d a negative change from either 2 or 1 to 0. The aim of this study was to describe, over 12 months, which abilities on the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) were more frequently lost or gained in patients with SMA II. The cohort included 614 12-month assessments from 243 patients (age range: 30 months - 63 years; mean 9.94, SD \u00b17.91). The peak of abilities gained occurred before the age of 5 years while the highest number of lost abilities was found in the group 5\u201313 years. A correlation between the HFMSE baseline score and the ordinal number of the items was found for both lost (p<0.001) or gained (p<0.001) activities. No correlation was found with SMN2 copy number. These findings will have implications for clinical trial design and for the interpretation of real-world data using new therapeutic approaches.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hammersmith functional motor scale expanded", "Neuromuscular disorders", "Outcome measures", "Pattern of disease progression", "Shift", "Spinal muscular atrophy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090309678", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"57190172166": {"Name": "Coratti G.", "AuthorID": "57190172166", "AffiliationID": "60073799", "AffiliationName": "Centro Clinico Nemo, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS"}, "56033644800": {"Name": "Lucibello S.", "AuthorID": "56033644800", "AffiliationID": "60073799", "AffiliationName": "Centro Clinico Nemo, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS"}, "55177172900": {"Name": "Pera M.C.", "AuthorID": "55177172900", "AffiliationID": "60073799", "AffiliationName": "Centro Clinico Nemo, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS"}, "57211220608": {"Name": "Mercuri E.", "AuthorID": "57211220608", "AffiliationID": "60073799", "AffiliationName": "Centro Clinico Nemo, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS"}, "55672039000": {"Name": "Duong T.", "AuthorID": "55672039000", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Stanford University"}, "25936035000": {"Name": "Day J.", "AuthorID": "25936035000", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Stanford University"}, "57194337718": {"Name": "Muni Lofra R.", "AuthorID": "57194337718", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60001239, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "The John Walton Muscular Dystrophy Research Centre, Newcastle University, Integrated Laboratory Medicine Directorate, Institute of Genetic Medicine, Newcastle Upon Tyne NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57193336164": {"Name": "Civitello M.", "AuthorID": "57193336164", "AffiliationID": "60134712, 60026523", "AffiliationName": "Nemours Children's Hospital, University of Central Florida College of Medicine"}, "7006041140": {"Name": "Finkel R.", "AuthorID": "7006041140", "AffiliationID": "60134712, 60026523", "AffiliationName": "Nemours Children's Hospital, University of Central Florida College of Medicine"}, "55198550500": {"Name": "D'Amico A.", "AuthorID": "55198550500", "AffiliationID": "60017905", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Neuromuscular and Neurodegenerative Disorders, Department of Neurosciences, IRCCS Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children's Hospital"}, "6603162273": {"Name": "Goemans N.", "AuthorID": "6603162273", "AffiliationID": "60031069", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child Neurology, University Hospitals Leuven"}, "55786064900": {"Name": "Darras B.T.", "AuthorID": "55786064900", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60030521", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Neurology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "7102981546": {"Name": "Bruno C.", "AuthorID": "7102981546", "AffiliationID": "60016041", "AffiliationName": "Center of Translational and Experimental Myology, IRCCS Istituto Giannina Gaslini"}, "7006496638": {"Name": "Sansone V.A.", "AuthorID": "7006496638", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Neurorehabilitation Unit, University of Milan, The NEMO Clinical Center in Milan"}, "35332635700": {"Name": "Nascimento Osorio A.", "AuthorID": "35332635700", "AffiliationID": "60011805", "AffiliationName": "Neuromuscular Unit, Neuropaediatrics Department, Institut de Recerca Hospital Universitari Sant Joan de Deu"}, "7102038246": {"Name": "Muntoni F.", "AuthorID": "7102038246", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre"}, "34571823000": {"Name": "Montes J.", "AuthorID": "34571823000", "AffiliationID": "60027565", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Rehabilitation and Regenerative Medicine and Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center"}, "36502853800": {"Name": "Sframeli M.", "AuthorID": "36502853800", "AffiliationID": "60011576", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine and Centro Clinico Nemo Sud, University of Messina"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
