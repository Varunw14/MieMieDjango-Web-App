Our contribution aims to shape the evidence body of the known distinctive biomarkers of superagers and their connections with the Brain and Cognitive Reserve and Brain Maintenance concepts. Methods: We performed a systematic literature search in PubMed and ScienceDirect with no limit on publication date for studies that evaluated potential biomarkers in superagers classified by validated neuropsychological tests. Methodological quality was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Results: Twenty-one studies were included, the majority in neuroimaging, followed by histological, genetic, cognition, and a single one on blood plasma analysis. Superagers exhibited specific regions of cortical preservation, rather than global cortical maintenance, standing out the anterior cingulate and hippocampus regions. Both superagers and controls showed similar levels of amyloid deposition. Moreover, the functional oscillation patterns in superagers resembled those described in young adults. Most of the quality assessment for the included studies showed medium risks of bias. Conclusion: This systematic review supports selective cortical preservation in superagers, comprehending regions of the default mode, and salience networks, overlapped by stronger functional connectivity. In this context, the anterior cingulate cortex is highlighted as an imaging and histologic signature of these subjects. Besides, the biomarkers included pointed out that the Brain and Cognitive Reserve and Brain Maintenance concepts are independent and complementary in the superagers\u2019 setting.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomarkers", "Cognition", "Memory", "Neuroimaging", "Superagers"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091686104", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57197831855": {"Name": "de Godoy L.L.", "AuthorID": "57197831855", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Oncology, Hospital das Cl\u00ednicas, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "14627355000": {"Name": "Bisdas S.", "AuthorID": "14627355000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020736", "AffiliationName": "The National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London"}, "55450482200": {"Name": "Studart-Neto A.", "AuthorID": "55450482200", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Oncology, Hospital das Cl\u00ednicas, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "7003850677": {"Name": "Nitrini R.", "AuthorID": "7003850677", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Oncology, Hospital das Cl\u00ednicas, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "55551870300": {"Name": "da Costa Leite C.", "AuthorID": "55551870300", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Oncology, Hospital das Cl\u00ednicas, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "57195954738": {"Name": "Alves C.A.P.F.", "AuthorID": "57195954738", "AffiliationID": "60030118", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neuroradiology, Department of Radiology, The Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia"}, "57211963095": {"Name": "Saavedra J.S.M.", "AuthorID": "57211963095", "AffiliationID": "60030118", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neuroradiology, Department of Radiology, The Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia"}}}
