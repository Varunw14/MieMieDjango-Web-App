Therefore, we tested whether a high-fat diet (HFD), inducing insulin-resistant diabetes and obesity in mice, would increase susceptibility to develop generalized seizures induced by pentylentetrazole (PTZ) kindling. Furthermore, molecular mechanisms linked to glucose brain transport and the effects of the T2DM antidiabetic drug metformin were also studied along with neuropsychiatric comorbidities. To this aim, two sets of experiments were performed in CD1 mice, in which we firstly evaluated the HFD effects on some metabolic and behavioral parameters in order to have a baseline reference for kindling experiments assessed in the second section of our protocol. We detected that HFD predisposes towards seizure development in the PTZ-kindling model and this was linked to a reduction in glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) expression as observed in GLUT-1 deficiency syndrome in humans but accompanied by a compensatory increase in expression of GLUT-3. While we confirmed that HFD induced neuropsychiatric alterations in the treated mice, it did not change the development of kindling comorbidities. Furthermore, we propose that the beneficial effects of metformin we observed towards seizure development are related to a normalization of both GLUT-1 and GLUT-3 expression levels. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that an altered glycometabolic profile could play a pro-epileptic role in human patients. We therefore recommend that MetS or T2DM should be constantly monitored and possibly avoided in patients with epilepsy, since they could further aggravate this latter condition.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Behavioral comorbidities", "Epilepsy", "Glucose transporters", "Metabolic syndrome", "Type 2 diabetes"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089390680", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"57208750679": {"Name": "Nesci V.", "AuthorID": "57208750679", "AffiliationID": "60069616", "AffiliationName": "Science of Health Department, School of Medicine, University \u201cMagna Graecia\u201d of Catanzaro"}, "57200140760": {"Name": "Russo E.", "AuthorID": "57200140760", "AffiliationID": "60069616", "AffiliationName": "C.I.S.-Interdepartmental Services Centre of Veterinary for Human and Animal Health, Magna Graecia University of Catanzaro"}, "37017920500": {"Name": "Arcidiacono B.", "AuthorID": "37017920500", "AffiliationID": "60069616", "AffiliationName": "Science of Health Department, School of Medicine, University \u201cMagna Graecia\u201d of Catanzaro"}, "13806486700": {"Name": "Citraro R.", "AuthorID": "13806486700", "AffiliationID": "60069616", "AffiliationName": "Science of Health Department, School of Medicine, University \u201cMagna Graecia\u201d of Catanzaro"}, "57208759774": {"Name": "Tallarico M.", "AuthorID": "57208759774", "AffiliationID": "60069616", "AffiliationName": "Science of Health Department, School of Medicine, University \u201cMagna Graecia\u201d of Catanzaro"}, "55666144600": {"Name": "Brunetti A.", "AuthorID": "55666144600", "AffiliationID": "60069616", "AffiliationName": "Science of Health Department, School of Medicine, University \u201cMagna Graecia\u201d of Catanzaro"}, "57201386594": {"Name": "De Sarro G.", "AuthorID": "57201386594", "AffiliationID": "60069616", "AffiliationName": "Science of Health Department, School of Medicine, University \u201cMagna Graecia\u201d of Catanzaro"}, "55761723200": {"Name": "Leo A.", "AuthorID": "55761723200", "AffiliationID": "60069616", "AffiliationName": "Science of Health Department, School of Medicine, University \u201cMagna Graecia\u201d of Catanzaro"}, "7006013892": {"Name": "Constanti A.", "AuthorID": "7006013892", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, UCL School of Pharmacy"}}}
