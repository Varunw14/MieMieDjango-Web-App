While inositol pyrophosphates InsP7 and InsP8 are present in different plant species, both the identity of enzymes responsible for InsP7 synthesis and the isomer identity of plant InsP7 remain unknown. This study demonstrates that Arabidopsis ITPK1 and ITPK2 catalyze the phosphorylation of phytic acid (InsP6) to the symmetric InsP7 isomer 5-InsP7 and that the InsP6 kinase activity of ITPK enzymes is evolutionarily conserved from humans to plants. We also show by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance that plant InsP7 is structurally identical to the in vitro InsP6 kinase products of ITPK1 and ITPK2. Our findings lay the biochemical and genetic basis for uncovering physiological processes regulated by 5-InsP7 in plants.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Arabidopsis", "Arabidopsis Proteins", "Enzyme Assays", "Humans", "Inositol Phosphates", "Oryza", "Phosphorylation", "Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)", "Phytic Acid", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073051561", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"]], "AuthorData": {"55853701900": {"Name": "Laha D.", "AuthorID": "55853701900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology (MRC-LMCB), University College London"}, "55068992200": {"Name": "Parvin N.", "AuthorID": "55068992200", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Crop Science and Resource Conservation, Department of Plant Nutrition, Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-University Bonn"}, "12240407900": {"Name": "Schaaf G.", "AuthorID": "12240407900", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Crop Science and Resource Conservation, Department of Plant Nutrition, Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-University Bonn"}, "6701885812": {"Name": "Saiardi A.", "AuthorID": "6701885812", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology (MRC-LMCB), University College London"}, "36999987200": {"Name": "Hofer A.", "AuthorID": "36999987200", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Zurich"}, "36974307300": {"Name": "Giehl R.F.H.", "AuthorID": "36974307300", "AffiliationID": "60072195", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology and Cell Biology, Leibniz-Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research"}, "35566928000": {"Name": "Von Wir\u00e9n N.", "AuthorID": "35566928000", "AffiliationID": "60072195", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology and Cell Biology, Leibniz-Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research"}, "57211226408": {"Name": "Fernandez-Rebollo N.", "AuthorID": "57211226408", "AffiliationID": "60017246", "AffiliationName": "Center for Plant Molecular Biology, Department of Plant Physiology, Eberhard Karls University T\u00fcbingen"}, "10641609900": {"Name": "Jessen H.J.", "AuthorID": "10641609900", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "CIBSS-Centre for Integrative Biological Signalling Studies, University of Freiburg"}}}
