The aim of this work is to use the NIRS cerebral oxygenation data (HbD = oxygenated-haemoglobin \u2013 deoxygenated-haemoglobin) combined with arterial saturation (SaO2) from pulse oximetry to calculate cerebral blood flow (CBF) based on the oxygen swing method, during spontaneous desaturation episodes. The method is based on Fick\u2019s principle and uses HbD as a tracer; when a sudden change in SaO2 occurs, the change in HbD represents a change in tracer concentration, and thus it is possible to estimate CBF. CBF was successfully calculated with broadband NIRS in 11 HIE infants (3 with severe injury) for 70 oxygenation events on the day of birth. The average CBF was 18.0 \u00b1 12.7 ml 100 g\u22121 min\u22121 with a range of 4 ml 100 g\u22121 min\u22121 to 60 ml 100 g\u22121 min\u22121. For infants with severe HIE (as determined by magnetic resonance spectroscopy) CBF was significantly lower (p = 0.038, d = 1.35) than those with moderate HIE on the day of birth.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cerebral blood flow", "Clinical", "Hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy", "Near-infrared spectroscopy", "Neonatal brain injury"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain", "Brain Injuries", "Cerebrovascular Circulation", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Oximetry", "Oxygen", "Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077433069", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"56321585100": {"Name": "Bale G.", "AuthorID": "56321585100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57212867544": {"Name": "Taylor N.", "AuthorID": "57212867544", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57190960983": {"Name": "de Roever I.", "AuthorID": "57190960983", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "6507301690": {"Name": "Tachtsidis I.", "AuthorID": "6507301690", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "21135277300": {"Name": "Mitra S.", "AuthorID": "21135277300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "7102666483": {"Name": "Meek J.", "AuthorID": "7102666483", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "7102941268": {"Name": "Robertson N.", "AuthorID": "7102941268", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "57204613410": {"Name": "Sudakou A.", "AuthorID": "57204613410", "AffiliationID": "60028874, 60014383", "AffiliationName": "Nalecz Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering, Polish Academy of Sciences"}}}
