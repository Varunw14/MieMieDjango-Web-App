The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.In this work, a dynamic model of a twin screw feeder, for continuous tablet manufacturing, has been developed. In particular, a First Order Plus Dead Time (FOPDT) model has been suggested. The delayed dynamics depends on operating conditions, equipment design and physical properties of the bulk solid. Model parameters are estimated by fitting the model to experimental data. Due to the nonlinear input-output relationships and the time delays involved, a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is investigated to maintain an accurate mass flow rate, with the ultimate goal to improve product homogeneity in an inherently complex process. The performance of the designed control system is found to be satisfactory in a wide operating range and its potential use in a continuous manufacturing process is worth being investigated in the future.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dynamic modelling", "Nonlinear model predictive control", "Pharmaceutical", "Screw feeder", "Time-delay systems"], "IndexKeywords": ["Complex Processes", "Continuous manufacturing process", "First-order plus dead-time models", "Nonlinear model predictive control", "Operating condition", "Screw feeders", "Time-delay systems", "Twin screw feeders"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081392255", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"]], "AuthorData": {"57115556200": {"Name": "Bascone D.", "AuthorID": "57115556200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "57209803372": {"Name": "Shah N.", "AuthorID": "57209803372", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "25029440500": {"Name": "Galvanin F.", "AuthorID": "25029440500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "8687832700": {"Name": "Garcia-Munoz S.", "AuthorID": "8687832700", "AffiliationID": "60025685", "AffiliationName": "Eli Lilly and Company, Lilly Research Laboratories"}}}
