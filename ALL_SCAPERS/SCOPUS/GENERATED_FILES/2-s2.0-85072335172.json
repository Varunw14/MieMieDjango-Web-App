We aimed to study associations between serum NfL (sNfL) concentrations at different time points after ischemic stroke and outcomes. Methods: We prospectively included ischemic stroke cases (n = 595, mean age 59 years, 64% males) and assessed outcomes by both the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and the NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) at 3 months and by mRS at 2 years. In a subsample, long-term (7-year) outcomes were also assessed by both mRS and NIHSS. We used the ultrasensitive single-molecule array assay to measure sNfL in the acute phase (range 1\u201314, median 4 days), after 3 months and 7 years in cases and once in controls (n = 595). Results: Acute-phase sNfL increased by the time to blood-draw and highest concentrations were observed at 3 months post-stroke. High sNfL associated to stroke severity and poor outcomes, and both associations were strongest for 3-month sNfL. After adjusting for age, previous stroke, stroke severity, and day of blood draw, 3-month sNfL was significantly associated to both outcomes at all time points (p < 0.01 throughout). For all main etiological subtypes, both acute phase and 3-month sNfL were significantly higher than in controls, but the dynamics of sNfL differed by stroke subtype. Conclusions: The results from this study inform on sNfL in ischemic stroke and subtypes over time, and show that sNfL predicts short- and long-term neurological and functional outcomes. Our findings suggest a potential utility of sNfL in ischemic stroke outcome prediction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomarkers", "Cerebrovascular disease", "Prognosis", "Stroke in young adults"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Biomarkers", "Brain Ischemia", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neurofilament Proteins", "Recovery of Function", "Stroke"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072335172", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55260697600": {"Name": "Pedersen A.", "AuthorID": "55260697600", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Genetics and Genomics, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "15063344300": {"Name": "Stanne T.M.", "AuthorID": "15063344300", "AffiliationID": "60079626, 60016437, 60027675", "AffiliationName": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, The Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg"}, "35479725000": {"Name": "Nilsson S.", "AuthorID": "35479725000", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematical Statistics, Chalmers University of Technology"}, "57190746324": {"Name": "Klasson S.", "AuthorID": "57190746324", "AffiliationID": "60079626, 60016437, 60027675", "AffiliationName": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, The Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg"}, "57194843302": {"Name": "Jern C.", "AuthorID": "57194843302", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Genetics and Genomics, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "7006378887": {"Name": "Rosengren L.", "AuthorID": "7006378887", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg"}, "37064826200": {"Name": "Holmegaard L.", "AuthorID": "37064826200", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg"}, "7801500835": {"Name": "Jood K.", "AuthorID": "7801500835", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg"}, "7101909602": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "7101909602", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "57208899083": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "57208899083", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL"}}}
