The focus of the present study was to evaluate short- and long-term cognitive effects of bilateral cZi DBS in patients with PD. METHODS Twenty-five nondemented patients with advanced PD were recruited to participate in a randomized trial of cZi DBS versus best medical treatment (BMT). The patients in the BMT group were offered surgery after 6 months. Neuropsychological evaluations focusing on assessing verbal and visuospatial memory, attention, and executive function were conducted at baseline and at 6 and 24 months after surgery. Self-reported measures of depression, anxiety, and change in \u201cfrontal\u201d behaviors were also completed at all assessment points. RESULTS Bilateral cZi DBS in patients with PD generated few adverse cognitive effects. At the short-term follow-up after 6 months, no differences were found between patients randomized to BMT and patients randomized to DBS with regard to most of the cognitive domains assessed. A transient improvement in anxiety was, however, found in the surgical group. At the long-term follow-up 24 months after cZi DBS, no major changes in global cognitive functioning were found, although a decline in attention and self-reported executive function was noted. CONCLUSIONS With the exception of a decline in attention and self-reported executive function, bilateral cZi DBS for PD in appropriately screened patients appears to be generally safe with regard to cognitive function, both in the short- and long-term perspective.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cognition", "Deep brain stimulation", "Functional neurosurgery", "Neuropsychology", "Parkinson\u2019s disease", "Zona incerta"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85100240654", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57221310876": {"Name": "Philipson J.", "AuthorID": "57221310876", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Neuroscience, Ume\u00e5 University"}, "55928136000": {"Name": "Blomstedt P.", "AuthorID": "55928136000", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Neuroscience, Ume\u00e5 University"}, "54580894800": {"Name": "Fredricks A.", "AuthorID": "54580894800", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Neuroscience, Ume\u00e5 University"}, "7005641179": {"Name": "Hariz M.", "AuthorID": "7005641179", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Functional Neurosurgery, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57205027212": {"Name": "Persson R.S.", "AuthorID": "57205027212", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Neuroscience, Ume\u00e5 University"}, "57221302904": {"Name": "Jahanshahi M.", "AuthorID": "57221302904", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Hospital of Chengdu Brain Science Institute, MOE Key Lab for Neuroinformation, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}}}
