Here, we assess whether acute (75 \u03bcM ouabain 100 nM blebbistatin) or chronic myocardial Nai load (PLM3SA mouse) are causally linked to metabolic remodelling and whether the failing heart shares a common Na-mediated metabolic \u2018fingerprint\u2019. Control (PLMWT), transgenic (PLM3SA), ouabain-treated and hypertrophied Langendorff-perfused mouse hearts are studied by 23Na, 31P, 13C NMR followed by 1H-NMR metabolomic profiling. Elevated Nai leads to common adaptive metabolic alterations preceding energetic impairment: a switch from fatty acid to carbohydrate metabolism and changes in steady-state metabolite concentrations (glycolytic, anaplerotic, Krebs cycle intermediates). Inhibition of mitochondrial Na/Ca exchanger by CGP37157 ameliorates the metabolic changes. In silico modelling indicates altered metabolic fluxes (Krebs cycle, fatty acid, carbohydrate, amino acid metabolism). Prevention of Nai overload or inhibition of Na/Camito may be a new approach to ameliorate metabolic dysregulation in heart failure.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cellular Reprogramming", "Cytoplasm", "Disease Models, Animal", "Energy Metabolism", "Gene Knock-In Techniques", "Heart", "Heart Failure", "Hypertrophy", "Isolated Heart Preparation", "Male", "Metabolic Diseases", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Mitochondria", "Myocardium", "Rats", "Rats, Wistar", "Sodium", "Sodium-Calcium Exchanger", "Thiazepines"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089958042", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"26021747000": {"Name": "Aksentijevi\u0107 D.", "AuthorID": "26021747000", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, Charterhouse Square"}, "55233650800": {"Name": "Basalay M.V.", "AuthorID": "55233650800", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60011520, 60100024", "AffiliationName": "School of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, British Heart Foundation Centre of Research Excellence, King\u2019s College London, The Rayne Institute, St Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "57218668286": {"Name": "Sanchez-Tatay D.", "AuthorID": "57218668286", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60011520, 60100024", "AffiliationName": "School of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, British Heart Foundation Centre of Research Excellence, King\u2019s College London, The Rayne Institute, St Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "57220226682": {"Name": "Eminaga S.", "AuthorID": "57220226682", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60011520, 60100024", "AffiliationName": "School of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, British Heart Foundation Centre of Research Excellence, King\u2019s College London, The Rayne Institute, St Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "7007067275": {"Name": "Shattock M.J.", "AuthorID": "7007067275", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60011520, 60100024", "AffiliationName": "School of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, British Heart Foundation Centre of Research Excellence, King\u2019s College London, The Rayne Institute, St Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "57190169352": {"Name": "Karlstaedt A.", "AuthorID": "57190169352", "AffiliationID": "60027512, 60021568", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Cardiology, McGovern Medical School The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"}, "57197791014": {"Name": "Taegtmeyer H.", "AuthorID": "57197791014", "AffiliationID": "60027512, 60021568", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Cardiology, McGovern Medical School The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"}, "57189063544": {"Name": "O\u2019Brien B.A.", "AuthorID": "57189063544", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King\u2019s College London, St Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "6602574127": {"Name": "Eykyn T.R.", "AuthorID": "6602574127", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King\u2019s College London, St Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "57201575884": {"Name": "Thakker A.", "AuthorID": "57201575884", "AffiliationID": "60033481", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research, College of Medical and Dental Sciences University of Birmingham"}, "16246478100": {"Name": "Tennant D.A.", "AuthorID": "16246478100", "AffiliationID": "60033481", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research, College of Medical and Dental Sciences University of Birmingham"}, "7101951415": {"Name": "Fuller W.", "AuthorID": "7101951415", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow"}}}
