However, applications to low-conductivity specimens - most notably for biomedical imaging - require sensitivity, stability, and tunability only speculated thus far. Here, we demonstrate contactless and noninvasive imaging down to 50 S m-1 using a 50 fT/ Hz 87Rb radio frequency atomic magnetometer operating in an unshielded environment and near room temperature. Two-dimensional images of test objects are obtained with a near-resonant imaging approach, which reduces the phase noise by a factor 172, with a projected sensitivity of 1 S m-1. Our results, an improvement of more than three orders of magnitude on previous imaging demonstrations, push electromagnetic imaging with atomic magnetometers to regions of interest for semiconductors, insulators, and biological tissues.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Atomic magnetometers", "Electromagnetic imaging", "Material characterizations", "Near room temperature", "Non-invasive imaging", "Three orders of magnitude", "Two dimensional images", "Unshielded environment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071271735", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"23477770400": {"Name": "Marmugi L.", "AuthorID": "23477770400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57117691900": {"Name": "Deans C.", "AuthorID": "57117691900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "6603770390": {"Name": "Renzoni F.", "AuthorID": "6603770390", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
