The superlattices are found to have two inequivalent interfaces resulting from differences in the growth modes for PbTiO3 and SrRuO3. X-ray diffraction measurements show that, despite being sandwiched between metallic SrRuO3 layers, the ferroelectric layers possess dense nanoscale domains. The observed domain sizes are comparable to those found in ferroelectric-dielectric systems, and they are attributed to the depolarizing field caused by the finite screening length of the SrRuO3-PbTiO3 interface. The macroscopic capacitance of the ultrathin PbTiO3 layers was measured, and its temperature dependence was found to be consistent with permittivity enhancement due to domain wall motion.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Ferroelectric superlattice", "Impedance spectroscopy", "Permittivity enhancements", "Piezoresponse force microscopy", "Scanning transmission electron microscopy", "Temperature dependence", "Transport measurements", "X-ray diffraction measurements"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092704673", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"57189890679": {"Name": "Hadjimichael M.", "AuthorID": "57189890679", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology and Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57219443573": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "57219443573", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology and Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "9036176900": {"Name": "Zubko P.", "AuthorID": "9036176900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology and Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57220292022": {"Name": "Yedra L.", "AuthorID": "57220292022", "AffiliationID": "60106017, 60106045", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire M\u00e9canique des Sols, Structures et Mat\u00e9riaux, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay"}, "6602545809": {"Name": "Dkhil B.", "AuthorID": "6602545809", "AffiliationID": "60106017, 60106044", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire Structures, Propri\u00e9t\u00e9s et Mod\u00e9lisation des Solides, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay"}}}
