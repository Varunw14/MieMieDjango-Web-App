I argue that the answer to this question can be found in the extent to which individuals are apparently consistent with the prototypical individual in their group. I develop a concept of racial distance, which improves upon the in-group out-group focus of the race and ethnic politics literature. Empirically, I investigate this relationship in South Africa using an original panel survey, which brackets the 2014 national elections. I find that those who are not readily identified as members of their group are less likely to vote with their group and more likely to change their vote due to an election campaign. Analyzing data from the South Africa 2016 the US 2012 elections suggests that this relationship holds for racial majorities but only minorities with a relatively weak sense of solidarity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["identity construction", "race", "racial distance", "South Africa", "voter behavior"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085892696", "SubjectAreas": [["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"56003292300": {"Name": "Harris A.S.", "AuthorID": "56003292300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
