We situate interviews with 25 lawyers, associates and partners, working in onshored UK law firm offices in work on legal services globalisation and the sociology of \u2018dirty work\u2019 (tasks and occupations likely to be perceived as disgusting or degrading). In the context of onshoring, globalisation has led to sidelining in that onshoring allows entry to elite, global firms both for those (the graduates of \u2018good-enough\u2019 law schools) perhaps unable to \u2018make it\u2019 in London and for those law firm partners and associates who have tasted City life and rejected it. That entry is, however, imperfect. It is the \u2018dirty [legal] work\u2019 that is done outside of London: seen as both lesser and also necessary to the law firm\u2019s profitability. We see onshoring as a relatively simple organisational change to the shape of the profession, and also as part of a radical reorientation of a division of labour and what it means to be a professional.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dirty work", "globalisation", "legal profession", "onshoring", "Professional identity formation", "sidelining"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075392198", "SubjectAreas": [["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"57211923034": {"Name": "Carroll E.", "AuthorID": "57211923034", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Senior Lecturer, University of Birmingham"}, "24345563600": {"Name": "Vaughan S.", "AuthorID": "24345563600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Professor of Law and Professional Ethics, UCL"}}}
