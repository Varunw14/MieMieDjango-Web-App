It examines indicators across five broad domains: climate change impacts, exposures and vulnerability; adaptation, planning and resilience for health; mitigation actions and health co-benefits; economics and finance; and public and political engagement. In the wake of the unprecedented and catastrophic 2019\u201320 Australian bushfire season, in this special report we present the 2020 update, with a focus on the relationship between health, climate change and bushfires, highlighting indicators that explore these linkages. In an environment of continuing increases in summer maximum temperatures and heatwave intensity, substantial increases in both fire risk and population exposure to bushfires are having an impact on Australia\u2019s health and economy. As a result of the \u201cBlack Summer\u201d bushfires, the monthly airborne particulate matter less than 2.5 \u03bcm in diameter (PM2.5) concentrations in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory in December 2019 were the highest of any month in any state or territory over the period 2000\u20132019 at 26.0 \u03bcg/m3 and 71.6 \u03bcg/m3 respectively, and insured economic losses were $2.2 billion. We also found growing awareness of and engagement with the links between health and climate change, with a 50% increase in scientific publications and a doubling of newspaper articles on the topic in Australia in 2019 compared with 2018. However, despite clear and present need, Australia still lacks a nationwide adaptation plan for health. As Australia recovers from the compounded effects of the bushfires and the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the health profession has a pivotal role to play. It is uniquely suited to integrate the response to these short term threats with the longer term public health implications of climate change, and to argue for the economic recovery from COVID-19 to align with and strengthen Australia\u2019s commitments under the Paris Agreement.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Air pollutants", "Climate change", "COVID-19", "Disasters", "Health communication", "Health financing", "Health policy", "Mental disorders", "Mortality", "Population health", "Risk management"], "IndexKeywords": ["Australia", "Climate Change", "COVID-19", "Environmental Exposure", "Humans", "Pandemics", "Particulate Matter", "Public Health", "SARS-CoV-2", "Wildfires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096998343", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55739776200": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "55739776200", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "University of Sydney"}, "6603587569": {"Name": "Beggs P.J.", "AuthorID": "6603587569", "AffiliationID": "60019544", "AffiliationName": "Macquarie University"}, "57218613574": {"Name": "Trueck S.", "AuthorID": "57218613574", "AffiliationID": "60019544", "AffiliationName": "Macquarie University"}, "34768782000": {"Name": "Linnenluecke M.K.", "AuthorID": "34768782000", "AffiliationID": "60019544", "AffiliationName": "Macquarie University"}, "57202353659": {"Name": "McGushin A.", "AuthorID": "57202353659", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "56027021800": {"Name": "Watts N.", "AuthorID": "56027021800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "6505763105": {"Name": "Bambrick H.", "AuthorID": "6505763105", "AffiliationID": "60011019", "AffiliationName": "Queensland University of Technology"}, "21934126200": {"Name": "Hanigan I.C.", "AuthorID": "21934126200", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "University Centre for Rural Health, University of Sydney"}, "7402037863": {"Name": "Morgan G.G.", "AuthorID": "7402037863", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "University Centre for Rural Health, University of Sydney"}, "9747755400": {"Name": "Berry H.L.", "AuthorID": "9747755400", "AffiliationID": "60088314, 60019544", "AffiliationName": "Australian Institute of Health Innovation, Macquarie University"}, "7101845773": {"Name": "Johnston F.H.", "AuthorID": "7101845773", "AffiliationID": "60027621, 60015356", "AffiliationName": "Menzies Institute for Medical Research, University of Tasmania"}, "57211236569": {"Name": "Capon A.G.", "AuthorID": "57211236569", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Monash Sustainable Development Institute, Monash University"}}}
