In the current work, the role of a key metabolic integrator, coenzyme A (CoA), in redox regulation of growing cells and during spore formation in Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus subtilis is studied. Exposing these growing cells to oxidising agents or carbon deprivation resulted in extensive covalent protein modification by CoA (termed protein CoAlation), through disulphide bond formation between the CoA thiol group and a protein cysteine. Significant protein CoAlation was observed during sporulation of B. megaterium, and increased largely in parallel with loss of metabolism in spores. Mass spectrometric analysis identified four CoAlated proteins in B. subtilis spores as well as one CoAlated protein in growing B. megaterium cells. All five of these proteins have been identified as moderately abundant in spores. Based on these findings and published studies, protein CoAlation might be involved in facilitating establishment of spores' metabolic dormancy, and/or protecting sensitive sulfhydryl groups of spore enzymes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bacillus species", "Bacterial spores", "Coenzyme A", "Oxidative stress", "Protein CoAlation", "Sporulation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85099072547", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"6602909082": {"Name": "Zhyvoloup A.", "AuthorID": "6602909082", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "57202533345": {"Name": "Yu B.Y.K.", "AuthorID": "57202533345", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "57194868635": {"Name": "Bakovi\u0107 J.", "AuthorID": "57194868635", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "57221405172": {"Name": "Davis-Lunn M.", "AuthorID": "57221405172", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "56613463500": {"Name": "Tossounian M.A.", "AuthorID": "56613463500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "57202535561": {"Name": "Thomas N.", "AuthorID": "57202535561", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "55622378600": {"Name": "Tsuchiya Y.", "AuthorID": "55622378600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "7006969346": {"Name": "Gout I.", "AuthorID": "7006969346", "AffiliationID": "60068520, 60011313", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular Biology and Genetics, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine"}, "7801638525": {"Name": "Peak-Chew S.Y.", "AuthorID": "7801638525", "AffiliationID": "60010269", "AffiliationName": "Biological Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics Cell Biology, MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"}, "6506699487": {"Name": "Skehel M.", "AuthorID": "6506699487", "AffiliationID": "60010269", "AffiliationName": "Biological Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics Cell Biology, MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"}, "7103291401": {"Name": "Setlow P.", "AuthorID": "7103291401", "AffiliationID": "60000209", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Biology and Biophysics, UConn Health"}, "57204263627": {"Name": "Wigneshweraraj S.", "AuthorID": "57204263627", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Section of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, MRC Centre for Molecular Bacteriology and Infection, Imperial College London, Flowers Building"}, "7003834287": {"Name": "Filonenko V.", "AuthorID": "7003834287", "AffiliationID": "60068520, 60011313", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular Biology and Genetics, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine"}}}
