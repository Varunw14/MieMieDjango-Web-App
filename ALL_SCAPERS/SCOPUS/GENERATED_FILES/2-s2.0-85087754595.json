In this paper, a comprehensive error analysis and scalability study of the GPU version of the code is presented. A novel decomposition of the numerical errors into the dispersion and dissipation components is explored. Most tsunami codes exhibit amplitude smearing and/or phase lagging/leading, so the decomposition shown here is a new approach and novel tool for explaining these occurrences. To date, Volna-OP2 has been widely used by the tsunami modelling community. In particular its computational efficiency has allowed various sensitivity analyses and uncertainty quantification studies. Due to the number of simulations required, there is always a trade-off between accuracy and runtime when carrying out these statistical studies. The analysis presented in this paper will guide the user towards an acceptable level of accuracy within a given runtime.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Error analysis", "Finite-volume scheme", "GPUs", "Tsunami modelling"], "IndexKeywords": ["High performance computing (HPC)", "Massively parallels", "New approaches", "Numerical errors", "Performance analysis", "Statistical study", "Trade off", "Uncertainty quantifications"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087754595", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"57204718716": {"Name": "Giles D.", "AuthorID": "57204718716", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics and Statistics, University College Dublin"}, "6603251943": {"Name": "Kashdan E.", "AuthorID": "6603251943", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics and Statistics, University College Dublin"}, "57220616310": {"Name": "Dias F.", "AuthorID": "57220616310", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "Earth Institute, University College Dublin"}, "56912285400": {"Name": "Salmanidou D.M.", "AuthorID": "56912285400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "6602921518": {"Name": "Guillas S.", "AuthorID": "6602921518", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}}}
