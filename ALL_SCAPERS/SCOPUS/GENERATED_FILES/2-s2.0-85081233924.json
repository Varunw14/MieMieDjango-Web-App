Nanotubes were modelled as the hard-core ellipsoids of revolution with high aspect ratio. The evident anisotropy was observed in the percolation threshold and conductivity. The minimal mean values of the percolation of 4.6 vol. % and maximal conductivity of 0.74 S/m were found for the isotropic composite. Being slightly aligned, the composite demonstrates lower percolation concentration and conductivity along the orientation of the nanotubes compared to the perpendicular arrangement.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carbon nanotubes composite", "Conductivity", "Monte Carlo simulations", "Percolation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081233924", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Process Chemistry and Technology", "CENG", "1508"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes", "CENG", "1507"]], "AuthorData": {"55198873500": {"Name": "Plyushch A.", "AuthorID": "55198873500", "AffiliationID": "60061193, 60046660", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Nuclear Problems, Belarusian State University"}, "55865561500": {"Name": "\u0160imenas M.", "AuthorID": "55865561500", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Vilnius University"}, "6506183222": {"Name": "Macutkevi\u010d J.", "AuthorID": "6506183222", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Vilnius University"}, "7003687871": {"Name": "Banys J.", "AuthorID": "7003687871", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Vilnius University"}, "25627416400": {"Name": "Bychanok D.", "AuthorID": "25627416400", "AffiliationID": "60061193, 60046660", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Nuclear Problems, Belarusian State University"}, "57200289247": {"Name": "Kuzhir P.", "AuthorID": "57200289247", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Photonics, University of Eastern Finland"}, "55488887400": {"Name": "Lyakhov D.", "AuthorID": "55488887400", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "Computer, Electrical and Mathematical Science and Engineering Division, 4700 King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"}, "55803668500": {"Name": "Michels D.", "AuthorID": "55803668500", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "Computer, Electrical and Mathematical Science and Engineering Division, 4700 King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"}, "24773773600": {"Name": "Lamberti P.", "AuthorID": "24773773600", "AffiliationID": "60007061", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information and Electrical Engineering and Applied Mathematics, University of Salerno"}}}
