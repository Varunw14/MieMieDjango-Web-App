Considerable research has been performed during this time regarding optimum patient preparation, choice of enteric contrast medium, and MR imaging sequence protocol but findings have not been universally implemented. However, evidence-based consensus statements have recently been published from the United States and Europe. This article summarizes key findings from this guidance and presents practice examples from the authors\u2019 own institution.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Enterography", "Guideline", "MR imaging", "Preparation", "Protocol", "Small bowel", "Technique"], "IndexKeywords": ["Contrast Media", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Humans", "Image Enhancement", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Intestinal Diseases", "Intestine, Small", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074496173", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"7103409605": {"Name": "Boone D.", "AuthorID": "7103409605", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Specialist Imaging, University College London Hospital"}, "57203543924": {"Name": "Taylor S.A.", "AuthorID": "57203543924", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}}}
