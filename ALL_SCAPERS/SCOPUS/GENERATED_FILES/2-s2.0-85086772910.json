Yet, its function during embryonic development is poorly understood. The zebrafish APP orthologue, Appb, is strongly expressed during early development but thus far has only been studied via morpholino-mediated knockdown. Zebrafish enables analysis of cellular processes in an ontogenic context, which is limited in many other vertebrates. We characterized zebrafish carrying a homozygous mutation that introduces a premature stop in exon 2 of the appb gene. We report that appb mutants are significantly smaller until 2 dpf and display perturbed enveloping layer (EVL) integrity and cell protrusions at the blastula stage. Moreover, appb mutants surviving beyond 48 hpf exhibited no behavioral defects at 6 dpf and developed into healthy and fertile adults. The expression of the app family member, appa, was also found to be altered in appb mutants. Taken together, we show that appb is involved in the initial development of zebrafish by supporting the integrity of the EVL, likely by mediating cell adhesion properties. The loss of Appb might then be compensated for by other app family members to maintain normal development.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor", "Animals", "Cell Adhesion", "Cells, Cultured", "Embryo Culture Techniques", "Embryo, Nonmammalian", "Embryonic Development", "Exons", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Mutation", "Zebrafish"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086772910", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55347259200": {"Name": "Banote R.K.", "AuthorID": "55347259200", "AffiliationID": "124622373", "AffiliationName": "Cellectricon AB, Neongatan 4B, SE-431 53"}, "56816693600": {"Name": "Chebli J.", "AuthorID": "56816693600", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, The Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "57190173628": {"Name": "\u015eat\u0131r T.M.", "AuthorID": "57190173628", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, The Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "6603188649": {"Name": "Abramsson A.", "AuthorID": "6603188649", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, The Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "57208899083": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "57208899083", "AffiliationID": "100569211", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute"}, "6701397694": {"Name": "Varshney G.K.", "AuthorID": "6701397694", "AffiliationID": "60030288", "AffiliationName": "Genes & Human Disease Program, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation"}, "6506882138": {"Name": "Ledin J.", "AuthorID": "6506882138", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Organismal Biology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University"}, "7101644458": {"Name": "Burgess S.M.", "AuthorID": "7101644458", "AffiliationID": "60013369, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Translational and Functional Genomics Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health"}, "35727497200": {"Name": "Camacho R.", "AuthorID": "35727497200", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cellular Imaging, Core Facilities, The Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}}}
