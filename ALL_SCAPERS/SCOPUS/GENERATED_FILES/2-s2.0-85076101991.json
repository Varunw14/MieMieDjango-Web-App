Liver International published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Background & Aims: The loss-of-function rs72613567 T > TA-variant in the 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 13 (HSD17B13) gene might protect from alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (ALD/NAFLD) and associated fibrosis/cirrhosis. We investigated the impact of the T > TA-variant on hepatic decompensation and mortality and investigated its implications on retinol and sex steroid metabolism in patients who had already developed advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD). Methods: Retrospective analysis in prospectively characterized patients with viral hepatitis- and ALD/NAFLD-induced portal hypertension (hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) \u2265 6 mmHg) diagnosed at the Medical University of Vienna. Results: Among 487 patients who were followed longitudinally, 166 (34%) were heterozygous and 24 (5%) were homozygous for the \u2018protective\u2019 TA-allele. Patients harbouring at least one TA-allele had a lower MELD (9 (8-12) vs 10 (8-13) points; P =.003) and showed a trend towards lower HVPG (16 \u00b1 6 vs 17 \u00b1 7 mmHg; P =.067). Interestingly, in competing risk analyses adjusted for age, HVPG and MELD, harbouring the TA-allele was associated with numerically increased risks for mortality (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio (aSHR): 1.3 (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.888-1.91); P =.18), liver-related death (aSHR: 1.34 (95% CI: 0.9-1.98); P =.15) and hepatic decompensation (aSHR: 1.29 (95% CI: 0.945-1.77); P =.11). This might be explained by trends towards worse outcomes (eg liver-related death: aSHR: 1.64 (95% CI: 0.95-2.84); P =.076) in patients with viral hepatitis-induced ACLD. In a cross-sectional analysis of 211 additional patients, serum retinol levels were comparable between HSD17B13 genotypes, but in males, serum testosterone levels numerically decreased with an increasing number of TA-alleles. Conclusion: In patients with viral hepatitis- and ALD-induced portal hypertension, the T > TA-variant was not protective of hepatic decompensation and mortality. Further studies should investigate the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the effects of HSD17B13 genotype at different stages of liver disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["alcoholic liver disease", "cirrhosis", "non-alcoholic fatty liver disease", "viral hepatitis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076101991", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"]], "AuthorData": {"55803009600": {"Name": "Scheiner B.", "AuthorID": "55803009600", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Lab, Medical University of Vienna"}, "36769160400": {"Name": "St\u00e4ttermayer A.F.", "AuthorID": "36769160400", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Lab, Medical University of Vienna"}, "35485391200": {"Name": "Schwabl P.", "AuthorID": "35485391200", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Lab, Medical University of Vienna"}, "56176028800": {"Name": "Bucsics T.", "AuthorID": "56176028800", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Lab, Medical University of Vienna"}, "56521656600": {"Name": "Paternostro R.", "AuthorID": "56521656600", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Lab, Medical University of Vienna"}, "57195487529": {"Name": "Bauer D.", "AuthorID": "57195487529", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Lab, Medical University of Vienna"}, "56658776100": {"Name": "Simbrunner B.", "AuthorID": "56658776100", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Lab, Medical University of Vienna"}, "25226313400": {"Name": "Pinter M.", "AuthorID": "25226313400", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Lab, Medical University of Vienna"}, "7006061605": {"Name": "Trauner M.", "AuthorID": "7006061605", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna"}, "24315181000": {"Name": "Reiberger T.", "AuthorID": "24315181000", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Lab, Medical University of Vienna"}, "7101836598": {"Name": "Ferenci P.", "AuthorID": "7101836598", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna"}, "55369068500": {"Name": "Mandorfer M.", "AuthorID": "55369068500", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Lab, Medical University of Vienna"}, "57188694170": {"Name": "Schmidt R.", "AuthorID": "57188694170", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna"}, "7003758775": {"Name": "Marculescu R.", "AuthorID": "7003758775", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna"}, "6603727095": {"Name": "Ferlitsch A.", "AuthorID": "6603727095", "AffiliationID": "102016156", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine I, Hospital of St. John of God"}, "7004157033": {"Name": "Peck-Radosavljevic M.", "AuthorID": "7004157033", "AffiliationID": "116517752", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Endocrinology, and Nephrology, Klinikum Klagenfurt am Woerthersee"}}}
