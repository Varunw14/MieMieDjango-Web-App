Therefore, the integration of new IoT devices and services requires a self-assessment of IoT cyber security posture. By security posture this article refers to the cybersecurity strength of an organisation to predict, prevent and respond to cyberthreats. At present, there is a gap in the state of the art, because there are no self-assessment methods for quantifying IoT cyber risk posture. To address this gap, an empirical analysis is performed of 12 cyber risk assessment approaches. The results and the main findings from the analysis is presented as the current and a target risk state for IoT systems, followed by conclusions and recommendations on a transformation roadmap, describing how IoT systems can achieve the target state with a new goal-oriented dependency model. By target state, we refer to the cyber security target that matches the generic security requirements of an organisation. The research paper studies and adapts four alternatives for IoT risk assessment and identifies the goal-oriented dependency modelling as a dominant approach among the risk assessment models studied. The new goal-oriented dependency model in this article enables the assessment of uncontrollable risk states in complex IoT systems and can be used for a quantitative self-assessment of IoT cyber risk posture.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cyber risk regulations", "Cyber risk self-assessment", "Cyber risk target state", "Empirical analysis", "Functional dependency", "Goal-oriented approach", "Internet of things", "Micro-mort model", "Network-based linear dependency modelling", "Transformation roadmap"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096373521", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"]], "AuthorData": {"57003734400": {"Name": "Radanliev P.", "AuthorID": "57003734400", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Oxford e-Research Centre, Department of Engineering Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "6701509117": {"Name": "De Roure D.", "AuthorID": "6701509117", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Oxford e-Research Centre, Department of Engineering Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "6507917811": {"Name": "Van Kleek M.", "AuthorID": "6507917811", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Oxford e-Research Centre, Department of Engineering Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "23491291000": {"Name": "Ani U.", "AuthorID": "23491291000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "STEaPP, Faculty of Engineering Science, University College London"}, "8945612500": {"Name": "Burnap P.", "AuthorID": "8945612500", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Computer Science and Informatics, Cardiff University"}, "57197719506": {"Name": "Anthi E.", "AuthorID": "57197719506", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Computer Science and Informatics, Cardiff University"}, "26639650900": {"Name": "Nurse J.R.C.", "AuthorID": "26639650900", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "School of Computing, University of Kent"}, "57218326227": {"Name": "Santos O.", "AuthorID": "57218326227", "AffiliationID": "113845917", "AffiliationName": "Cisco Research Centre"}, "15078590300": {"Name": "Montalvo R.M.", "AuthorID": "15078590300", "AffiliationID": "113845917", "AffiliationName": "Cisco Research Centre"}, "57218330223": {"Name": "Maddox L.T.", "AuthorID": "57218330223", "AffiliationID": "113845917", "AffiliationName": "Cisco Research Centre"}}}
