Despite its potential drawbacks in terms of fitness, the widespread existence of this phenomenon suggests that it should have evolutionary advantages under certain circumstances. Using a global dataset of seed production time series for 219 plant species from all of the continents, we tested whether masting behaviour appears predominantly in species with low foliar nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations when controlling for local climate and productivity. Here, we show that masting intensity is higher in species with low foliar N and P concentrations, and especially in those with imbalanced N/P ratios, and that the evolutionary history of masting behaviour has been linked to that of nutrient economy. Our results support the hypothesis that masting is stronger in species growing under limiting conditions and suggest that this reproductive behaviour might have evolved as an adaptation to nutrient limitations and imbalances.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biological Evolution", "Climate", "Nitrogen", "Nutrients", "Phosphorus", "Seasons", "Seeds"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075953127", "SubjectAreas": [["Plant Science", "AGRI", "1110"]], "AuthorData": {"55241379200": {"Name": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Mart\u00ednez M.", "AuthorID": "55241379200", "AffiliationID": "60023020, 60006754, 60022367", "AffiliationName": "Global Ecology Unit, CREAF\u2013CSIC\u2013UAB"}, "6701746829": {"Name": "Janssens I.A.", "AuthorID": "6701746829", "AffiliationID": "60012937", "AffiliationName": "PLECO (Plants and Ecosystems), Department of Biology, University of Antwerp"}, "6507514478": {"Name": "Sardans J.", "AuthorID": "6507514478", "AffiliationID": "60022367", "AffiliationName": "CREAF"}, "57208381256": {"Name": "Pe\u00f1uelas J.", "AuthorID": "57208381256", "AffiliationID": "60022367", "AffiliationName": "CREAF"}, "22635307800": {"Name": "Pearse I.", "AuthorID": "22635307800", "AffiliationID": "60032369, 60011347", "AffiliationName": "US Geological Survey, Fort Collins Science Center"}, "6603461933": {"Name": "Espelta J.M.", "AuthorID": "6603461933", "AffiliationID": "60022367", "AffiliationName": "CREAF"}, "57148498300": {"Name": "Sayol F.", "AuthorID": "57148498300", "AffiliationID": "119428191", "AffiliationName": "Gothenburg Global Biodiversity Centre"}, "7202478499": {"Name": "Koenig W.D.", "AuthorID": "7202478499", "AffiliationID": "60011997, 60007776", "AffiliationName": "Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Cornell University"}, "7003771041": {"Name": "LaMontagne J.M.", "AuthorID": "7003771041", "AffiliationID": "60026860", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, DePaul University"}, "55867787900": {"Name": "Bogdziewicz M.", "AuthorID": "55867787900", "AffiliationID": "60014168", "AffiliationName": "Department of Systematic Zoology, Faculty of Biology, Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna\u0144"}, "55315379200": {"Name": "Collalti A.", "AuthorID": "55315379200", "AffiliationID": "60050715", "AffiliationName": "Department of Innovation in Biological, Agro-food and Forest Systems, University of Tuscia"}, "56731017900": {"Name": "Hacket-Pain A.", "AuthorID": "56731017900", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography and Planning, School of Environmental Sciences, University of Liverpool"}, "23490821800": {"Name": "Vacchiano G.", "AuthorID": "23490821800", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "DISAA, Universit\u00e0 di Milano"}}}
