A significant proportion of individuals with AN show autistic traits, which may influence social attention. This study examined attention to faces and facial features in AN, recovered AN (REC), and healthy controls, as well as relationships with comorbid psychopathology. One hundred and forty-eight participants\u2019 eye movements were tracked while watching a naturalistic social scene. Anxiety, depression, alexithymia, and autistic traits were assessed via self-report questionnaires. Participants with AN spent significantly less time looking at faces compared to REC and controls; patterns of attention to individual facial features did not differ across groups. Autistic traits mediated the relationship between group and time spent looking at faces.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anorexia nervosa", "Autism spectrum disorder", "Comorbidity", "Eye-tracking", "Social attention"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090794920", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"57188561881": {"Name": "Kerr-Gaffney J.", "AuthorID": "57188561881", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "8384655900": {"Name": "Tchanturia K.", "AuthorID": "8384655900", "AffiliationID": "60104463", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Ilia State University"}, "55783092600": {"Name": "Mason L.", "AuthorID": "55783092600", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Brain & Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "13408335100": {"Name": "Jones E.", "AuthorID": "13408335100", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Brain & Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "55322832100": {"Name": "Hayward H.", "AuthorID": "55322832100", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Forensic & Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "7404062227": {"Name": "Murphy D.", "AuthorID": "7404062227", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Forensic & Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "35179313900": {"Name": "Harrison A.", "AuthorID": "35179313900", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "Psychological Medicine Clinical Academic Group, National Eating Disorders Service, South London and Maudsley NHS Trust"}}}
