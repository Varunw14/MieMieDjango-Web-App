Synthetic control over the solid state properties of organic optoelectronic materials is crucial to access real life applications. Perylene diimides (PDIs) are one of the most highly studied classes of organic fluorescent dyes. In the solid state, \u03c0-\u03c0stacking suppresses their emission, limiting their use in a variety of applications. Here, we report the synthesis of a novel PDI dye that is encapsulated by four alkylene straps. X-ray crystallography indicates that intermolecular \u03c0-\u03c0stacking is completely suppressed in the crystalline state. This is further validated by the photophysical properties of the dye in both solution and solid state and supported by theoretical calculations. However, we find that the introduction of the encapsulating \"arms\" results in the creation of charge-transfer states which modify the excited state properties. This article demonstrates that molecular encapsulation can be used as a powerful tool to tune intermolecular interactions and thereby gain an extra level of control over the solid state properties of organic optoelectronic materials.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Excited-state properties", "Intermolecular interactions", "Optoelectronic properties", "Organic electronic devices", "Organic fluorescent dyes", "Organic optoelectronics", "Photophysical properties", "Theoretical calculations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075476079", "SubjectAreas": [["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"57200617612": {"Name": "Royakkers J.", "AuthorID": "57200617612", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "57193916579": {"Name": "Congrave D.G.", "AuthorID": "57193916579", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "56417050900": {"Name": "Zeng W.", "AuthorID": "56417050900", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "7202183939": {"Name": "Bond A.D.", "AuthorID": "7202183939", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "24477074800": {"Name": "Bronstein H.", "AuthorID": "24477074800", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "55840747800": {"Name": "Minotto A.", "AuthorID": "55840747800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy and LCN, University College London"}, "57211945433": {"Name": "Patel A.", "AuthorID": "57211945433", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy and LCN, University College London"}, "7006071546": {"Name": "Cacialli F.", "AuthorID": "7006071546", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy and LCN, University College London"}, "14420961100": {"Name": "Bu\u010dar D.K.", "AuthorID": "14420961100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
