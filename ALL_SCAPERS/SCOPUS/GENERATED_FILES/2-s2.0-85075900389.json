Here, a new family of isosorbide-derived biomonomers were synthesized and experimentally utilized as a matrix of dental sealants to provide physico-mechanical and biological properties comparable to those of a conventional Bis-GMA-based material but without the the potential estrogenicity. Methods: After synthesis of isosorbide-derived biomonomers (ISDB) by light polymerization, an experimental dental sealant with different silica filler concentrations (0\u201315 wt%) was characterized and compared to a commercially available Bis-GMA-based sealant. Cytotoxicity and estrogenicity assays were conducted with human oral keratinocytes and estrogen-sensitive MCF-7 cells, respectively. Results: ISDB-based dental sealants exhibited typical initially smooth surfaces with depth of cure, Vickers hardness, compressive strength/modulus, water resorption/solubility, and flowability comparable to those of the commercial sealant and met the ISO standard for dental sealants and polymer-based restorative materials. Indirect cytotoxicity tests using an extract showed comparable viability among experimental ISDB-based materials and a commercial Bis-GMA-incorporated control. DNA synthesis in MCF-7 cells (a marker of estrogenicity) and the release of bisphenol A under enzymatic incubation were not detected in ISDB-based materials. Significance: In conclusion, the comparable physico-mechanical properties of ISDB-based materials with their cytocompatibility and lack of estrogenicity suggest the potential usefulness of ISDBs as a newly developed and safe biomaterial.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bisphenol free", "Cytocompatibility", "Estrogenicity", "Experimental biopolymer", "Isosorbide-derived biomonomer"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biological properties", "Bisphenols", "Cytocompatibility", "Estrogenicity", "Glycidyl methacrylate", "Isosorbide", "Physicomechanical properties", "Restorative materials", "Adult", "Biopolymers", "Bisphenol A-Glycidyl Methacrylate", "Child", "Composite Resins", "Humans", "Materials Testing", "Polyethylene Glycols", "Polymerization", "Polymethacrylic Acids"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075900389", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"]], "AuthorData": {"55633679600": {"Name": "Jun S.K.", "AuthorID": "55633679600", "AffiliationID": "60030402", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dental Hygiene, Kyungdong University"}, "57211729840": {"Name": "Kim H.W.", "AuthorID": "57211729840", "AffiliationID": "60002877", "AffiliationName": "UCL Eastman-Korea Dental Medicine Innovation Centre, Dankook University"}, "57202882008": {"Name": "Lee J.H.", "AuthorID": "57202882008", "AffiliationID": "60002877", "AffiliationName": "UCL Eastman-Korea Dental Medicine Innovation Centre, Dankook University"}, "57216969065": {"Name": "Lee H.H.", "AuthorID": "57216969065", "AffiliationID": "60170569, 60002877", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Tissue Regeneration Engineering (ITREN), Dankook University"}, "54411902900": {"Name": "Cha J.R.", "AuthorID": "54411902900", "AffiliationID": "60002877", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nanobiomedical Science & BK21 PLUS NBM Global Research Center for Regenerative Medicine Research Center, Dankook University"}, "26643634100": {"Name": "Knowles J.C.", "AuthorID": "26643634100", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Discoveries Centre for Regenerative and Precision Medicine, Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}}}
