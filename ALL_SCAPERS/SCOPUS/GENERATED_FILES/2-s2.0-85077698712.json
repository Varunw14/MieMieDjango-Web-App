Outcomes have been reported sporadically. No pooled analysis of retrospective series has been performed. Objective: This review and pooled analysis sought to demonstrate objective evidence of improved graft function in lung transplant patients undergoing antireflux surgery (ARS). Methods: In accordance with Meta-analyses of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines, a search of PubMed Central, Medline, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library databases was performed. Articles documenting spirometry data pre- and post-ARS were reviewed and a random-effects model meta-analysis was performed on forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) values and the rate of change of FEV1. Results: Six articles were included in the meta-analysis. Regarding FEV1 before and after ARS, we observed a small increase in FEV1 values in studies reporting raw values (2.02 \u00b1 0.89 L/1 sec vs 2.14 \u00b1 0.77 L/1 sec; n = 154) and % of predicted (77.1% \u00b1 22.1% vs 81.2% \u00b1 26.95%; n = 45), with a small pooled Cohen d effect size of 0.159 (P = .114). When considering the rate of change of FEV1 we observed a significant difference in pre-ARS compared with post-ARS (\u20132.12 \u00b1 2.76 mL/day vs +0.05 \u00b1 1.19 mL/day; n = 103). There was a pooled effect size of 1.702 (P = .013), a large effect of ARS on the rate of change of FEV1 values. Conclusions: This meta-analysis of retrospective observational studies demonstrates that ARS might benefit patients with declining FEV1, by examining the rate of change of FEV1 during the pre- and postoperative periods.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BOS", "bronchiolitis obliterans", "fundoplication", "lung transplant", "meta-analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Allografts", "Bronchiolitis Obliterans", "Fundoplication", "Gastric Acidity Determination", "Gastroesophageal Reflux", "Graft Rejection", "Humans", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration", "Lung Transplantation", "Respiratory Function Tests"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077698712", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"56780896700": {"Name": "Davidson J.R.", "AuthorID": "56780896700", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Surgery, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "7102181886": {"Name": "Eaton S.", "AuthorID": "7102181886", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Section, University College London\u2013Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57203257829": {"Name": "De Coppi P.", "AuthorID": "57203257829", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Surgery, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "57198123285": {"Name": "Curry J.", "AuthorID": "57198123285", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Surgery, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "57213191877": {"Name": "Franklin D.", "AuthorID": "57213191877", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oesophagogastric Surgery, University College London Hospital"}, "56637945600": {"Name": "Mohammadi B.", "AuthorID": "56637945600", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oesophagogastric Surgery, University College London Hospital"}, "6505884598": {"Name": "Dawas K.", "AuthorID": "6505884598", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oesophagogastric Surgery, University College London Hospital"}, "55452774100": {"Name": "Kumar S.", "AuthorID": "55452774100", "AffiliationID": "60027057", "AffiliationName": "Department of Academic Surgery, The Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "34871387200": {"Name": "Abbassi-Ghadi N.", "AuthorID": "34871387200", "AffiliationID": "60028760", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oesophagogastric Surgery, Royal Surrey County Hospital"}}}
