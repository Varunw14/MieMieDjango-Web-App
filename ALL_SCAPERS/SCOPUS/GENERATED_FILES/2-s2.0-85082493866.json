Using an ethnographic approach including interviews, walks, observation and photomap making, this article reports on the findings from a unique pilot study of the social and educational lives of young foster children (aged 0\u20124) in an inner London borough. The following findings are presented: (1) what foster carers do: everyday lives and education; (2) foster carers\u2019 meanings and perspectives on early education; and (3) foster carers as \u2018everyday experts\u2019 in meeting complex needs. The findings demonstrate how foster carers fulfil multifaceted roles as they navigate complex everyday life with their young children. Ways in which foster carers may provide a \u2018stimulating\u2019 environment and the barriers and difficulties they encounter are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["education", "ethnography", "everyday life", "foster care", "foster carers", "Young children"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082493866", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"16550400800": {"Name": "Meetoo V.", "AuthorID": "16550400800", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "7202305746": {"Name": "Cameron C.", "AuthorID": "7202305746", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "36093940000": {"Name": "Clark A.", "AuthorID": "36093940000", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "55419784400": {"Name": "Jackson S.", "AuthorID": "55419784400", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}}}
