This is contextualised to the case of Brazil through a systematic approach applied to the sanitation sector that considers the range of infrastructure, management services and people involved in different phases of the service chain, from municipal wastewater containment to safe disposal or re-use. Articulating the social, economic and environmental dimensions of sanitation, this study analyses their links with each of the 169 SDG targets. We demonstrate that 87 targets across 16 goals require action in Brazil's sanitation sector to achieve the SDGs. Furthermore, we identify synergies between sanitation and 124 targets in four domains: basic services for resilience building, equity and empowerment, pollution reduction and waste reuse and economic well-being. Key results include the need for Brazil to invest in closed-loop systems that valorise waste as a resource and the need to multiply efforts in the integrated provision of basic services in low-income areas most affected by the lack of access to adequate sanitation. The links identified are supported by the compiled evidence of published research. The analysis of linkages through this structured approach aims to highlight opportunities for strategic governance action to support policy harmonisation and partnerships across Brazil's sanitation sector and beyond. With this research, we show that establishing linkages among the SDGs provides an adaptable framework that can support policy-makers and practitioners seeking to deliver on the 2030 Agenda.", "AuthorKeywords": ["2030 agenda", "Brazil", "governance", "inequalities", "partnerships", "policy coherence", "sanitation", "sustainable development goals"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096701720", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Development", "SOCI", "3303"]], "AuthorData": {"57208532630": {"Name": "Diep L.", "AuthorID": "57208532630", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Urban Sustainability and Resilience and Engineering for International Development Centre, Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering Department, University College London"}, "57220714250": {"Name": "Martins F.P.", "AuthorID": "57220714250", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Postgraduate Program in Business Administration, Business Department, School of Economics, Business and Accounting of Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, University Campus"}, "14043273200": {"Name": "Campos L.C.", "AuthorID": "14043273200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Urban Sustainability and Resilience, Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering Department, University College London"}, "35733887700": {"Name": "Hofmann P.", "AuthorID": "35733887700", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett Development Planning Unit, University College London"}, "26636031400": {"Name": "Tomei J.", "AuthorID": "26636031400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources, University College London"}, "6506572494": {"Name": "Lakhanpaul M.", "AuthorID": "6506572494", "AffiliationID": "60162048", "AffiliationName": "Whittington NHS Trust"}, "26031677400": {"Name": "Parikh P.", "AuthorID": "26031677400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Engineering for International Development Centre, Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering Department, University College London"}}}
