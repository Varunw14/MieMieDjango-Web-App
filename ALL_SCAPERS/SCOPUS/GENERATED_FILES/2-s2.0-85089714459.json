The Late Upper Palaeolithic Magdalenian saw a flourishing of such depictions, encompassing cave art, engraving of stone, bone and antler blanks and decoration of tools and weapons. Though Magdalenian settlement exists as far northwest as Britain, there is a limited range of art known from this region, possibly associated with only fleeting occupation of Britain during this period. Stone plaquettes, flat fragments of stone engraved on at least one surface, have been found in large quantities at numerous sites spanning the temporal and geographical spread of the Magdalenian, but they have been absent so far from the archaeological record of the British Isles. Between 2015 and 2018, ten fragments of stone plaquettes extensively engraved with abstract designs were uncovered at the Magdalenian site of Les Varines, Jersey, Channel Islands. In this paper, we report detailed analyses of these finds, which provide new evidence for technologies of abstract mark-making, and their significance within the lives of people on the edge of the Magdalenian world. These engraved stone fragments represent important, rare evidence of artistic expression in what is the far northern and western range of the Magdalenian and add new insight to the wider significance of dynamic practices of artistic expression during the Upper Palaeolithic.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Archaeology", "Art", "Engraving and Engravings", "Islands"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089714459", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"10139236300": {"Name": "Bello S.M.", "AuthorID": "10139236300", "AffiliationID": "60025352", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Natural History Museum"}, "7201400888": {"Name": "Welch M.D.", "AuthorID": "7201400888", "AffiliationID": "60025352", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Natural History Museum"}, "55925138900": {"Name": "Blinkhorn E.", "AuthorID": "55925138900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "55811025000": {"Name": "Pope M.", "AuthorID": "55811025000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "57202976878": {"Name": "Needham A.", "AuthorID": "57202976878", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology, University of York"}, "57117273100": {"Name": "Little A.", "AuthorID": "57117273100", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology, University of York"}, "57213608265": {"Name": "Bates M.", "AuthorID": "57213608265", "AffiliationID": "60105000", "AffiliationName": "School of Environment, Archaeology, History and Anthropology, University of Wales Trinity Saint David"}, "56059925100": {"Name": "Duffy S.", "AuthorID": "56059925100", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology, Classics and Egyptology, University of Liverpool"}, "14044119800": {"Name": "Scott B.", "AuthorID": "14044119800", "AffiliationID": "60003455", "AffiliationName": "British Museum"}, "23028679200": {"Name": "Shaw A.", "AuthorID": "23028679200", "AffiliationID": "60113030", "AffiliationName": "Wessex Archaeology"}, "47361394100": {"Name": "Kinnaird T.", "AuthorID": "47361394100", "AffiliationID": "60022132", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of St Andrews"}, "57218595377": {"Name": "Millar L.", "AuthorID": "57218595377", "AffiliationID": "60022132", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of St Andrews"}, "57218595614": {"Name": "Robinson R.", "AuthorID": "57218595614", "AffiliationID": "60022132", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of St Andrews"}, "6506615781": {"Name": "Conneller C.", "AuthorID": "6506615781", "AffiliationID": "60162625, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "School of History, Classics and Archaeology, Newcastle University"}}}
