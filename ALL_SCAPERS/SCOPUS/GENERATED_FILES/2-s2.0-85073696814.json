Published by BMJ.Global Health has not featured as prominently in the European Union (EU) research agenda in recent years as it did in the first decade of the new millennium, and participation of low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) in EU health research has declined substantially. The Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Framework adopted by the European Parliament in April 2019 for the period 2021-2027 will serve as an important funding instrument for health research, yet the proposed health research budget to be finalised towards the end of 2019 was reduced from 10% in the current framework, Horizon 2020, to 8% in Horizon Europe. Our analysis takes the evolvement of Horizon Europe from the initial framework of June 2018 to the framework agreed on in April 2019 into account. It shows that despite some improvements in terms of Global Health and reference to the Sustainable Development Goals, European industrial competitiveness continues to play a paramount role, with Global Health research needs and relevant health research for LMICs being only partially addressed. We argue that the globally interconnected nature of health and the transdisciplinary nature of health research need to be fully taken into account and acted on in the new European Research and Innovation Framework. A facilitated global research collaboration through Horizon Europe could ensure that Global Health innovations and solutions benefit all parts of the world including EU countries.", "AuthorKeywords": ["diagnostics and tools", "health policy", "health systems", "infectious diseases", "public health"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073696814", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57205203846": {"Name": "Berner-Rodoreda A.", "AuthorID": "57205203846", "AffiliationID": "60016908", "AffiliationName": "Heidelberg Institute of Global Health (HIGH), Heidelberg University"}, "55639458000": {"Name": "Jahn A.", "AuthorID": "55639458000", "AffiliationID": "60016908", "AffiliationName": "Heidelberg Institute of Global Health (HIGH), Heidelberg University"}, "23011726900": {"Name": "B\u00e4rnighausen T.", "AuthorID": "23011726900", "AffiliationID": "60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute (AHRI)"}, "12767500200": {"Name": "Rehfuess E.A.", "AuthorID": "12767500200", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry and Epidemiology, Pettenkofer School of Public Health, LMU M\u00fcnchen"}, "7003935853": {"Name": "Klipstein-Grobusch K.", "AuthorID": "7003935853", "AffiliationID": "60032724, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Julius Global Health, Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University"}, "7004225016": {"Name": "Cobelens F.", "AuthorID": "7004225016", "AffiliationID": "60138854, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health, Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development, Amsterdam University Medical Centers"}, "57200598263": {"Name": "Schultsz C.", "AuthorID": "57200598263", "AffiliationID": "60138854, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health, Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development, Amsterdam University Medical Centers"}, "57217276075": {"Name": "Van Leeuwen R.", "AuthorID": "57217276075", "AffiliationID": "60138854, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health, Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development, Amsterdam University Medical Centers"}, "57203254725": {"Name": "Raviglione M.", "AuthorID": "57203254725", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Global Health Centre, Centre for Multidisciplinary Research in Health Science (MACH), University of Milan"}, "57211374203": {"Name": "Flahaut A.", "AuthorID": "57211374203", "AffiliationID": "60015322, 60004718", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Global Health, University of Geneva"}, "57189522264": {"Name": "Casamitjana N.", "AuthorID": "57189522264", "AffiliationID": "60105961, 60001576", "AffiliationName": "Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal), University of Barcelona"}, "7005155812": {"Name": "Plas\u00e8ncia A.", "AuthorID": "7005155812", "AffiliationID": "60105961, 60001576", "AffiliationName": "Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal), University of Barcelona"}, "56125366600": {"Name": "Fr\u00f6schl G.", "AuthorID": "56125366600", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, LMU M\u00fcnchen"}, "57211376552": {"Name": "Skordis-Worral J.", "AuthorID": "57211376552", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "6602338051": {"Name": "Abubakar I.", "AuthorID": "6602338051", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "57197609986": {"Name": "Ashrafian H.", "AuthorID": "57197609986", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Global Health Innovation, Imperial College London"}, "37261118400": {"Name": "Agardh A.", "AuthorID": "37261118400", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Division of Social Medicine and Global Health, Department of Clinical Sciences, Lund University"}, "7103218043": {"Name": "Visser L.", "AuthorID": "7103218043", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "56253453500": {"Name": "Norton R.", "AuthorID": "56253453500", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60175824", "AffiliationName": "George Institute for Global Health, Nuffield Department of Women's and Reproductive Health, University of Oxford"}, "55189385600": {"Name": "Hagander L.", "AuthorID": "55189385600", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Sciences, Lund University"}}}
