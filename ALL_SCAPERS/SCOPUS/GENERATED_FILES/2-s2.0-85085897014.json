The impairment of autophagic flux by defective lysosomal function has been observed in adipose tissue from obese mice. While the fatty acid translocase CD36 is an important immuno-metabolic receptor, it remains unclear whether preadipocyte CD36 is involved in adipose tissue inflammation and whether CD36 regulates lysosomal function. Methods: Using visceral adipose tissue from obese patients, a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice model, primary mouse preadipocytes and 3T3L1 cells we analyzed whether and how preadipocyte CD36 modulates lysosomal function and adipose tissue inflammation. Findings: CD36 expression in preadipocytes is induced in obese patients and HFD-fed mice, accompanied with the disruption of lysosome function. CD36 knockout protects primary preadipocytes of HFD-fed mice from lysosomal impairment. In vitro, CD36 interacts with Fyn to phosphorylate and activate Inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate receptor 1 (IP3R1), causing excess calcium transport from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to lysosome, which results in lysosomal impairment and inflammation. Moreover, IP3R inhibitor 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2APB) attenuates lysosomal impairment, inflammation and lipid accumulation in CD36-overexpressing preadipocytes. Interpretation: Our data support that the abnormal upregulation of CD36 in preadipocytes may contribute to the development of adipose tissue inflammation. CD36/Fyn/IP3R1-mediated lysosomal calcium overload leads to lysosomal impairment and inflammation in preadipocyte. Thus targeting improving lysosomal calcium homeostasis may represent a novel strategy for treating obesity-induced inflammation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CD36", "Inflammation", "IP3R1", "Lysosomal calcium", "Preadipocytes"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085897014", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"57217642819": {"Name": "Luo X.", "AuthorID": "57217642819", "AffiliationID": "60020870, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Lipid Research, Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology for Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute for Viral Hepatitis, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"}, "57217036944": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "57217036944", "AffiliationID": "60020870, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Lipid Research, Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology for Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute for Viral Hepatitis, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"}, "55479220700": {"Name": "Yang P.", "AuthorID": "55479220700", "AffiliationID": "60020870, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Lipid Research, Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology for Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute for Viral Hepatitis, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"}, "57194704182": {"Name": "Wei L.", "AuthorID": "57194704182", "AffiliationID": "60020870, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Lipid Research, Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology for Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute for Viral Hepatitis, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"}, "57217031575": {"Name": "Yu T.", "AuthorID": "57217031575", "AffiliationID": "60020870, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Lipid Research, Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology for Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute for Viral Hepatitis, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"}, "57217030583": {"Name": "Xia J.", "AuthorID": "57217030583", "AffiliationID": "60020870, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Lipid Research, Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology for Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute for Viral Hepatitis, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"}, "35273166000": {"Name": "Ruan X.Z.", "AuthorID": "35273166000", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "John Moorhead Research Laboratory, Centre for Nephrology, University College London Medical School, Royal Free Campus, University College London"}, "56288590600": {"Name": "Zhao L.", "AuthorID": "56288590600", "AffiliationID": "60020870, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Lipid Research, Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology for Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute for Viral Hepatitis, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"}, "7601439961": {"Name": "Chen Y.", "AuthorID": "7601439961", "AffiliationID": "60020870, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Lipid Research, Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology for Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute for Viral Hepatitis, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"}, "43160904000": {"Name": "Chen Y.", "AuthorID": "43160904000", "AffiliationID": "60020870", "AffiliationName": "Medical Examination Center, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"}}}
