Whereas their primary purpose is to address the organizational emergency preparedness, little is known about the personal benefits of involved participants and whether these positive changes endure over time. Methods: Immediate and medium term assessment of the effectiveness on individual preparedness and benefits of participants, based on self-perception, after participating in a set of 4 interdisciplinary field exercises organized as part of the MSc in Global Health-Disaster Medicine of the Medical School of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece. The field exercises were carried out yearly, from 2016 to 2019. Data were collected via questionnaires pre- and post-exercise (1 week and 10 months after participation). The sample size was 228 trainees, with a response rate of 88%. Results: The majority (95%) stated that Mass Casualty Incident (MCI) exercises are appropriate for disaster management training in terms of comprehending theory, and for team-building training. In the case of a real MCI, 22% of the participants declared themselves to be ready to respond prior to MCI exercises. Upon completion, the overall perception of readiness among the participants increased to 77%. Trainee feedback indicated enhancement of both technical and non-technical skills (87%), which were persistent over time, and revealed a high level of satisfaction with the training. Conclusion: This study shows a positive immediate and medium-term impact of operation-based exercises on technical, non-technical skills, and self-perception of participants.", "AuthorKeywords": ["disaster preparedness", "disaster training", "non-technical skills", "simulation exercise"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095821180", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"55405970600": {"Name": "Pikoulis E.", "AuthorID": "55405970600", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Global Health-Disaster Medicine Program, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "24469599800": {"Name": "Karamagioli E.", "AuthorID": "24469599800", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Global Health-Disaster Medicine Program, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "57202279260": {"Name": "Kalogeropoulos A.", "AuthorID": "57202279260", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Global Health-Disaster Medicine Program, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "57208273463": {"Name": "Pikoulis A.", "AuthorID": "57208273463", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Global Health-Disaster Medicine Program, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "40361377000": {"Name": "Lykoudis P.", "AuthorID": "40361377000", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Global Health-Disaster Medicine Program, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "35724533800": {"Name": "Remick K.", "AuthorID": "35724533800", "AffiliationID": "60006762", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Uniformed Services University School of Medicine"}, "14016360100": {"Name": "Malone D.", "AuthorID": "14016360100", "AffiliationID": "60006762", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Uniformed Services University School of Medicine"}, "6701712470": {"Name": "Elster E.", "AuthorID": "6701712470", "AffiliationID": "60006762", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Uniformed Services University School of Medicine"}, "7102584838": {"Name": "Rich N.", "AuthorID": "7102584838", "AffiliationID": "60006762", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Uniformed Services University School of Medicine"}, "7006654954": {"Name": "Kushner A.", "AuthorID": "7006654954", "AffiliationID": "60006183", "AffiliationName": "Department of International Health, Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health"}, "7004546944": {"Name": "Domres B.", "AuthorID": "7004546944", "AffiliationID": "60017246", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, University of T\u00fcbingen"}, "7006103698": {"Name": "Lepp\u00e4niemi A.", "AuthorID": "7006103698", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, University of Helsinki"}, "6603767537": {"Name": "Exadaktylos A.", "AuthorID": "6603767537", "AffiliationID": "60020486", "AffiliationName": "Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Bern"}}}
