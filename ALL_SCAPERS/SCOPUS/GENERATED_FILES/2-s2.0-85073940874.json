Previous UK research, based on self-report surveys, suggests that a loosely specified model has resulted in wide variations in CRTs\u2019 service delivery, organization and outcomes. A fidelity scale (developed through evidence review and stakeholder consensus) provided a means of objectively measuring adherence to a model of good practice for CRTs, via one-day fidelity reviews of UK crisis teams. Reviews included interviews with service users, carers, staff and managers, and examination of data, policies, protocols and anonymized case notes. Of the 75 teams reviewed, 49 (65%) were assessed as being moderate fidelity and the rest as low fidelity, with no team achieving high fidelity. The median score was 122 (range: 73\u2013151; inter-quartile range: 111\u2013132). Teams achieved higher scores on items about structure and organization, for example ease of referral, medication and safety systems, but scored poorly on items about the content of care and interventions. Despite a national mandate to implement the CRT model, there are wide variations in implementation in the UK and no teams in our sample achieved overall high fidelity. This suggests that a mandatory national policy is not in itself sufficient to achieve good quality implementation of a service model. The CRT Fidelity Scale provides a feasible and acceptable means to objectively assess model fidelity in CRTs. There is a need for development and testing of interventions to enhance model fidelity and facilitate improvements to these services.", "AuthorKeywords": ["clinical audit", "crisis intervention", "crisis resolution team", "cross-sectional survey", "mental health", "model fidelity", "patient participation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Crisis Intervention", "Home Care Services", "Humans", "Mental Disorders", "Mental Health Services", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073940874", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatric Mental Health", "NURS", "2921"]], "AuthorData": {"57192197210": {"Name": "Lamb D.", "AuthorID": "57192197210", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "35311223300": {"Name": "Lloyd-Evans B.", "AuthorID": "35311223300", "AffiliationID": "60161451", "AffiliationName": "Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56602961300": {"Name": "Fullarton K.", "AuthorID": "56602961300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57189923687": {"Name": "Osborn D.", "AuthorID": "57189923687", "AffiliationID": "60161451", "AffiliationName": "Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6701418714": {"Name": "Pilling S.", "AuthorID": "6701418714", "AffiliationID": "60161451", "AffiliationName": "Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36727828500": {"Name": "Milton A.", "AuthorID": "36727828500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56270013700": {"Name": "Burgess E.", "AuthorID": "56270013700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56602889400": {"Name": "Churchard A.", "AuthorID": "56602889400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57203180480": {"Name": "Davidson M.", "AuthorID": "57203180480", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57192201633": {"Name": "Frerichs J.", "AuthorID": "57192201633", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57192189286": {"Name": "Hindle D.", "AuthorID": "57192189286", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56602448200": {"Name": "Paterson B.", "AuthorID": "56602448200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56602358600": {"Name": "Wheeler C.", "AuthorID": "56602358600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7406331085": {"Name": "Johnson S.", "AuthorID": "7406331085", "AffiliationID": "60161451", "AffiliationName": "Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8511786600": {"Name": "Nolan F.", "AuthorID": "8511786600", "AffiliationID": "60161451", "AffiliationName": "Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55420364300": {"Name": "Kelly K.", "AuthorID": "55420364300", "AffiliationID": "124837660", "AffiliationName": "Northamptonshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6506385456": {"Name": "Goater N.", "AuthorID": "6506385456", "AffiliationID": "60024837", "AffiliationName": "West London NHS Trust"}, "7004241930": {"Name": "Mason O.", "AuthorID": "7004241930", "AffiliationID": "60107401", "AffiliationName": "North East London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7403690154": {"Name": "Gray R.", "AuthorID": "7403690154", "AffiliationID": "60019611", "AffiliationName": "University of West of England"}, "55565071000": {"Name": "Brown E.", "AuthorID": "55565071000", "AffiliationID": "60019611", "AffiliationName": "University of West of England"}, "24069481600": {"Name": "Sullivan S.A.", "AuthorID": "24069481600", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University of Bristol"}, "57209808331": {"Name": "Henderson C.", "AuthorID": "57209808331", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King\u2019s College London"}, "57203190341": {"Name": "Piotrowski J.", "AuthorID": "57203190341", "AffiliationID": "60032797", "AffiliationName": "Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust"}}}
