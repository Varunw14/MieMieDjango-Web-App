A promising tool to accurately describe the rheological behaviour of soft materials is fractional calculus. However, its use in the scientific community remains limited due to the unusual notation and non-trivial properties of fractional operators. This review aims to provide a clear and accessible description of fractional viscoelastic models for a broad audience and to demonstrate the ability of these models to deliver a unified approach for the characterisation of power-law materials. The use of a consistent framework for the analysis of rheological data would help classify the empirical behaviours of soft and biological materials, and better understand their response.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Fractional calculus", "Fractional operators", "Internal structure", "Power law materials", "Rheological behaviour", "Scientific community", "Viscoelastic models", "Viscoelastic response"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087709078", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"56526936500": {"Name": "Bonfanti A.", "AuthorID": "56526936500", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge"}, "57217860530": {"Name": "Kaplan J.L.", "AuthorID": "57217860530", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge"}, "23008923600": {"Name": "Kabla A.", "AuthorID": "23008923600", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge"}, "57208458979": {"Name": "Charras G.", "AuthorID": "57208458979", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}}}
