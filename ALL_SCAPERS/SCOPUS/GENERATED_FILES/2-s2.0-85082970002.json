The mechanism underlying the benefit for the motor symptoms in PD is related to the modulation of firing patterns within the hyperdirect projections from motor cortical areas, as well as within the afferent and efferent fibers to the motor STN. Advancements in neuroimaging techniques allow us to identify precisely the STN optimizing surgical targeting. In this review, we provide an update on the current uses of STN-DBS as a routine therapy as well as its experimental indications in PD, the critical aspects associated with its successful implementation and recent advances in DBS technology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deep brain stimulation", "lead technology", "neuroimaging", "neuroimaging side effects", "neurophysiology", "side effects", "subthalamic nucleus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cortical areas", "Deep brain stimulation", "Firing patterns", "LEAD Technologies", "Neuroimaging techniques", "Side effect", "Subthalamic nucleus", "Deep Brain Stimulation", "Humans", "Motor Cortex", "Parkinson Disease", "Subthalamic Nucleus", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082970002", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"35722502400": {"Name": "Macerollo A.", "AuthorID": "35722502400", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Functional Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "17136524800": {"Name": "Zrinzo L.", "AuthorID": "17136524800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, University College London, Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "23768093200": {"Name": "Akram H.", "AuthorID": "23768093200", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, University College London, Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "57215196433": {"Name": "Foltynie T.", "AuthorID": "57215196433", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, University College London, Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "7003880315": {"Name": "Limousin P.", "AuthorID": "7003880315", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, University College London, Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}}}
