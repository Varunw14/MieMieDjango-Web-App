Garnets yield low temperature conditions as determined by monomineral thermobarometry. The mantle lithosphere is sharply divided at 4.2 GPa, marked by a high temperature Cpx-Ilm-Phl trend, eclogites and changes in pyrope geochemistry. Seven layers are detected: Ist layer at 2.5\u20131 GPa is enriched mantle (Fe#Ol ~ 0.11 \u2212 0.14) with Gar- pyroxenites and Sp peridotites; IInd at 2.5\u20133.2 GPa\u2013Gar-Sp (Fe#Ol 0.08 \u2212 0.10) peridotite. IIId at 4.3\u20133.2 GPa is formed of Archaean- Proterozoic peridotites with Fe#Ol ~0.07 \u2212 0.095. IVth at 3.2\u20135 GPa- contains pyroxenitic Gar with higher Ca, eclogites, Chr and Cpx (Fe#Ol ~0.10 \u2212 0.125); Vth at 5.8 \u2212 5 GPa is marked by sub-Ca garnets, Cr-rich chromites and Mg-Cr ilmenites; VIth layer at 5.8\u20136.8 GPa contains Fe-enriched pyropes, almandines and Cr-Mg ilmenites near the lithosphere base; VIIth layer > 6.8 GPa consists of \u2018hot\u2019 Fe-rich garnets. Garnets show increasing enrichment in LREE, LILE, Hf, Zr with decreasing pressure. Primitive garnets have round REE patterns; depleted ones have S-type patterns inflected at Nd. Garnets from 6.5 to 3 GPa show increasing La/Ybn, Zr-Hf, LILE. Peridotitic clinopyroxenes have inclined linear trace element patterns rounded from La to Pr with high LILE and HFSE levels. The Fe-rich group (reacted with eclogites) shows bell-shaped irregular patterns with LILE close to the LREE levels. A possible reason for LILE (HFSE and) enrichment of the upper part of the mantle is subduction metasomatsm in Archaean times (with participation of mature continental sediments) activated by plumes at 1.8 Ga and earlier which produced pervasive focused melt flow with remelting of mica-amphibole metasomatites giving continuous REE and LILE enrichment in mantle lithologies from 5.8 to 2.5 GPa.", "AuthorKeywords": ["craton", "crust", "fluid", "garnet", "HFSE", "ilmenite", "incompatible element", "kimberlite", "LILE", "Mantle lithosphere Ukrainian shield", "Priazovie", "thermobarometry"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087031917", "SubjectAreas": [["Geology", "EART", "1907"]], "AuthorData": {"6603845588": {"Name": "Ashchepkov I.V.", "AuthorID": "6603845588", "AffiliationID": "60073372, 60017604", "AffiliationName": "V.S.Sobolev Institute of Geology and Mineralogy, SB RAS"}, "6506807785": {"Name": "Khmelnikova O.S.", "AuthorID": "6506807785", "AffiliationID": "60073372, 60017604", "AffiliationName": "V.S.Sobolev Institute of Geology and Mineralogy, SB RAS"}, "6701542840": {"Name": "Vladykin N.V.", "AuthorID": "6701542840", "AffiliationID": "60103873", "AffiliationName": "A.P.Vinogradov Institute of Geochemistry SB RAS"}, "57217291353": {"Name": "Kalashnyk H.A.", "AuthorID": "57217291353", "AffiliationID": "60008300", "AffiliationName": "Flight Academy of National Aviation University"}, "55786261500": {"Name": "Medvedev N.S.", "AuthorID": "55786261500", "AffiliationID": "60069254, 60017604", "AffiliationName": "Nikolaev Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, SB RAS"}, "7003667465": {"Name": "Saprykin A.I.", "AuthorID": "7003667465", "AffiliationID": "60069254, 60017604", "AffiliationName": "Nikolaev Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, SB RAS"}, "57207506826": {"Name": "Downes H.", "AuthorID": "57207506826", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Birkbeck University of London"}}}
