Current cultivation methods produce titers of 105\u2013107 transduction unit (TU)/mL; thus, it is necessary to concentrate LVs as well as remove process- and product-related impurities. In this work, we used a packaging cell line WinPac-RD-HV for LV production to simplify upstream processing. A direct capture method based on ion-exchange chromatography and cellulose nanofibers for LV concentration and purification was developed. This novel scalable stationary phase provides a high surface area that is accessible to LV and, therefore, has potential for high-capacity operation compared to traditional bead-based supports. We were able to concentrate LVs 100-fold while achieving a two-log removal of host cell protein and maintaining up to a 90% yield of functional vector.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072863201", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"23036916000": {"Name": "Ruscic J.", "AuthorID": "23036916000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56102945500": {"Name": "Perry C.", "AuthorID": "56102945500", "AffiliationID": "60000365", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Therapies Division, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, Blanche Lane"}, "8410544700": {"Name": "Mukhopadhyay T.", "AuthorID": "8410544700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "6602592324": {"Name": "Bracewell D.G.", "AuthorID": "6602592324", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "51764542600": {"Name": "Takeuchi Y.", "AuthorID": "51764542600", "AffiliationID": "60000365", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Therapies Division, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, Blanche Lane"}}}
