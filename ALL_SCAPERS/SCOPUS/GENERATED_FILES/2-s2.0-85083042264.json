Collagen type VI (COL6) is produced by fibroblasts, and the COL6 \u03b13-chain has shown to be elevated in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). Measuring COL6\u03b13 in serum may therefore have potential as a biomarker for gastrointestinal disorders. The aims of this study were to develop and validate a competitive ELISA targeting a specific neo-epitope of COL6\u03b13 and evaluate its associations with the gastrointestinal disorders UC, CD and CRC, in comparison to healthy controls. A monoclonal antibody was raised against a matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 specific cleavage site of COL6\u03b13 (C6M\u03b13) and employed in a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The assay was developed and technically validated. Levels of C6M\u03b13 were measured in serum from patients with UC (n = 58), CD (n = 44) and CRC (n = 39) and compared to healthy controls (n = 32). The levels of C6M\u03b13 were elevated in patients with UC, CD and CRC patients compared to healthy controls (all p < 0.0001). The area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve for separation of patients with UC from healthy controls was 0.972 (95% CI: 0.925\u20131.020, p < 0.0001), with CD from healthy controls was 0.947 (95% CI: 0.885\u20131.009, p < 0.0001) and with CRC from healthy controls was 0.890 (95% CI: 0.809\u20130.972, p < 0.0001). We developed a technically robust assay targeting a fragment of COL6, which was elevated in serum from patients with UC, CD and CRC.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Biomarkers", "Case-Control Studies", "Colitis, Ulcerative", "Collagen Type VI", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Crohn Disease", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Female", "Healthy Volunteers", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "ROC Curve", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083042264", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57203746142": {"Name": "Holm Nielsen S.", "AuthorID": "57203746142", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biotechnology and Biomedicine, Technical University of Denmark"}, "56487081300": {"Name": "Mortensen J.H.", "AuthorID": "56487081300", "AffiliationID": "60009673", "AffiliationName": "Nordic Bioscience, Biomarkers and Research"}, "39863655500": {"Name": "Willumsen N.", "AuthorID": "39863655500", "AffiliationID": "60009673", "AffiliationName": "Nordic Bioscience, Biomarkers and Research"}, "57192916706": {"Name": "Rasmussen D.G.K.", "AuthorID": "57192916706", "AffiliationID": "60009673", "AffiliationName": "Nordic Bioscience, Biomarkers and Research"}, "12798086700": {"Name": "Leeming D.J.", "AuthorID": "12798086700", "AffiliationID": "60009673", "AffiliationName": "Nordic Bioscience, Biomarkers and Research"}, "6602506854": {"Name": "Karsdal M.A.", "AuthorID": "6602506854", "AffiliationID": "60009673", "AffiliationName": "Nordic Bioscience, Biomarkers and Research"}, "57201868039": {"Name": "Genovese F.", "AuthorID": "57201868039", "AffiliationID": "60009673", "AffiliationName": "Nordic Bioscience, Biomarkers and Research"}, "57194594326": {"Name": "Mogensen D.J.", "AuthorID": "57194594326", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biotechnology and Biomedicine, Technical University of Denmark"}, "15052006700": {"Name": "Klinge L.", "AuthorID": "15052006700", "AffiliationID": "60019160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, University of Odense"}, "7004569600": {"Name": "Kjeldsen J.", "AuthorID": "7004569600", "AffiliationID": "60019160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, University of Odense"}, "6603698114": {"Name": "Di Sabatino A.", "AuthorID": "6603698114", "AffiliationID": "60015197, 60026556", "AffiliationName": "First Department of Internal Medicine, San Matteo Hospital Foundation, University of Pavia"}, "55018594900": {"Name": "Giuffrida P.", "AuthorID": "55018594900", "AffiliationID": "60015197, 60026556", "AffiliationName": "First Department of Internal Medicine, San Matteo Hospital Foundation, University of Pavia"}, "56672501300": {"Name": "Mazza G.", "AuthorID": "56672501300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College of London, Institute for Liver and Digestive Health"}, "7005412715": {"Name": "Pinzani M.", "AuthorID": "7005412715", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College of London, Institute for Liver and Digestive Health"}, "7201960327": {"Name": "J\u00f8rgensen L.N.", "AuthorID": "7201960327", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60025840", "AffiliationName": "Digestive Disease Center, Bispebjerg Hospital, University of Copenhagen"}}}
