However, non-invasive imaging techniques to investigate brain function throughout neurodevelopment are limited due to growth in head-size with age and substantial head movement in young participants. Experimental designs to probe brain function are also limited by the unnatural environment typical brain imaging systems impose. However, developments in quantum technology allowed fabrication of a new generation of wearable magnetoencephalography (MEG) technology with the potential to revolutionise electrophysiological measures of brain activity. Here we demonstrate a lifespan-compliant MEG system, showing recordings of high fidelity data in toddlers, young children, teenagers and adults. We show how this system can support new types of experimental paradigm involving naturalistic learning. This work reveals a new approach to functional imaging, providing a robust platform for investigation of neurodevelopment in health and disease.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cognition", "Electrophysiology", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Magnetoencephalography", "Male", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074742480", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57201632590": {"Name": "Hill R.M.", "AuthorID": "57201632590", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham"}, "57191490424": {"Name": "Boto E.", "AuthorID": "57191490424", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham"}, "57201420913": {"Name": "Holmes N.", "AuthorID": "57201420913", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham"}, "57210724502": {"Name": "Seedat Z.A.", "AuthorID": "57210724502", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham"}, "57197534488": {"Name": "Leggett J.", "AuthorID": "57197534488", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham"}, "57201428018": {"Name": "Roberts G.", "AuthorID": "57201428018", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham"}, "7005010989": {"Name": "Bowtell R.R.", "AuthorID": "7005010989", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham"}, "8599486300": {"Name": "Brookes M.J.", "AuthorID": "8599486300", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham"}, "55020775300": {"Name": "Hartley C.", "AuthorID": "55020775300", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60008323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "36057048100": {"Name": "Slater R.", "AuthorID": "36057048100", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60008323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "7201440598": {"Name": "Shah V.", "AuthorID": "7201440598", "AffiliationID": "60112977", "AffiliationName": "QuSpin Inc."}, "56921739000": {"Name": "Tierney T.M.", "AuthorID": "56921739000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London, 12 Queen Square"}, "7202142345": {"Name": "Barnes G.R.", "AuthorID": "7202142345", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London, 12 Queen Square"}, "6602694140": {"Name": "Woolrich M.W.", "AuthorID": "6602694140", "AffiliationID": "60000940, 60002634", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Centre for Human Brain Activity (OHBA), Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuro-Imaging, Department of psychiatry, University of Oxford, Warneford Hospital"}, "6604063407": {"Name": "Stagg C.J.", "AuthorID": "6604063407", "AffiliationID": "60000940, 60002634", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Centre for Human Brain Activity (OHBA), Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuro-Imaging, Department of psychiatry, University of Oxford, Warneford Hospital"}}}
