In this chapter, we discuss potential neuroprotective agents that are present naturally and examine their role and suitability as therapies in glaucoma. These agents have been found to have anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory mechanisms of action which may aid the resilience of retinal ganglion cells and enable them to withstand potential insults that trigger cell death. We highlight how these properties could be translated into clinical practice and the barriers needing to be overcome in order to achieve this.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Curcumin", "Glaucoma", "Natural", "Neuroprotectants", "Resveratrol", "Ubiquinone"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088221817", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"57218192622": {"Name": "Patel R.P.", "AuthorID": "57218192622", "AffiliationID": "60007419", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham and Midland Eye Centre"}, "57195998108": {"Name": "Shamsher E.", "AuthorID": "57195998108", "AffiliationID": "60000239, 60030219", "AffiliationName": "Jules-Gonin Eye Hospital, University of Lausanne"}, "57214381694": {"Name": "Hill D.", "AuthorID": "57214381694", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57210287162": {"Name": "Cordeiro M.F.", "AuthorID": "57210287162", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60016550", "AffiliationName": "Western Eye Hospital Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}}}
