Three-point bending and standardized dead-weight loading tests were conducted to determine the advantages offered by the extra outer layer. Deformation and fracture behaviour, at temperatures up to 1100\u00b0C, of two-layer, monolithic and tempered-monolithic briquettes were compared. Measurements indicated that the two-layer briquettes were more resistant to fracture at high temperatures: > 850\u00b0C they showed more extensive plastically deformed regions than monolithic briquettes. The influence of temper was consistent with previous results: tempering caused quasi-stable fracture and reduced fracture strength. The results suggest extra outer layers assisted in preventing catastrophic failure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["high-temperature performance", "mechanical properties", "multilayer ceramics", "Roman crucibles"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089543609", "SubjectAreas": [["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"57218555467": {"Name": "Gardner C.", "AuthorID": "57218555467", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "8865081200": {"Name": "M\u00fcller N.S.", "AuthorID": "8865081200", "AffiliationID": "100737531", "AffiliationName": "Fitch Laboratory, British School at Athens"}, "6603120018": {"Name": "Freestone I.C.", "AuthorID": "6603120018", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "7003946785": {"Name": "Vekinis G.", "AuthorID": "7003946785", "AffiliationID": "60001104", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, NCSR Demokritos"}, "6701772230": {"Name": "Kilikoglou V.", "AuthorID": "6701772230", "AffiliationID": "60001104", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, NCSR Demokritos"}}}
