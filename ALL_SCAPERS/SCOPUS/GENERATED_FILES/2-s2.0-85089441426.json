The latter is defined as a mode of domination whereby an exogenous hegemonic power aims to displace and dispossess the native society in order to establish a new permanent homeland. These arguments are developed by exploring the case of Israeli currency circulation in the occupied Palestinian territories. To this purpose, the heterodox critique of the classical theory of money is employed to provide a fresh geopolitical reading of the origins, evolution, implications, and continued viability of a so-called \u2018settler currency.\u2019 It is found that Israel\u2019s settler colonial project has been expedited by the enforced shekelization of the oPt, in that the latter not only acts as a barrier to industrialization and economic liberation in line with other hegemonic institutions, but also offers a sophisticated tool for coercion that directly assists the hegemon\u2019s political ends. It follows that a settler colonial currency represents a multifaceted vehicle that facilitates the settler state\u2019s reproduction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["B520", "colonialism", "currency policy", "E50", "F540", "hegemony", "Money", "Palestine", "power"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089441426", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"57218532884": {"Name": "Merrino S.", "AuthorID": "57218532884", "AffiliationID": "60103891", "AffiliationName": "School of Finance and Management, SOAS University of London"}}}
