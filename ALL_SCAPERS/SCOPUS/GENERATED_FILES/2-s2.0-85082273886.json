All rights reserved.Thermal processes of wastes lead to the production of energy in the form of electricity and/or heat. However, if the goal is to produce materials, thermochemical processes can be applied. These processes via, for example, gasification produce raw syngas that is a mixture of principal H2, CO, and CO2, with some impurities. This raw syngas is traditionally cleaned and catalytically treated via chemical processes such as Fischer-Tropsch. However, as there is a variety of microorganisms that can assimilate syngas, this gas can be used as a substrate to produce different chemicals via biochemical routes. This chapter is dedicated to describe an efficient thermochemical-biochemical route of waste treatment. The gasification process, the design, and the factors that affect the syngas composition are firstly described. Thereafter, the microbiology, biochemical reactions, metabolic pathways, and process conditions toward the production of several metabolic products from syngas such as carboxylic acids, ethanol, butanol, 2,3-butanediol, methane, and biopolymers are presented.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biochemicals", "Biofuels", "Fermentation", "Gasification", "Syngas"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082273886", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"56312203500": {"Name": "Chandolias K.", "AuthorID": "56312203500", "AffiliationID": "60033091", "AffiliationName": "University of Bor\u00e5s"}, "8445311700": {"Name": "Richards T.", "AuthorID": "8445311700", "AffiliationID": "60033091", "AffiliationName": "University of Bor\u00e5s"}, "6701407496": {"Name": "Taherzadeh M.J.", "AuthorID": "6701407496", "AffiliationID": "60033091", "AffiliationName": "University of Bor\u00e5s"}}}
