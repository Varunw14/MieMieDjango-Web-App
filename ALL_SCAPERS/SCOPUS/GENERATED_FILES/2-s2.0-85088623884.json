Re-use permitted under CC BY. Published by BMJ.Objectives In England, a significant proportion of people who take part in the national bowel cancer screening programme (BCSP) and have a positive faecal occult blood test (FOBt) result, do not attend follow-up colonoscopy (CC). The aim of this study was to investigate differences in intended participation in a follow-up investigation by diagnostic modality offered including CC, CT colonography (CTC) or capsule endoscopy (CE). Setting We performed a randomised online experiment with individuals who had previously completed an FOBt as part of the English BCSP. Methods Participants (n=953) were randomly allocated to receive one of three online vignettes asking participants to imagine they had received an abnormal FOBt result, and that they had been invited for a follow-up test. The follow-up test offered was either: CC (n=346), CTC (n=302) or CE (n=305). Participants were then asked how likely they were to have their allocated test or if they refused, either of the other tests. Respondents were also asked to cite possible emotional and practical barriers to follow up testing. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to investigate intentions. Results Intention to have the test was higher in the CTC group (96.7) compared with the CC group (91.8; OR 2.64; 95 CI 1.22 to 5.73). CTC was considered less a off-putting' (OR 0.66, 95 CI 0.47 to 0.94) and less uncomfortable compared with CC (OR 0.51, 95 CI 0.34 to 0.77). For those who did not intend to have the test they were offered, CE (39.7) or no investigation (34.5) was preferable to CC (8.6) or CTC (17.2). Conclusions Alternative tests have the potential to increase attendance at diagnostic follow-up appointments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["endoscopy", "preventive medicine", "public health"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088623884", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57193530370": {"Name": "Kaushal A.", "AuthorID": "57193530370", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "56136479100": {"Name": "Stoffel S.T.", "AuthorID": "56136479100", "AffiliationID": "60023588", "AffiliationName": "European Center of Pharmaceutical Medicine, University of Basel"}, "56513969200": {"Name": "Kerrison R.", "AuthorID": "56513969200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "23029251000": {"Name": "Von Wagner C.", "AuthorID": "23029251000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}}}
