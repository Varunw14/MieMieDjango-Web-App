Statistica Neerlandica \u00a9 2019 VVS.We introduce a new family of network models, called hierarchical network models, that allow us to represent in an explicit manner the stochastic dependence among the dyads (random ties) of the network. In particular, each member of this family can be associated with a graphical model defining conditional independence clauses among the dyads of the network, called the dependency graph. Every network model with dyadic independence assumption can be generalized to construct members of this new family. Using this new framework, we generalize the Erd\u00f6s\u2013R\u00e9nyi and the \u03b2 models to create hierarchical Erd\u00f6s\u2013R\u00e9nyi and \u03b2 models. We describe various methods for parameter estimation, as well as simulation studies for models with sparse dependency graphs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dependency graph", "exponential random graph models", "graphical models", "log-linear models", "social network analysis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076907812", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"]], "AuthorData": {"55195221000": {"Name": "Sadeghi K.", "AuthorID": "55195221000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "10641935600": {"Name": "Rinaldo A.", "AuthorID": "10641935600", "AffiliationID": "60027950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics and Data Science, Carnegie Mellon University"}}}
