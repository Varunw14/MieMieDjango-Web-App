The simplicity and clarity of the 1990 COP led to widespread uptake and high levels of consistency in external dosimetry audits. An addendum was published in 2014 to include the non-conventional conditions in Tomotherapy units. However, the 1990 COP lacked detailed recommendations for calibration conditions, and the corresponding nomenclature, to account for modern treatment units with different reference fields, including small fields as described in IAEA TRS483 (International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 2017, Vienna). This updated COP recommends the irradiation geometries, the choice of ionisation chambers, appropriate correction factors and the derivation of absorbed dose to water calibration coefficients, for carrying out reference dosimetry measurements on MV external beam radiotherapy machines. It also includes worked examples of application to different conditions. The strengths of the 1990 COP are retained: Recommending the NPL2611 chamber type as secondary standard; the use of tissue phantom ratio (TPR) as the beam quality specifier; and NPL-provided direct calibration coefficients for the user's chamber in a range of beam qualities similar to those in clinical use. In addition, the formalism is now extended to units that cannot achieve the standard reference field size of 10 cm \u00d7 10 cm, and recommendations are given for measuring dose in non-reference conditions. This COP is designed around the service that NPL provides and thus it does not require the range of different options presented in TRS483, such as generic correction factors for beam quality. This approach results in a significantly simpler, more concise and easier to follow protocol.", "AuthorKeywords": ["calibration", "megavoltage photons", "radiotherapy", "reference dosimetry"], "IndexKeywords": ["External beam radiotherapy", "High energy photons", "Institute of Physics", "International atomic energy agency", "Irradiation geometries", "Levels of consistency", "National Physical Laboratory", "Reference dosimetry"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092241582", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"7201566386": {"Name": "Eaton D.J.", "AuthorID": "7201566386", "AffiliationID": "100422203", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine (IPEM) Working Party"}, "7005157212": {"Name": "Bass G.", "AuthorID": "7005157212", "AffiliationID": "100422203", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine (IPEM) Working Party"}, "6602843379": {"Name": "Duane S.", "AuthorID": "6602843379", "AffiliationID": "100422203", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine (IPEM) Working Party"}, "11940630000": {"Name": "Thomas R.A.S.", "AuthorID": "11940630000", "AffiliationID": "100422203", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine (IPEM) Working Party"}, "57219330540": {"Name": "Booker P.", "AuthorID": "57219330540", "AffiliationID": "100422203", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine (IPEM) Working Party"}, "57219323756": {"Name": "Thorp N.", "AuthorID": "57219323756", "AffiliationID": "100422203", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine (IPEM) Working Party"}, "57204332757": {"Name": "Byrne J.", "AuthorID": "57204332757", "AffiliationID": "100422203", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine (IPEM) Working Party"}, "57191926386": {"Name": "Frame J.", "AuthorID": "57191926386", "AffiliationID": "100422203", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine (IPEM) Working Party"}, "7003836604": {"Name": "Grattan M.", "AuthorID": "7003836604", "AffiliationID": "100422203", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine (IPEM) Working Party"}, "7005065727": {"Name": "Nisbet A.", "AuthorID": "7005065727", "AffiliationID": "100422203", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine (IPEM) Working Party"}}}
