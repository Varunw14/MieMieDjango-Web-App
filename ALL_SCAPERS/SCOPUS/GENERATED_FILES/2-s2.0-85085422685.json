This approach stands in contrast with the more common and more problematic \u2018accidental urbanisation\u2019 that is unsustainable, responsive urban growth driven by population demand and economic development. Informed urbanisation offers the means to decipher cities, comprising integral systems of networks and flows, through rigorous and comprehensive analysis of the multitude of data on housing, transport, city resilience, city migration and other aspects of urban change. In this chapter we introduce an Informed Urbanisation framework and present case studies on how it is being designed and activated in the cities of Phoenix, London and Sydney.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dashboard", "Data store", "Geodesign", "Informed urbanisation", "Open data", "Rapid urbanisation", "Resilience", "Visualisation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085422685", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"57216942638": {"Name": "Petit C.", "AuthorID": "57216942638", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of the Built Environment, University of New South Wales"}, "6701682205": {"Name": "Wentz E.", "AuthorID": "6701682205", "AffiliationID": "60003892", "AffiliationName": "School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning, Arizona State University"}, "24169444100": {"Name": "Randolph B.", "AuthorID": "24169444100", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "City Futures Research Centre, Faculty of the Built Environment, University of New South Wales"}, "26436191000": {"Name": "Sanderson D.", "AuthorID": "26436191000", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of the Built Environment, University of New South Wales"}, "7102252167": {"Name": "Kelly F.", "AuthorID": "7102252167", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Research Group, King\u2019s College London"}, "6602509429": {"Name": "Beevers S.", "AuthorID": "6602509429", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Research Group, King\u2019s College London"}, "18936742300": {"Name": "Reades J.", "AuthorID": "18936742300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, King\u2019s College London"}}}
