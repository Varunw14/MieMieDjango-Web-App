Previous studies found no difference in learning between vowel harmony and disharmony; this putative equivalence has been used to discount the view that learners are influenced by substantive learning biases. In the current study, we use a more nuanced test to show that there is a clear difference in learning between vowel harmony and disharmony: learners readily infer a vowel harmony pattern, but not a disharmony pattern. The findings suggest that vowel disharmony is in fact strongly disfavored during learning.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Artificial language learning", "Learning bias", "Phonology", "Substantive bias", "Vowel harmony"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85099397994", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"56585097900": {"Name": "Martin A.", "AuthorID": "56585097900", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Language Evolution, University of Edinburgh"}, "56733088700": {"Name": "White J.", "AuthorID": "56733088700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Linguistics, University College London"}}}
