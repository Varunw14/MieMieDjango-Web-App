In this study, we developed cognitive trajectories for patients with common co-pathologies in the presence and absence of Alzheimer\u2019s disease neuropathology. Cognitive trajectories were modelled in a Bayesian hierarchical regression framework to estimate the effects of each neuropathology on cognitive decline as assessed by the mini-mental state examination and the clinical dementia rating scale sum of boxes scores. We show that both TDP-43 proteinopathy and cerebral amyloid angiopathy associate with cognitive impairment of similar magnitude to that associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease neuropathology. Within our study population, 63% of individuals given the \u2018gold-standard\u2019 neuropathological diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease in fact possessed either TDP-43 proteinopathy or cerebral amyloid angiopathy of sufficient severity to independently explain the majority of their cognitive impairment. This suggests that many individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease may actually suffer from a mixed dementia, and therapeutics targeting only Alzheimer\u2019s disease-related processes may have severely limited efficacy in these co-morbid populations.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090123769", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57205162402": {"Name": "Thomas D.X.", "AuthorID": "57205162402", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60033212", "AffiliationName": "MRC Prion Unit at UCL, UCL Institute of Prion Diseases"}, "57203103373": {"Name": "Collinge J.", "AuthorID": "57203103373", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60033212", "AffiliationName": "MRC Prion Unit at UCL, UCL Institute of Prion Diseases"}, "57211084585": {"Name": "Bajaj S.", "AuthorID": "57211084585", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "57201344757": {"Name": "McRae-McKee K.", "AuthorID": "57201344757", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "36081764800": {"Name": "Hadjichrysanthou C.", "AuthorID": "36081764800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "7408244444": {"Name": "Anderson R.M.", "AuthorID": "7408244444", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}}}
