In view of the difficulties to observe the mass mechanism of 0\u03bd\u03b2 \u03b2-decay, investigations of other mechanisms are in order. These non-standard mechanisms can be divided into short-range and long-range mechanisms. Recently, we have started systematic study for all possible short-range and long-range non-standard mechanisms. The aim of this study is twofold: I) to provide explicit formulas for the nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) and phase-space factors (PSFs) from which the decay rate for one or a combination of mechanisms operating at the same time can be calculated; II) to provide numerical values of the NMEs and PSFs obtained by making use of the microscopic interacting boson model (IBM-2) for the NMEs and of exact Dirac wave functions for the PSFs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074816055", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"6603266479": {"Name": "Kotila J.", "AuthorID": "6603266479", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Center for Theoretical Physics, Sloane Physics Laboratory, Yale University"}, "7004264505": {"Name": "Iachello F.", "AuthorID": "7004264505", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Center for Theoretical Physics, Sloane Physics Laboratory, Yale University"}, "57076011200": {"Name": "Graf L.", "AuthorID": "57076011200", "AffiliationID": "60012804", "AffiliationName": "Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Kernphysik"}, "8903178300": {"Name": "Deppisch F.", "AuthorID": "8903178300", "AffiliationID": "60025205, 60003156", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Hochenergiephysik, \u00d6sterreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften"}}}
