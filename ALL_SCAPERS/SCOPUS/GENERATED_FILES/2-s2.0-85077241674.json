Certain spin systems that are promising for such quantum memories possess \"sweet spots\" at particular combinations of magnetic fields and frequencies, where spin coherence times or linewidths become particularly favorable. In order to be able to couple high-Q superconducting resonators to such specific spin transitions, it is necessary to be able to tune the resonator frequency under a constant magnetic field amplitude. Here, we demonstrate a high-quality, magnetic field resilient superconducting resonator, using a 3D vector magnet to continuously tune its resonance frequency by adjusting the orientation of the magnetic field. The resonator maintains a quality factor of >105 up to magnetic fields of 2.6 T, applied predominantly in the plane of the superconductor. We achieve a continuous tuning of up to 30 MHz by rotating the magnetic field vector, introducing a component of 5 mT perpendicular to the superconductor.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Constant magnetic fields", "Continuous tuning", "Magnetic field vectors", "Paramagnetic spins", "Quality factors", "Quantum memory", "Resonance frequencies", "Spin transition"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077241674", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55880399400": {"Name": "Zollitsch C.W.", "AuthorID": "55880399400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "57209180835": {"Name": "O'Sullivan J.", "AuthorID": "57209180835", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, UCL"}, "57192929269": {"Name": "Kennedy O.", "AuthorID": "57192929269", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "57209181754": {"Name": "Dold G.", "AuthorID": "57209181754", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "55613970800": {"Name": "Morton J.J.L.", "AuthorID": "55613970800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}}}
