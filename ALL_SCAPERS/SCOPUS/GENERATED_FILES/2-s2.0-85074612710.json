We show that between 2000 and 2013, direct clearance of intact tropical forest areas accounted for 3.2% of gross carbon emissions from all deforestation across the pantropics. However, full carbon accounting requires the consideration of forgone carbon sequestration, selective logging, edge effects, and defaunation. When these factors were considered, the net carbon impact resulting from intact tropical forest loss between 2000 and 2013 increased by a factor of 6 (626%), from 0.34 (0.37 to 0.21) to 2.12 (2.85 to 1.00) petagrams of carbon (equivalent to approximately 2 years of global land use change emissions). The climate mitigation value of conserving the 549 million ha of tropical forest that remains intact is therefore significant but will soon dwindle if their rate of loss continues to accelerate.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anthropogenic influence", "Atmospheric carbon", "Carbon accounting", "Carbon emissions", "Carbon sequestration", "Climate mitigations", "Land-use change", "Selective logging", "Carbon", "Conservation of Natural Resources", "Forests", "Geography", "Tropical Climate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074612710", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57215570661": {"Name": "Maxwell S.L.", "AuthorID": "57215570661", "AffiliationID": "60001012", "AffiliationName": "Wildlife Conservation Society, Global Conservation Program"}, "55213700400": {"Name": "Watson J.E.M.", "AuthorID": "55213700400", "AffiliationID": "60001012", "AffiliationName": "Wildlife Conservation Society, Global Conservation Program"}, "7401454077": {"Name": "Evans T.", "AuthorID": "7401454077", "AffiliationID": "60001012", "AffiliationName": "Wildlife Conservation Society, Global Conservation Program"}, "14621461700": {"Name": "Grantham H.", "AuthorID": "14621461700", "AffiliationID": "60001012", "AffiliationName": "Wildlife Conservation Society, Global Conservation Program"}, "57211599604": {"Name": "Duncan A.", "AuthorID": "57211599604", "AffiliationID": "60001012", "AffiliationName": "Wildlife Conservation Society, Global Conservation Program"}, "57200857879": {"Name": "Wang S.", "AuthorID": "57200857879", "AffiliationID": "60001012", "AffiliationName": "Wildlife Conservation Society, Global Conservation Program"}, "24741163900": {"Name": "Morel A.", "AuthorID": "24741163900", "AffiliationID": "60009498", "AffiliationName": "Zoological Society of London"}, "7004035832": {"Name": "Malhi Y.", "AuthorID": "7004035832", "AffiliationID": "60175816", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Institute, School of Geography and the Environment, University of Oxford"}, "35793242500": {"Name": "Harris N.", "AuthorID": "35793242500", "AffiliationID": "60014872", "AffiliationName": "World Resources Institute"}, "24462074700": {"Name": "Potapov P.", "AuthorID": "24462074700", "AffiliationID": "60020304", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geographical Sciences, University of Maryland"}, "50162328700": {"Name": "Runting R.K.", "AuthorID": "50162328700", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, University of Melbourne"}, "24825475700": {"Name": "Venter O.", "AuthorID": "24825475700", "AffiliationID": "60011550", "AffiliationName": "Ecosystem Science and Management, University of Northern British Columbia"}}}
