In national parks, the problem can often be summarised as an arms race, with poachers trying to remain undetected by park rangers and other security personnel that are trying to protect the natural habitat and species from exploitation. Within this context, the detection of wire snares is a critical step. Not only can it reduce the number of animals caught by poachers but it can also help rangers develop better situation awareness and, in turn, improve patrolling strategies. To address the practical challenge of wire-snare detection across wide areas, this article examines the capacity of ground penetrating radar (GPR). Using two snares of small and medium sizes, the experiment confirmed the promising role of this technology, even if poachers attempt to conceal the snares underneath small tree branches and roots.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Detection", "Poaching", "Radar", "Snare", "Wildlife crime"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072614222", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"], ["Safety Research", "SOCI", "3311"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"22233563100": {"Name": "Borrion H.", "AuthorID": "22233563100", "AffiliationID": "60176024", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Security and Crime Science"}, "57212951602": {"Name": "Amiri A.", "AuthorID": "57212951602", "AffiliationID": "60176024", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Security and Crime Science"}, "57211078878": {"Name": "Delpech D.", "AuthorID": "57211078878", "AffiliationID": "60176024", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Security and Crime Science"}, "56324653000": {"Name": "Lemieux A.M.", "AuthorID": "56324653000", "AffiliationID": "60014526", "AffiliationName": "Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement"}}}
