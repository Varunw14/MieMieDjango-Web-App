People with a stoma are less likely to engage in PA than those without a stoma. Methods: In this feasibility intervention study, we will perform the following: (1) Develop a PA intervention for people with a stoma. An Expert Working Group of behavioural scientists, exercise scientists, clinicians and a Patient Advisory Group of people with a bowel stoma will meet with the research team to inform the development of a PA intervention for people with a stoma. A manual of the intervention will be the main output. (2) Explore PA instructors' experiences of delivering the PA intervention. PA instructors will record on paper the number of PA consultations with each patient and a researcher will interview the PA instructors about their experiences of delivering the intervention. (3) Assess the level of patient (bowel cancer or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with a stoma between 6 weeks and 24 months postsurgery) engagement with the PA intervention and their views on intervention acceptability and usefulness. Patients will keep a PA diary to record daily pedometer recorded step count and type and duration of activities. A researcher will interview patients about their experiences of the PA intervention. (4) Assess screening, eligibility, consent, data completion, loss to follow up, and missing data rates, representativeness of participants and potential treatment effects. A researcher will record on paper all study procedure parameters. Quality of life (stoma-quality of life; Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy, Short IBD questionnaire), fatigue (FACIT fatigue scale) and PA (accelerometer) will be measured pre- and post-intervention in patients. For IBD patients only, blood will be taken to measure systemic inflammation. Discussion: We hypothesise that a PA intervention will be an effective means of improving the quality of life of people with a stoma. Before embarking on a full randomised controlled trial to test this hypothesis, a PA intervention needs to be developed and a feasibility study of the proposed PA intervention conducted.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bowel cancer", "Colostomy", "Ileostomy", "Inflammatory bowel disease", "Physical activity", "Quality of life", "Stoma"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079180259", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"]], "AuthorData": {"15076862900": {"Name": "Hubbard G.", "AuthorID": "15076862900", "AffiliationID": "60105228", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nursing and Midwifery, University of the Highlands and Islands, Centre for Health Science"}, "55962806800": {"Name": "Munro J.", "AuthorID": "55962806800", "AffiliationID": "60105228", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nursing and Midwifery, University of the Highlands and Islands, Centre for Health Science"}, "36196242700": {"Name": "Beeken R.J.", "AuthorID": "36196242700", "AffiliationID": "60023959, 60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Health Sciences, University of Leeds"}, "57192268622": {"Name": "Taylor C.", "AuthorID": "57192268622", "AffiliationID": "60105470, 60022734", "AffiliationName": "St Mark's Hospital, London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "7403383307": {"Name": "Watson A.J.M.", "AuthorID": "7403383307", "AffiliationID": "60004450, 60000866", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Raigmore Hospital, NHS Highland"}, "57204050004": {"Name": "Goodman W.", "AuthorID": "57204050004", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}}}
