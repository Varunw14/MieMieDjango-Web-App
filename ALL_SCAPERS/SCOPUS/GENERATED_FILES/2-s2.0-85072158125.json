To date mainly autologous cells have been tested. However, inter-patient variability in cell recovery and quality, and the fact that the neuroprotective olfactory ensheathing cell (OEC) subset is difficult to isolate, means an allogeneic hOMC therapy would be an attractive \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d alternative. The aim of this study was to generate a candidate cell line from late-adherent hOMCs, thought to contain the OEC subset. Primary late-adherent hOMCs were transduced with a c-MycERTAM gene that enables cell proliferation in the presence of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT). Two c-MycERTAM-derived polyclonal populations, PA5 and PA7, were generated and expanded. PA5 cells had a normal human karyotype (46, XY) and exhibited faster growth kinetics than PA7, and were therefore selected for further characterisation. PA5 hOMCs express glial markers (p75NTR, S100\u00df, GFAP and oligodendrocyte marker O4), neuronal markers (nestin and \u00df-III-tubulin) and fibroblast-associated markers (CD90/Thy1 and fibronectin). Co-culture of PA5 cells with a neuronal cell line (NG108-15) and with primary dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons resulted in significant neurite outgrowth after 5 days. Therefore, c-MycERTAM-derived PA5 hOMCs have potential as a regenerative therapy for neural cells.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Animals", "Biomarkers", "Cell Line", "Coculture Techniques", "Ganglia, Spinal", "Genes, myc", "Gentamicins", "Humans", "Karyotyping", "Mice", "Neuroblastoma", "Olfactory Mucosa", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Receptors, Estrogen", "Recombinant Proteins", "Sensory Receptor Cells", "Tamoxifen", "Transduction, Genetic", "Transgenes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072158125", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57193339218": {"Name": "Santiago-Toledo G.", "AuthorID": "57193339218", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "55212954600": {"Name": "Georgiou M.", "AuthorID": "55212954600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57210996343": {"Name": "dos Reis J.", "AuthorID": "57210996343", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "55356430100": {"Name": "Roberton V.H.", "AuthorID": "55356430100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57202646192": {"Name": "Valinhas A.", "AuthorID": "57202646192", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57204019397": {"Name": "Wood R.C.", "AuthorID": "57204019397", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "Aston Medical Research Institute and School of Life & Health Sciences, Aston University"}, "7202125538": {"Name": "Mason C.", "AuthorID": "7202125538", "AffiliationID": "120657363", "AffiliationName": "AVROBIO Inc"}, "23006986500": {"Name": "Wall I.B.", "AuthorID": "23006986500", "AffiliationID": "60170569, 60002877", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Tissue Regeneration Engineering (ITREN), Dankook University"}, "9240949100": {"Name": "Phillips J.B.", "AuthorID": "9240949100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nerve Engineering"}, "57197512054": {"Name": "Sinden J.D.", "AuthorID": "57197512054", "AffiliationID": "60112717", "AffiliationName": "ReNeuron Limited"}, "23049327300": {"Name": "Choi D.", "AuthorID": "23049327300", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology & Neurosurgery"}, "27168216000": {"Name": "Li D.", "AuthorID": "27168216000", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology & Neurosurgery"}, "56021308100": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "56021308100", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology & Neurosurgery"}, "7004256602": {"Name": "Jat P.S.", "AuthorID": "7004256602", "AffiliationID": "60033212, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Prion Unit at UCL, Institute of Prion Diseases"}}}
