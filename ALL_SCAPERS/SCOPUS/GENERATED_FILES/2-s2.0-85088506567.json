Preliminary filters are aggregated in a non-linear fashion, using a new metric of pixel proximity based on how the pool of filters reaches a consensus. We provide a theoretical bound to support our aggregation scheme, its numerical performance is illustrated and we show that the aggregate significantly outperforms each of the preliminary filters.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Collaborative filtering", "Ensemble methods", "Image denoising", "Statistical aggregation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aggregation methods", "Aggregation schemes", "Non linear", "Non-linear aggregation", "Numerical performance", "Theoretical bounds"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088506567", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"23388770500": {"Name": "Guedj B.", "AuthorID": "23388770500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57218171706": {"Name": "Rengot J.", "AuthorID": "57218171706", "AffiliationID": "60026651", "AffiliationName": "Ecole des Ponts ParisTech"}}}
