To streamline this process, we developed Rigbox, a high-performance, open-source software toolbox that facilitates a modular approach to designing experiments (https://github.com/cortex-lab/Rigbox). Rigbox simplifies hardware input-output, time aligns datastreams from multiple sources, communicates with remote databases, and implements visual and auditory stimuli presentation. Its main submodule, Signals, al-lows intuitive programming of behavioral tasks. Here we illustrate its function with the following two interactive examples: a human psychophysics experiment, and the game of Pong. We give an overview of running experiments in Rigbox, provide benchmarks, and conclude with a discussion on the extensibility of the software and comparisons with similar toolboxes. Rigbox runs in MATLAB, with Java components to handle network com-munication, and a C library to boost performance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Behavioral", "Control", "Experimental", "Software", "Toolbox"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088486671", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"57218256225": {"Name": "Bhagat J.", "AuthorID": "57218256225", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57195562940": {"Name": "Wells M.J.", "AuthorID": "57195562940", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57211720309": {"Name": "Harris K.D.", "AuthorID": "57211720309", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "6701363142": {"Name": "Carandini M.", "AuthorID": "6701363142", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57195569762": {"Name": "Burgess C.P.", "AuthorID": "57195569762", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}}}
