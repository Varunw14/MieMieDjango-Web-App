However, due to these techniques gradually scaling displacements as the user moves (changing user's speed), they introduce a Drift effect. That is, a user returning to the same point in VR will not return to the same point in the real space. This mismatch between the real/virtual spaces can grow over time, and turn the techniques unusable (i.e., users cannot reach their target locations). In this paper, we characterise and analyse the effects of Drift, highlighting its potential detrimental effects. We then propose two techniques to correct Drift effects and use a data driven approach (using navigation data from real users with a specific scale adaptive technique) to tune them, compare their performance and chose an optimum correction technique and configuration. Our user study, applying our technique in a different environment and with two different scale adaptive navigation techniques, shows that our correction technique can significantly reduce Drift effects and extend the life-span of the navigation techniques (i.e., time that they can be used before Drift draws targets unreachable), while not hindering users' experience.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Drift correction", "Navigation", "Virtual reality"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptive navigation", "Adaptive technique", "Correction techniques", "Data-driven approach", "Drift correction", "Navigation techniques", "Target location", "Users' experiences"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074808608", "SubjectAreas": [["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"57192186226": {"Name": "Montano-Murillo R.A.", "AuthorID": "57192186226", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "INTERACT LAB, Department of Informatics, University of Sussex"}, "57211684693": {"Name": "Cornelio-Martinez P.I.", "AuthorID": "57211684693", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "INTERACT LAB, Department of Informatics, University of Sussex"}, "35389893300": {"Name": "Subramanian S.", "AuthorID": "35389893300", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "INTERACT LAB, Department of Informatics, University of Sussex"}, "57215517228": {"Name": "Martinez-Plasencia D.", "AuthorID": "57215517228", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "INTERACT LAB, Department of Informatics, University of Sussex"}}}
