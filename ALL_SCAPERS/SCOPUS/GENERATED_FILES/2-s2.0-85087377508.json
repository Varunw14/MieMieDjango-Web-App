Polygenic risk scores (PRS) summarizing >1 million variants for coronary artery disease (CAD) are associated with incident and recurrent CAD events. However, little is known about the influence of FHx or PRS on secondary cardiovascular events (sCVE) in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Methods: We included 1788 CEA patients from the Athero-Express Biobank. A weighted PRS for CAD including 1.7 million variants was calculated (MetaGRS). The composite endpoint of sCVE during three years of follow-up included coronary, cerebrovascular and peripheral events and cardiovascular death. We assessed the impact of FHx and MetaGRS on sCVE and carotid plaque composition. Results: Positive FHx was associated with a higher 3-year risk of sCVE independent of cardiovascular risk factors and MetaGRS (adjusted HR 1.40, 95%CI 1.07\u20131.82, p = 0.013). Patients in the highest MetaGRS quintile had a higher 3-year risk of sCVE compared to the rest of the cohort independent of cardiovascular risk factors including FHx (adjusted HR 1.35, 95%CI 1.01\u20131.79, p = 0.043), and their atherosclerotic plaques contained more fat (adjusted OR 1.59, 95%CI, 1.11\u20132.29, p = 0.013) and more macrophages (OR 1.49, 95%CI 1.12\u20131.99, p = 0.006). Conclusions: In CEA patients, both positive FHx and higher MetaGRS were independently associated with increased risk of sCVE. Moreover, higher MetaGRS was associated with vulnerable plaque characteristics. Future studies should unravel underlying mechanisms and focus on the added value of PRS and FHx in individual risk prediction for sCVE.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atherosclerosis", "Carotid artery stenosis", "Carotid endarterectomy", "Family history", "Polygenic risk score", "Vascular biology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087377508", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57211251961": {"Name": "Timmerman N.", "AuthorID": "57211251961", "AffiliationID": "60032724, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Department of Vascular Surgery, Division of Surgical Specialties, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht University"}, "7003654548": {"Name": "de Kleijn D.P.V.", "AuthorID": "7003654548", "AffiliationID": "60032724, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Department of Vascular Surgery, Division of Surgical Specialties, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht University"}, "24464360800": {"Name": "de Borst G.J.", "AuthorID": "24464360800", "AffiliationID": "60032724, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Department of Vascular Surgery, Division of Surgical Specialties, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht University"}, "7004573949": {"Name": "Pasterkamp G.", "AuthorID": "7004573949", "AffiliationID": "60032724, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Clinical Chemistry and Hematology, Division Laboratories and Pharmacy, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht University"}, "56326976300": {"Name": "Haitjema S.", "AuthorID": "56326976300", "AffiliationID": "60032724, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Clinical Chemistry and Hematology, Division Laboratories and Pharmacy, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht University"}, "57204459507": {"Name": "van der Laan S.W.", "AuthorID": "57204459507", "AffiliationID": "60032724, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Clinical Chemistry and Hematology, Division Laboratories and Pharmacy, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht University"}, "14071039800": {"Name": "den Ruijter H.M.", "AuthorID": "14071039800", "AffiliationID": "60032724, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Experimental Cardiology, Division Heart & Lungs, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht University"}, "57202567488": {"Name": "Asselbergs F.W.", "AuthorID": "57202567488", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, Faculty of Population Health Sciences, University College London"}}}
