Its holistic and integrative approach to universal human suffering means that it is well placed as a transdiagnostic therapy. Research into its effectiveness and acceptability has increased over the previous 10 years as the therapy has evolved, and to help consider its status as an evidence-based therapy research concerning its treatment outcomes needs evaluating. Areas covered: This paper reviews research investigating the effectiveness of CFT in clinical populations. Expert opinion: CFT shows promise for a range of mental health problems, especially when delivered in a group format over at least 12 hours. This is important for funding bodies and commissioning groups to consider as they allocate healthcare resources in light of current evidence-based practice. CFT is demonstrably well accepted by clients and clinicians and there is now a clear need for an updated, universally deployed, standard manual to direct future research. This will be critical in enabling widespread implementation and further adoption into mainstream clinical practice, will address the lack of standardization in the current research, and pave the way for further randomized control trials aimed at reducing existing methodological limitations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CFT", "compassion", "compassion focused therapy", "mental health", "psychological therapy", "psychotherapy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083566209", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57203916941": {"Name": "Craig C.", "AuthorID": "57203916941", "AffiliationID": "121485749", "AffiliationName": "Buckinghamshire Older People\u2019s Psychology Services, The Whiteleaf Centre"}, "6507878082": {"Name": "Hiskey S.", "AuthorID": "6507878082", "AffiliationID": "100838562", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Psychology, The Oaks Hospital"}, "7203039292": {"Name": "Spector A.", "AuthorID": "7203039292", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology University College London"}}}
