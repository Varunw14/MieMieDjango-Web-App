All rights reserved.The Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain that includes the Hawaiian volcanoes was created by the Hawaiian mantle plume. Although the mantle plume hypothesis predicts an oceanic plateau produced by massive decompression melting during the initiation stage of the Hawaiian hot spot, the fate of this plateau is unclear. We discovered a megameter-scale portion of thickened oceanic crust in the uppermost lower mantle west of the Sea of Okhotsk by stacking seismic waveforms of SS precursors. We propose that this thick crust represents a major part of the oceanic plateau that was created by the Hawaiian plume head ~100 million years ago and subducted 20 million to 30 million years ago. Our discovery provides temporal and spatial clues of the early history of the Hawaiian plume for future plate reconstructions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096458770", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56404952500": {"Name": "Wei S.S.", "AuthorID": "56404952500", "AffiliationID": "60031707", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Michigan State University"}, "56118799600": {"Name": "Tian D.", "AuthorID": "56118799600", "AffiliationID": "60031707", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Michigan State University"}, "57204279718": {"Name": "Shearer P.M.", "AuthorID": "57204279718", "AffiliationID": "60121582, 60030612, 60023018", "AffiliationName": "Cecil H. and Ida M.
