British Journal of Haematology published by British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons LtdThis phase II trial was designed to determine the safety and efficacy of a modified paediatric risk-stratified protocol in young adults (18\u201330 years) with classical Hodgkin Lymphoma. The primary end-point was neurotoxicity rate. The incidence of grade 3 neurotoxicity was 11% (80% CI, 5\u201319%); a true rate of neuropathy of >15% cannot be excluded. Neuropathy and associated deterioration in quality of life was largely reversible. The overall response rate was 100% with 40% complete remission (CR) rate. Twelve months disease-free survival (DFS) was 91%. We demonstrate that a risk-stratified paediatric combined modality treatment approach can be delivered to young adults without significant irreversible neuropathy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hodgkin lymphoma", "neuropathy", "paediatric"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Disease-Free Survival", "Female", "Hodgkin Disease", "Humans", "Male", "Quality of Life", "Risk Factors", "Survival Rate", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074978790", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"40262704000": {"Name": "Townsend W.", "AuthorID": "40262704000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK and University College London Cancer Trials Centre"}, "57211781495": {"Name": "Leong S.", "AuthorID": "57211781495", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation trust"}, "14634099500": {"Name": "Linch D.", "AuthorID": "14634099500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK and University College London Cancer Trials Centre"}, "6603239253": {"Name": "Ardeshna K.", "AuthorID": "6603239253", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK and University College London Cancer Trials Centre"}, "35300498800": {"Name": "Patrick P.", "AuthorID": "35300498800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK and University College London Cancer Trials Centre"}, "56719092100": {"Name": "Lopes A.", "AuthorID": "56719092100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK and University College London Cancer Trials Centre"}, "57189515467": {"Name": "Clifton-Hadley L.", "AuthorID": "57189515467", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK and University College London Cancer Trials Centre"}, "23137597600": {"Name": "Hoskin P.", "AuthorID": "23137597600", "AffiliationID": "60006776", "AffiliationName": "Marie Curie Research Wing, Mount Vernon Cancer Centre"}, "23026846700": {"Name": "Diez P.", "AuthorID": "23026846700", "AffiliationID": "60006776", "AffiliationName": "National Radiotherapy Trials Quality Assurance Group, Mount Vernon Cancer Centre"}, "7403972482": {"Name": "Wong W.L.", "AuthorID": "7403972482", "AffiliationID": "60006776", "AffiliationName": "Paul Strickland Scanner Centre, Mount Vernon Cancer Centre"}, "8925210200": {"Name": "Sanghera B.", "AuthorID": "8925210200", "AffiliationID": "60006776", "AffiliationName": "Paul Strickland Scanner Centre, Mount Vernon Cancer Centre"}, "8960246500": {"Name": "Kayani I.", "AuthorID": "8960246500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, University College Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36058690200": {"Name": "Daw S.", "AuthorID": "36058690200", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Oncology, University College Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "23024396800": {"Name": "Collins G.", "AuthorID": "23024396800", "AffiliationID": "60021328", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Cancer and Haematology Centre, Churchill Hospital"}}}
