Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.(1) Background: Intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD) in adults is characterized by steatosis with variable progression to fibrosis/cirrhosis. Reference standard liver biopsy is not feasible for all patients, but non-invasive serological and quantitative MRI markers for diagnosis/monitoring have not been previously validated. Here, we examine the potential of serum scores and feasibility of quantitative MRI used in non-IFALD liver diseases for the diagnosis of IFALD steatosis; (2) Methods: Clinical and biochemical parameters were used to calculate serum scores in patients on home parenteral nutrition (HPN) with/without IFALD steatosis. A sub-group underwent multiparameter quantitative MRI measurements of liver fat fraction, iron content, tissue T1, liver blood flow and small bowel motility; (3) Results: Compared to non-IFALD (n = 12), patients with IFALD steatosis (n = 8) demonstrated serum score elevations in Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (p = 0.032), Aspartate transaminase-to-Platelet Ratio Index (p < 0.001), Fibrosis-4 Index (p = 0.010), Forns Index (p = 0.001), Gamma-glutamyl transferase-to-Platelet Ratio Index (p = 0.002) and Fibrosis Index (p = 0.001). Quantitative MRI scanning was feasible in all 10 sub-group patients. Median liver fat fraction was higher in IFALD steatosis patients (10.9% vs 2.1%, p = 0.032); other parameter differences were non-significant; (4) Conclusion: Serum scores used for non-IFALD liver diseases may be useful in IFALD steatosis.
