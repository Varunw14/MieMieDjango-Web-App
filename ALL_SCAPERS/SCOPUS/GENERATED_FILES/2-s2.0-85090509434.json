All rights reserved.Delirium is associated with dementia and thus biomarkers reflecting neurodegeneration are of interest. Fatty acid-binding protein 3 (FABP3) is a cytoplasmic neuronal protein that has been isolated from the brain. It is released following brain injury and concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are also higher in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Objective: To examine the relationship between CSF FABP3 concentration and delirium in hip fracture patients compared to a group of cognitively normal controls. Methods: CFS FABP3 concentration was measured in 128 hip fracture patients with (n=71) and without (n=57) delirium, and in cognitively unimpaired adults \u226564 years (n=124) undergoing elective surgery. Results: CSF FABP3 (pg/ml) concentration (median (IQR)) was higher in hip-fracture patients compared to cognitively normal controls (5.7 (4.2-7.7) versus 4.5 (3.4-6.1), p<0.001). There was a significant weak correlation between age and CSF FABP3 (\u03c1=0.3, p<0.001). After adjustment for age, the association between CSF FABP3 and hip-fracture was no longer statistically significant (\u03b2=0.05, p=0.5). There were no significant differences in CSF FABP3 concentration between hip fracture patients with (5.4 (4.1-8.2)) and without (5.8 (4.2-7.2)) delirium. CSF FABP3 concentration correlated positively with CSF AD biomarkers p-tau (\u03c1=0.7, p<0.01) and t-tau (\u03c1=0.7, p<0.01). Conclusion: CSF FABP3 concentrations were higher in hip fracture patients compared with cognitively normal older adults, indicating ongoing age-related neurodegeneration in these patients. There were no differences of CSF FABP3 concentrations across delirium groups, suggesting that neuronal damage or degeneration reflected by FABP3 may not be directly linked to delirium pathophysiology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers", "CSF FABP3", "delirium", "dementia", "hip-fracture"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090509434", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55520971400": {"Name": "Neerland B.E.", "AuthorID": "55520971400", "AffiliationID": "60105037", "AffiliationName": "Oslo Delirium Research Group, Oslo University Hospital"}, "57204967014": {"Name": "Halaas N.B.", "AuthorID": "57204967014", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo"}, "56798381200": {"Name": "Idland A.V.", "AuthorID": "56798381200", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo"}, "52463643800": {"Name": "Henjum K.", "AuthorID": "52463643800", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo"}, "55946965200": {"Name": "Watne L.O.", "AuthorID": "55946965200", "AffiliationID": "60105037", "AffiliationName": "Oslo Delirium Research Group, Oslo University Hospital"}, "7101909602": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "7101909602", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "57208899083": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "57208899083", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Uk Dementia Research Institute at Ucl"}}}
