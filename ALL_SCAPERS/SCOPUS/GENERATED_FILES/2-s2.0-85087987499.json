Aim: This European Society for Sexual Medicine (ESSM) statement aims to guide scientists toward utilization of the rodent model in an appropriate, timely, and proficient fashion. Methods: MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched for basic science studies, using a rodent animal model, looking into the consequence of pelvic nerve injury on erectile function. Main outcome measures: The authors present a consensus on how to best perform experiments with this rodent model, the details of the technique, and highlight possible pitfalls. Results: Owing to the specific issue\u2014basic science\u2014Oxford 2011 Levels of Evidence criteria cannot be applied. However, ESSM statements on this topic will be provided in which we summarize the ESSM position on various aspects of the model such as the use of the Animal Research Reporting In Vivo Experiments guideline and the of common range parameter for nerve stimulation. We also highlighted the translational limits of the model. Conclusion: The following statements were formulated as a suggestive guidance for scientists using the cavernous nerve injury model. With this, we hope to standardize and further improve the quality of research in this field. It must be noted that this model has its limitations. Weyne E, Ilg MM, Cakir OO, et al.
