However, the clinical application of fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) in pediatrics is just at the initial phase. Material and methods: A systematic review of current clinical uses of FGS in pediatric surgery was performed along with a discussion on its advantages, limitations and future developments. Results: 21 studies were included: 9 retrospective and 1 prospective study, 8 case reports, 2 case series and a review article reporting authors' institutional experience. Great emphasis was given to surgical resection of hepatoblastoma and its metastasis (n = 6), real-time imaging of the biliary tree (n = 3) and urogenital system (n = 2). Other current uses concern the assessment of blood perfusion (intestine, n = 3; myocutaneous flap, n = 1; transplanted liver, n = 1) and lymphatic flow imaging (n = 4). Conclusion: Despite a paucity of clinical studies evaluating its role in pediatric surgery, FGS has shown promising results in helping guide tumor resection and improving the accuracy of anatomical delineation.
