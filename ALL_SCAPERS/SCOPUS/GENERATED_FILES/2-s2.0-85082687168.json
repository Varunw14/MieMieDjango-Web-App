Africa and, particularly, Nigeria bear a major brunt of this \u2018global epidemic\u2019, which carries enormous material and human costs. Yet, eviction is frequently hidden behind forms of displacements which operate within the law, and are justified on the basis of public interest rationales. Drawing on a research project into urban infrastructure-related displacement in Nigeria, this paper explores the reported incidence, patterns and trends of urban displacements and their impacts in Nigeria over a period of six years (2010\u20132016). Through the prism of the holistic approach, it interrogates the conflicting \u2018publics\u2019 and \u2018interests\u2019 in the diverse displacement contexts, and argues that the \u2018public interest\u2019 behind official rationale for displacement is, in reality, a highly contested affair. The paper recommends that displacements, where unavoidable, ought to be planned inclusively against the background of meaningful engagement and procedural safeguards.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Demolition", "Displacement", "Forced eviction", "Nigeria", "Public interest", "Urban planning"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082687168", "SubjectAreas": [["Development", "SOCI", "3303"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"], ["Tourism, Leisure and Hospitality Management", "BUSI", "1409"]], "AuthorData": {"15748441800": {"Name": "Onyebueke V.U.", "AuthorID": "15748441800", "AffiliationID": "60025390", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urban and Regional Planning, University of Nigeria"}, "57212309843": {"Name": "Ujah O.", "AuthorID": "57212309843", "AffiliationID": "119428044", "AffiliationName": "Independent Researcher and Associate Fellow, African Heritage Institution"}, "55604589000": {"Name": "Walker J.", "AuthorID": "55604589000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Development Planning Unit, Faculty of the Built Environment, University College, London"}, "23985320300": {"Name": "Lipietz B.", "AuthorID": "23985320300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Development Planning Unit, Faculty of the Built Environment, University College, London"}, "57205489716": {"Name": "Ibezim-Ohaeri V.", "AuthorID": "57205489716", "AffiliationID": "124174149", "AffiliationName": "Space for Change"}}}
