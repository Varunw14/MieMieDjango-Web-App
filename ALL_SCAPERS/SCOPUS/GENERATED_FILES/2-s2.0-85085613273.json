Published by BMJ.Introduction In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence are amending guidelines to support use of selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) as a first-line treatment for patients with glaucoma and ocular hypertension. The procedure is quick, effective in lowering intraocular pressure, cost-effective for the National Health Service and offers an equivalent safety profile to other therapies. The procedure is typically performed by an ophthalmologist; however, there is potential for suitably trained non-medical professionals to deliver the therapy. This scoping review will identify service delivery models where SLT is delivered by non-medical professionals worldwide, with a focus on optometrists. Methods and analysis A systematic search of the following databases will be conducted: CINAHL; MEDLINE Complete; Embase; HMIC and Ovid Emcare. For inclusion, studies must examine healthcare models of SLT delivery by optometrists and describe one of the following outcomes: training procedures; clinical effectiveness; safety and cost-effectiveness. A search of grey literature will be conducted via professional societies; national health departments; medicine regulatory bodies; charities and conference proceedings. Two reviewers will independently screen titles, abstracts and full-texts articles, followed by charting of data. This evidence synthesis will summarise findings narratively, supplemented with tables and descriptive statistics. Ethics and dissemination The review focuses on published articles and therefore ethical approval is not required. The findings will be relevant to key stakeholders including health service managers, policymakers, clinicians and patients. The findings of this review will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations and summary reports for key stakeholders.", "AuthorKeywords": ["glaucoma", "intraocular pressure", "treatment lasers"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085613273", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"57190489857": {"Name": "Jones L.", "AuthorID": "57190489857", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "24576952100": {"Name": "Konstantakopoulou E.", "AuthorID": "24576952100", "AffiliationID": "60110806", "AffiliationName": "Division of Optics and Optometry, University of West Attica"}, "7004147260": {"Name": "Gazzard G.", "AuthorID": "7004147260", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}}}
