For the primal variable we use standard continuous finite element space and for the ux we use the Raviart-Thomas space. We prove optimal a priori error estimates in the H1- and the L2-norms for the primal variable in the low P\u00e9clet regime. In the high P\u00e9clet regime we also prove optimal error estimates for the primal variable in the H(div) norm for smooth solutions. Numerically we observe that the method eliminates the spurious oscillations close to interior layers that pollute the solution of the standard Galerkin method when the local P\u00e9clet number is high. This method, however, does produce spurious oscillations when outow boundary layers are present in the solution. In the last section we propose two simple strategies to remove such numerical artifacts caused by the outow boundary layer and validate them numerically.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Advection-diffiusion", "Mixed finite element method", "Primal dual method"], "IndexKeywords": ["Advection-diffusion equation", "Finite element space", "Mixed finite element methods", "Optimal a priori error estimates", "Optimal error estimate", "Primal-dual methods", "Smooth solutions", "Spurious oscillations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076271069", "SubjectAreas": [["Numerical Analysis", "MATH", "2612"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"7004271452": {"Name": "Burman E.", "AuthorID": "7004271452", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "57191827054": {"Name": "He C.", "AuthorID": "57191827054", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
