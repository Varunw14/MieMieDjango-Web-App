Published by Wiley-VCH GmbHPotassium-ion batteries (PIBs) configurated by organic electrodes have been identified as a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries. Here, a porous organic Polyimide@Ketjenblack is demonstrated in PIBs as a cathode, which exhibits excellent performance with a large reversible capacity (143 mAh g\u22121 at 100 mA g\u22121), high rate capability (125 and 105 mAh g\u22121 at 1000 and 5000 mA g\u22121), and long cycling stability (76% capacity retention at 2000 mA g\u22121 over 1000 cycles). The domination of fast capacitive-like reaction kinetics is verified, which benefits from the porous structure synthesized using in situ polymerization. Moreover, a renewable and low-cost full cell is demonstrated with superior rate behavior (106 mAh g\u22121 at 3200 mA g\u22121). This work proposes a strategy to design polymer electrodes for high-performance organic PIBs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["organic cathodes", "polyimides", "porous cathodes", "potassium-ion batteries"], "IndexKeywords": ["Capacity retention", "Cycling stability", "High rate capability", "In-situ polymerization", "Organic electrodes", "Polymer electrodes", "Porous structures", "Reversible capacity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089491798", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57192594770": {"Name": "Zhang C.", "AuthorID": "57192594770", "AffiliationID": "60030040", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics and IMN MacroNano\u00ae, Technical University of Ilmenau"}, "57192592509": {"Name": "Xu Y.", "AuthorID": "57192592509", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "16641740300": {"Name": "Zhao H.", "AuthorID": "16641740300", "AffiliationID": "60030040", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics and IMN MacroNano\u00ae, Technical University of Ilmenau"}, "57206751179": {"Name": "Wu Y.", "AuthorID": "57206751179", "AffiliationID": "60030040", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics and IMN MacroNano\u00ae, Technical University of Ilmenau"}, "6701629101": {"Name": "Hannappel T.", "AuthorID": "6701629101", "AffiliationID": "60030040", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics and IMN MacroNano\u00ae, Technical University of Ilmenau"}, "56152354500": {"Name": "Lei Y.", "AuthorID": "56152354500", "AffiliationID": "60030040", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics and IMN MacroNano\u00ae, Technical University of Ilmenau"}, "57218548825": {"Name": "He K.", "AuthorID": "57218548825", "AffiliationID": "60023813", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nanochemistry and Nanobiology, Shanghai University"}, "57202367135": {"Name": "Dong Y.", "AuthorID": "57202367135", "AffiliationID": "60023813", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nanochemistry and Nanobiology, Shanghai University"}, "57195473369": {"Name": "Medenbach L.", "AuthorID": "57195473369", "AffiliationID": "60029507", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Technical Chemistry and Environmental Chemistry, Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena"}, "24479616100": {"Name": "Balducci A.", "AuthorID": "24479616100", "AffiliationID": "60029507", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Technical Chemistry and Environmental Chemistry, Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena"}}}
