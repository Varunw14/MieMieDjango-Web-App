A comprehensive survey of households in the agropastoral area of Qinghai Province was conducted from 2017 to 2018 to identify its energy consumption characteristics. In this paper, a typical household energy flow model was established. The results show that 1) the proportion of noncommercial energy in the agropastoral area of Qinghai Province is 52.89%, and it is affected by the \u2018returning farmland to forest\u2019 (RFF) policy and the \u2018returning grazing land to grassland project\u2019 (RGLGP). Furthermore, the household energy consumption structure has shifted from traditional biomass to coal and a combination of other energy sources. 2) Households of different cultural backgrounds have different energy consumption patterns. 3) High-income households consume more energy and have more frequent energy flows compared with low-income households. The results of this survey will help policymakers and scholars to formulate strategies for energy conservation and more effectively assess energy policies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Agropastoral areas", "Energy geography", "Household energy consumption", "Material flow model", "Qinghai-tibet plateau"], "IndexKeywords": ["Agro-pastoral area", "Energy geography", "Household energy consumption", "Material Flow", "Qinghai Tibet plateau"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076672996", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57191433200": {"Name": "Jiang L.", "AuthorID": "57191433200", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London"}, "35558016700": {"Name": "Chen X.", "AuthorID": "35558016700", "AffiliationID": "60028265", "AffiliationName": "College of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Lanzhou University"}, "56603101200": {"Name": "Coffman D.M.", "AuthorID": "56603101200", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London"}, "55272317400": {"Name": "Mi Z.", "AuthorID": "55272317400", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London"}, "55724067800": {"Name": "Xue B.", "AuthorID": "55724067800", "AffiliationID": "112674270", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies"}, "57212458788": {"Name": "Xing R.", "AuthorID": "57212458788", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "University of Chinese Academy of Science"}, "44961273800": {"Name": "Song L.", "AuthorID": "44961273800", "AffiliationID": "60105683", "AffiliationName": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology"}, "35207058700": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "35207058700", "AffiliationID": "123940096", "AffiliationName": "Shanghai Institute of Eco-Chongming (SIEC)"}}}
