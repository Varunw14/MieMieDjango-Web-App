Unguarding of the mitral valvar orifice has previously been reported in the setting of mirror-imaged atrial arrangement. We report a neonate with unguarding of the mitral valvar orifice in the setting of usual atrial arrangement, but with discordant atrioventricular connections and pulmonary atresia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atrioventricular discordance", "mitral incompetence", "pulmonary atresia"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078279519", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57212620876": {"Name": "Banerji N.", "AuthorID": "57212620876", "AffiliationID": "60007898", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Cardiology, Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences"}, "55204018100": {"Name": "Krishna M.", "AuthorID": "55204018100", "AffiliationID": "60007898", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Cardiology, Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences"}, "57203775019": {"Name": "Kumar R.", "AuthorID": "57203775019", "AffiliationID": "60007898", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Cardiology, Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences"}, "55574190847": {"Name": "Anderson R.", "AuthorID": "55574190847", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Genetic Medicine, Newcastle University"}}}
