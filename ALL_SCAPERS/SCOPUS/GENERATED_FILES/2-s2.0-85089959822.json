British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British Pharmacological SocietyAim: To evaluate the type (licensed vs unlicensed) and cost of preparations used to fulfil vitamin D prescriptions in England over time, and to compare measured vitamin D content of selected vitamin D preparations against labelled claim. Methods: Retrospective analysis of vitamin D prescription data in primary care in England (2008-2018). Laboratory analysis of 13 selected vitamin D preparations. Results: Alongside a rise in the number of oral licensed colecalciferol preparations from 0 to 27 between 2012 and 2018, the proportion of vitamin D prescriptions in which licensed vitamin D preparations were supplied increased from 11.8 to 54.2%. However, the use of unlicensed food supplements (dose strength 400-50 000 IU) remained high, accounting for 39.7% of vitamin D prescriptions in 2018. The two licensed preparations showed mean (\u00b1SD) vitamin D content of 90.9 \u00b1 0.7% and 90.5 \u00b1 3.9% of the labelled claimed amount, meeting the British Pharmacopeia specification for licensed medicines (90-125% of labelled claim). The 11 food supplements showed vitamin D content ranging from 41.2 \u00b1 10.6% to 165.3 \u00b1 17.8% of the labelled claim, with eight of the preparations failing to comply with the food supplement specification (80-150% of labelled claim). Conclusions: Despite the increasing availability of quality assured licensed preparations, food supplements continued to be used interchangeably with licensed preparations to fulfil vitamin D prescriptions. Food supplements, manufactured under less stringent quality standards, showed wide variations between measured and declared vitamin D content, which could lead to the risk of under- and over-dosing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["drug utilisation", "pharmacy", "quality use of medicines"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089959822", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"55814329600": {"Name": "Wan M.", "AuthorID": "55814329600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, King's College London"}, "57218667621": {"Name": "Patel A.", "AuthorID": "57218667621", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, King's College London"}, "24597954500": {"Name": "Patel J.P.", "AuthorID": "24597954500", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematological Medicine, King's College Hospital Foundation NHS Trust"}, "9273470900": {"Name": "Jones S.", "AuthorID": "9273470900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, King's College London"}, "6602151058": {"Name": "Rait G.", "AuthorID": "6602151058", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University of College London"}, "22956754100": {"Name": "Shroff R.", "AuthorID": "22956754100", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Renal Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
