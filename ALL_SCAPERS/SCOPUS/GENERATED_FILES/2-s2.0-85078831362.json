V 2p, O 1s, C 1s, and valence band XPS spectra were collected as a function of relative humidity in a series of isotherm and isobar experiments. Experiments were carried out on two VO2 thin films on TiO2 (100) substrates, prepared with different surface cleaning procedures. Hydroxyl and molecular water surface species were identified, with up to 0.5 ML hydroxide present at the minimum relative humidity, and a consistent molecular water adsorption onset occurring around 0.01% relative humidity. The work function was found to increase with increasing relative humidity, suggesting that surface water and hydroxyl species are oriented with the hydrogen atoms directed away from the surface. Changes in the valence band were also observed as a function of relative humidity. The results were similar to those observed in APXPS experiments on other transition metal oxide surfaces, suggesting that H2O-OH and H2O-H2O surface complex formation plays an important role in the oxide wetting process and water dissociation. Compared to polycrystalline vanadium metal, these vanadium oxide films generate less hydroxide and appear to be more favorable for molecular water adsorption.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Ambient-pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopies", "Hydroxyl species", "Surface cleaning procedure", "Surface complex", "Vanadium oxide films", "Vanadium oxide thin films", "Water adsorption", "Water dissociation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078831362", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57199645289": {"Name": "Goodacre D.", "AuthorID": "57199645289", "AffiliationID": "60093471", "AffiliationName": "MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology"}, "6602762057": {"Name": "S\u00f6hnel T.", "AuthorID": "6602762057", "AffiliationID": "60093471", "AffiliationName": "MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology"}, "23468868700": {"Name": "Blum M.", "AuthorID": "23468868700", "AffiliationID": "60007174", "AffiliationName": "Chemical Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"}, "57200974084": {"Name": "Jovic V.", "AuthorID": "57200974084", "AffiliationID": "60019354", "AffiliationName": "National Isotope Center, GNS Science"}, "57210902562": {"Name": "Buechner C.", "AuthorID": "57210902562", "AffiliationID": "60007174", "AffiliationName": "Chemical Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"}, "57202251046": {"Name": "Hoek H.", "AuthorID": "57202251046", "AffiliationID": "60020599", "AffiliationName": "University of Twente"}, "57210901348": {"Name": "Gericke S.M.", "AuthorID": "57210901348", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Lund University"}, "7202890577": {"Name": "Franklin J.B.", "AuthorID": "7202890577", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "48761568000": {"Name": "Kittiwatanakul S.", "AuthorID": "48761568000", "AffiliationID": "60028190", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University"}, "56727849100": {"Name": "Bluhm H.", "AuthorID": "56727849100", "AffiliationID": "60008644", "AffiliationName": "Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck Society, Department of Inorganic Chemistry"}, "57201138498": {"Name": "Smith K.E.", "AuthorID": "57201138498", "AffiliationID": "60019674", "AffiliationName": "Boston University"}}}
