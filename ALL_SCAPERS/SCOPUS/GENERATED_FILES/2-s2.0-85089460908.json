Mutant HTT (mHTT) disrupts transcription, interferes with immune and mitochondrial function, and is aberrantly modified post-translationally. Evidence suggests that the mHTT RNA is toxic, and at the DNA level, somatic CAG repeat expansion in vulnerable cells influences the disease course. Genome-wide association studies have identified DNA repair pathways as modifiers of somatic instability and disease course in HD and other repeat expansion diseases. In animal models of HD, nucleocytoplasmic transport is disrupted and its restoration is neuroprotective. Novel cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma biomarkers are among the earliest detectable changes in individuals with premanifest HD and have the sensitivity to detect therapeutic benefit. Therapeutically, the first human trial of an HTT-lowering antisense oligonucleotide successfully, and safely, reduced the CSF concentration of mHTT in individuals with HD. A larger trial, powered to detect clinical efficacy, is underway, along with trials of other HTT-lowering approaches. In this Review, we discuss new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of HD and future therapeutic strategies, including the modulation of DNA repair and targeting the DNA mutation itself.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089460908", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"7006745684": {"Name": "Tabrizi S.J.", "AuthorID": "7006745684", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute, University College London"}, "57197965035": {"Name": "Flower M.D.", "AuthorID": "57197965035", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute, University College London"}, "57206324805": {"Name": "Wild E.J.", "AuthorID": "57206324805", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "8075002800": {"Name": "Ross C.A.", "AuthorID": "8075002800", "AffiliationID": "60001117", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Neurology, Neuroscience and Pharmacology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"}}}
