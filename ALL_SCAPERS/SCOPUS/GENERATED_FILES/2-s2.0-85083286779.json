There are three systematic influencing parameters identified in this study: socioeconomic development, population density, and annual mean temperature. The thermal comfort neutral temperatures predicted with the new model are in good agreement with the measured field data, and the correlation coefficient is 0.91. The current study introduces large-scale spatial data and longitudinal health-temperature data from the public health field for contributing to thermal comfort research. For instance, the required numbers of intensive field experiments and modeling works regarding thermal comfort can be reduced. Moreover, studies on the impacts of certain factors (such as variations in time, gender, and age) on thermal comfort have not reached any conclusive results, mainly owing to a lack of large demographic datasets. Recent findings from the public health field indicate that there are observable variations in health-temperature data in response to climate changes. There are no significant health-temperature differences between genders, although females are more inclined to use resources for better environmental management. Other factors are also discussed in this study, such as age and the prevalence of air conditioners.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Climate change", "Public health", "Systematic influencing parameters", "Thermal comfort"], "IndexKeywords": ["Annual mean temperatures", "Correlation coefficient", "Influencing parameters", "Neutral temperature", "Population densities", "Socio-economic development", "Temperature differences", "Thermal comfort models"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083286779", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"]], "AuthorData": {"36065463100": {"Name": "Jiang Y.", "AuthorID": "36065463100", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "XIN Center, Tsinghua University"}, "56176432100": {"Name": "Wang Z.", "AuthorID": "56176432100", "AffiliationID": "60007174", "AffiliationName": "Building Technology and Urban Systems Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"}, "57203508765": {"Name": "Lin B.", "AuthorID": "57203508765", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Building Science, School of Architecture, Tsinghua University"}, "14040664500": {"Name": "Mumovic D.", "AuthorID": "14040664500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering, University of College London"}}}
