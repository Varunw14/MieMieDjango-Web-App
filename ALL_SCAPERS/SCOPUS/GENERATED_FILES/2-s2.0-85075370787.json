Our analysis suggests that at least one billion people live in places that would be protected if the Half Earth proposal were implemented within all ecoregions. Taking into account the social and economic impacts of such proposals is central to addressing social and environmental justice concerns, and assessing their acceptability and feasibility.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biodiversity loss", "Ecoregions", "Social and economic impacts", "Social and environmental"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075370787", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Food Science", "AGRI", "1106"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"], ["Nature and Landscape Conservation", "ENVI", "2309"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"7005088726": {"Name": "Schleicher J.", "AuthorID": "7005088726", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University of Cambridge"}, "56784239400": {"Name": "Zaehringer J.", "AuthorID": "56784239400", "AffiliationID": "60020486", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Development and Environment, University of Bern"}, "6505901586": {"Name": "Vira B.", "AuthorID": "6505901586", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University of Cambridge"}, "15760838600": {"Name": "Sandbrook C.", "AuthorID": "15760838600", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University of Cambridge"}, "57210274001": {"Name": "Fastr\u00e9 C.", "AuthorID": "57210274001", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "26647965400": {"Name": "Visconti P.", "AuthorID": "26647965400", "AffiliationID": "60019497", "AffiliationName": "International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis"}}}
