They can arise due to dysfunction of the cerebellum, the vestibular system and/or the sensory neurons. Genetic defects are a common cause of chronic ataxia, particularly common are repeat expansions in this group of conditions. Co-occurrence of cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome has been termed CANVAS. Although CANVAS is a rare syndrome, on discovery of biallelic expansions in the second intron of replication factor C subunit 1 (RFC1) gene, we and others have found the phenotype is broad and RFC1 expansions are a common cause of late-onset progressive ataxia. We aim to provide a review and update on recent developments in CANVAS and populations, where the disorder has been reported. We have also optimised a protocol for RFC1 expansion screening which is described herein and expanded phenotype after analysing late-onset ataxia patients from around the world.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CANVAS", "Late-onset ataxia", "Repeat expansion", "RFC1", "Southern blot"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090798333", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57216317636": {"Name": "Dominik N.", "AuthorID": "57216317636", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuromuscular Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57216878196": {"Name": "Galassi Deforie V.", "AuthorID": "57216878196", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuromuscular Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57185293700": {"Name": "Cortese A.", "AuthorID": "57185293700", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain and Behavioural Sciences, University of Pavia"}, "7003363686": {"Name": "Houlden H.", "AuthorID": "7003363686", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuromuscular Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
