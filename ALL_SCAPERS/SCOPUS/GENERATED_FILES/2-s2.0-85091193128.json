This study investigated the presence of NfL in the vitreous humor and its associations with amyloid beta, tau, inflammatory cytokines and vascular proteins, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, systemic disease, and ophthalmic diseases. Methods: This is a single-site, prospective, cross-sectional cohort study. Undiluted vitreous fluid (0.5-1.0 mL) was aspirated during vitrectomy, and whole blood was drawn for APOE genotyping. NfL, amyloid beta (A\u03b2), total Tau (t-Tau), phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau181), inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and vascular proteins in the vitreous were quantitatively measured by immunoassay. The main outcome measures were the detection of NfL levels in the vitreous humor and its associations with the aforementioned proteins. Linear regression was used to test the associations of NfL with other proteins, APOE genotypes, MMSE scores, and ophthalmic and systemic diseases after adjustment for age, sex, education level, and other eye diseases. Results: NfL was detected in all 77 vitreous samples. NfL was not found to be associated with ophthalmic conditions, APOE genotypes, MMSE scores, or systemic disease (p > 0.05). NfL levels were positively associated with increased vitreous levels of A\u03b240 (p = 7.7 \u00d7 10-5), A\u03b242 (p = 2.8 \u00d7 10-4), and t-tau (p = 5.5 \u00d7 10-7), but not with p-tau181 (p = 0.53). NfL also had significant associations with inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-15 (IL-15, p = 5.3 \u00d7 10-4), IL-16 (p = 2.2 \u00d7 10-4), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1, p = 4.1 \u00d7 10-4), and vascular proteins such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR1, p = 2.9 \u00d7 10-6), Vegf-C (p = 8.6 \u00d7 10-6), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1, p = 5.0 \u00d7 10-4), Tie-2 (p = 6.3 \u00d7 10-4), and intracellular adhesion molecular-1 (ICAM-1, p = 1.6 \u00d7 10-4). Conclusion: NfL is detectable in the vitreous humor of the eye and significantly associated with amyloid beta, t-tau, and select inflammatory and vascular proteins in the vitreous. Additionally, NfL was not associated with patients' clinical eye condition. Our results serve as a foundation for further investigation of NfL in the ocular fluids to inform us about the potential utility of its presence in the eye.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Amyloid beta", "Neuro-filament light chain", "Ocular biomarkers", "Tau", "Vitreous humor"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091193128", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"7103044060": {"Name": "Subramanian M.L.", "AuthorID": "7103044060", "AffiliationID": "60003526, 60006385", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Boston Medical Center, Boston University School of Medicine"}, "57219084257": {"Name": "Vig V.", "AuthorID": "57219084257", "AffiliationID": "60003526, 60006385", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Boston Medical Center, Boston University School of Medicine"}, "57208468501": {"Name": "Fiorello M.G.", "AuthorID": "57208468501", "AffiliationID": "60003526, 60006385", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Boston Medical Center, Boston University School of Medicine"}, "54895231500": {"Name": "Siegel N.H.", "AuthorID": "54895231500", "AffiliationID": "60003526, 60006385", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Boston Medical Center, Boston University School of Medicine"}, "8688875100": {"Name": "Ness S.", "AuthorID": "8688875100", "AffiliationID": "60003526, 60006385", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Boston Medical Center, Boston University School of Medicine"}, "55470448500": {"Name": "Chung J.", "AuthorID": "55470448500", "AffiliationID": "60006385", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Biomedical Genetics Section, Boston University School of Medicine"}, "57207904142": {"Name": "Jun G.R.", "AuthorID": "57207904142", "AffiliationID": "60006385", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Biomedical Genetics Section, Boston University School of Medicine"}, "7102122565": {"Name": "Xia W.", "AuthorID": "7102122565", "AffiliationID": "60014232", "AffiliationName": "Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, Bedford Veterans Affairs Medical Center"}, "57208899083": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "57208899083", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL"}, "7101909602": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "7101909602", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "6506898631": {"Name": "Zetterberg M.", "AuthorID": "6506898631", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "57189027901": {"Name": "Shareef F.", "AuthorID": "57189027901", "AffiliationID": "60023868", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of Illinois at Chicago School of Medicine"}, "55221221800": {"Name": "Stein T.D.", "AuthorID": "55221221800", "AffiliationID": "60014232, 60105918", "AffiliationName": "Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, VA Boston Healthcare System"}}}
