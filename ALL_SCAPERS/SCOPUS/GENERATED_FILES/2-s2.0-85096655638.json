The International Journal of Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Background: Full-procedure virtual reality (VR) simulator training in robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) is a new tool in surgical education. Methods: Description of the development of a VR RARP simulation model, (RobotiX-Mentor\u00ae) including non-guided bladder neck (ngBND) and neurovascular bundle dissection (ngNVBD) modules, and assessment of face, content, and construct validation of the ngBND and ngNVBD modules by robotic surgeons with different experience levels. Results: Simulator and ngBND/ngNVBD modules were rated highly by all surgeons for realism and usability as training tool. In the ngBND-task construct, validation was not achieved in task-specific performance metrics. In the ngNVBD, task-specific performance of the expert/intermediately experienced surgeons was significantly better than that of novices. Conclusions: We proved face and content validity of simulator and both modules, and construct validity for generic metrics of the ngBND module and for generic and task-specific metrics of the ngNVBD module.", "AuthorKeywords": ["education", "prostate", "robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy", "simulator", "training", "validation", "virtual reality"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096655638", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"25653800300": {"Name": "Ebbing J.", "AuthorID": "25653800300", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Karolinska University Hospital, Department of Urology"}, "57200326667": {"Name": "Heimer M.", "AuthorID": "57200326667", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Charit\u00e9 \u2013 University Hospital, Medical Department, Division of Nephrology"}, "35303958500": {"Name": "Wiklund P.N.", "AuthorID": "35303958500", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Department of Urology"}, "6602199428": {"Name": "Akre O.", "AuthorID": "6602199428", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Karolinska Institutet, Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery (MMK)"}, "8523702300": {"Name": "Carlsson S.", "AuthorID": "8523702300", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Karolinska Institutet, Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery (MMK)"}, "57203237538": {"Name": "Olsson M.J.", "AuthorID": "57203237538", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Karolinska University Hospital, Department of Urology"}, "7404950765": {"Name": "Collins J.W.", "AuthorID": "7404950765", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital"}, "56446908700": {"Name": "H\u00f6ijer J.", "AuthorID": "56446908700", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Karolinska Institutet, Unit of Biostatistics, Institute of Environmental Medicine (IMM)"}}}
