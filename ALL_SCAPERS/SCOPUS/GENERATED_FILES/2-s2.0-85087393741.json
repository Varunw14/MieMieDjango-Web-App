Method In total, 5360 participants with data on personality, neurological functioning, maternal smoking during pregnancy, education and occupation, physical exercise, adult self-reported BMI and obesity were included in the study. Obesity at 55 years was the outcome variable. Results The rates of obesity increased from 9.5 to 22.8% from age 33 to 55 years. Logistic regression analyses (adjusted estimates) showed that childhood neurological functioning (OR = 1.32: 1.07\u20131.63, P < 0.01), maternal smoking during pregnancy (OR = 1.42: 1.22\u20131.65, P < 0.001), educational qualifications (OR = 0.54: 0.37\u20130.79, P < 0.01), trait conscientiousness (OR = 0.80:0.74\u20130.86, P < 0.001) and physical exercise (OR = 0.87: 0.82\u20130.92, P < 0.001) were significant predictors of obesity at age 55 years for both men and women. Trait extraversion for men (OR = 1.16: 1.07\u20131.26, P < 0.001) and trait emotional stability for women (OR = 0.90: 0.82\u20130.99, P < 0.05) were also significant predictors of the outcome variable. Conclusion Biomedical, psychological, environmental and behavioural factors were all associated with adult obesity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Childhood neurological conditions", "Longitudinal", "Maternal smoking", "Obesity", "Personality traits", "Physical exercise"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087393741", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"55326183500": {"Name": "Cheng H.", "AuthorID": "55326183500", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "ESRC Centre for Learning and Life Chances in Knowledge Economies and Societies, Institute of Education, University College London"}, "36045985300": {"Name": "Furnham A.", "AuthorID": "36045985300", "AffiliationID": "60007996", "AffiliationName": "BI: Norwegian Business School"}, "56820589000": {"Name": "Green A.", "AuthorID": "56820589000", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "ESRC Centre for Learning and Life Chances in Knowledge Economies and Societies, Institute of Education, University College London"}, "57203048203": {"Name": "Montgomery S.", "AuthorID": "57203048203", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Epidemiology Unit, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet"}}}
