Methods: Split-detector AOSLO images of the foveal cone mosaic were acquired from both eyes of 26 subjects (mean age 24.3 years; range 8\u201344 years, 14 females) with genetically confirmed CNGA3- or CNGB3-associated ACHM. Cones were identified within a manually delineated rod-free zone. Peak cone density (PCD) was determined using an 80 \u00d7 80 \u03bcm sampling window within the rod-free zone. The mean and standard deviation (SD) of inter-cell distance (ICD) were calculated to derive the coefficient of variation (CV). Cone density difference maps were generated to compare cone topography between eyes. Results: PCD (mean \u00b1 SD) was 17,530 \u00b1 9,614 cones/mm2 and 17,638 \u00b1 9,753 cones/mm2 for right and left eyes, respectively (p = .677, Wilcoxon test). The mean (\u00b1 SD) for ICD was 9.05 \u00b1 2.55 \u00b5m and 9.24 \u00b1 2.55 \u00b5m for right and left eyes, respectively (p = .410, paired t-test). The mean (\u00b1 SD) for CV of ICD was 0.16 \u00b1 0.03 \u00b5m and 0.16 \u00b1 0.04 \u00b5m for right and left eyes, respectively (p = .562, paired t-test). Cone density maps demonstrated that cone topography of the ACHM fovea is non-uniform with local variations in cone density between eyes. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the interocular symmetry of the foveal cone mosaic (both density and packing) in ACHM. As cone topography can differ between eyes of a subject, PCD does not completely describe the foveal cone mosaic in ACHM. Nonetheless, these findings are of value in longitudinal monitoring of patients during treatment trials and further suggest that both eyes of a given subject may have similar therapeutic potential and non-study eye can be used as a control.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Achromatopsia", "cone photoreceptors", "fovea", "interocular symmetry", "retinal imaging"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081741600", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"56503899900": {"Name": "Litts K.M.", "AuthorID": "56503899900", "AffiliationID": "60012553", "AffiliationName": "Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences, Medical College of Wisconsin"}, "57190489812": {"Name": "Patterson E.J.", "AuthorID": "57190489812", "AffiliationID": "60012553", "AffiliationName": "Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences, Medical College of Wisconsin"}, "57209748679": {"Name": "Mastey R.R.", "AuthorID": "57209748679", "AffiliationID": "60012553", "AffiliationName": "Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences, Medical College of Wisconsin"}, "7402034918": {"Name": "Carroll J.", "AuthorID": "7402034918", "AffiliationID": "60012553", "AffiliationName": "Cell Biology, Neurobiology and Anatomy, Medical College of Wisconsin"}, "57200827164": {"Name": "Georgiou M.", "AuthorID": "57200827164", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "36490013200": {"Name": "Kalitzeos A.", "AuthorID": "36490013200", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57202482672": {"Name": "Michaelides M.", "AuthorID": "57202482672", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "55179422700": {"Name": "Langlo C.S.", "AuthorID": "55179422700", "AffiliationID": "60012553", "AffiliationName": "Cell Biology, Neurobiology and Anatomy, Medical College of Wisconsin"}, "57195948095": {"Name": "Linderman R.E.", "AuthorID": "57195948095", "AffiliationID": "60012553", "AffiliationName": "Cell Biology, Neurobiology and Anatomy, Medical College of Wisconsin"}, "7102023617": {"Name": "Lam B.L.", "AuthorID": "7102023617", "AffiliationID": "60016686, 60029251", "AffiliationName": "Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, University of Miami"}, "57203917402": {"Name": "Fishman G.A.", "AuthorID": "57203917402", "AffiliationID": "112584768", "AffiliationName": "Pangere Center for Inherited Retinal Diseases, The Chicago Lighthouse"}, "7003510165": {"Name": "Pennesi M.E.", "AuthorID": "7003510165", "AffiliationID": "60016733", "AffiliationName": "Casey Eye Institute, Oregon Health & Science University"}, "34978663500": {"Name": "Kay C.N.", "AuthorID": "34978663500", "AffiliationID": "120820800", "AffiliationName": "Vitreoretinal Associates"}, "7005825295": {"Name": "Hauswirth W.W.", "AuthorID": "7005825295", "AffiliationID": "60013959", "AffiliationName": "Ophthalmology, University of Florida"}}}
