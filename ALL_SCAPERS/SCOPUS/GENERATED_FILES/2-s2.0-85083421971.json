The NADH:[NAD+ + NADH] (redox) ratio in sickle red blood cells (RBCs) is lower than in normal RBCs, consistent with oxidative stress, therefore glutamine availability is important in sickle cell disease (SCD). RBC glutamine levels vary between SCD studies but the ratio glutamine:glutamate was inversely related to tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity in one. Oral l-glutamine was associated with an increase in NADH and reduction in RBC endothelium adhesion in small studies of SCD patients. In a sickle mouse model, glutamine levels were directly related to cerebral blood flow. Phase II and III randomized, double-blind, controlled trials of l-glutamine 0.6 g/kg/day compared with placebo in children and adults with SCD and \u2265 2 episodes of pain in the previous year provide evidence that l-glutamine is safe and associated with a reduction in painful episodes and in hospitalizations. However, l-glutamine was only tolerated in two-thirds of patients, anemia and hemolysis did not improve and there are few data on mortality and organ complications. Future studies should investigate the effect of other amino acids and total protein intake.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amino acids", "Blood disorders", "Hematologic agents", "l-Glutamine", "Sickle cell disease"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anemia, Sickle Cell", "Animals", "Child", "Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic", "Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic", "Double-Blind Method", "Erythrocytes", "Glutamine", "Humans", "Mice", "NAD", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083421971", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"9943207000": {"Name": "Cox S.E.", "AuthorID": "9943207000", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57216413648": {"Name": "Hart E.", "AuthorID": "57216413648", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical School, University College London"}, "26643012600": {"Name": "Kirkham F.J.", "AuthorID": "26643012600", "AffiliationID": "60025225, 60000703", "AffiliationName": "University of Southampton, University Hospital Southampton"}, "57196455905": {"Name": "Stotesbury H.", "AuthorID": "57196455905", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neurosciences, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}}}
