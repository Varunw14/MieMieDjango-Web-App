No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ.Genetic and acquired disorders of white matter comprise a diverse group of conditions, with often overlapping clinical and radiological findings. Patients present with a variable combination of cognitive impairment, ataxia, spasticity or movement disorders, among others. There are many genetic causes, and the route to diagnosis involves comprehensive clinical assessment, radiological expertise, metabolic investigations and finally genetic studies. It is essential not to miss the treatable acquired causes. In this review, we present a practical approach to investigating patients with acquired and genetic disorders of white matter, based on the experience of a large international referral centre. We present a guide for clinicians, including pitfalls of testing, clinical pearls and where to seek advice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ADRENOLEUKODYSTROPHY", "ALZHEIMERS DISEASE", "CLINICAL NEUROLOGY", "DEMENTIA", "EPILEPSY", "GENETICS", "METABOLIC DISEASE", "MRI", "MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS", "NEUROGENETICS", "NEURORADIOLOGY"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088881819", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57189267630": {"Name": "Williams T.", "AuthorID": "57189267630", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Queen Square Ms Centre, Department of Neuroinflammation, Ucl Institute of Neurology"}, "57203840825": {"Name": "John N.", "AuthorID": "57203840825", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Queen Square Ms Centre, Department of Neuroinflammation, Ucl Institute of Neurology"}, "57212501583": {"Name": "Chataway J.", "AuthorID": "57212501583", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Queen Square Ms Centre, Department of Neuroinflammation, Ucl Institute of Neurology"}, "7003363686": {"Name": "Houlden H.", "AuthorID": "7003363686", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuromuscular Disease, Ucl Institute of Neurology and the National, Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "56666751600": {"Name": "Lynch D.S.", "AuthorID": "56666751600", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuromuscular Disease, Ucl Institute of Neurology and the National, Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "56497461300": {"Name": "Murphy E.", "AuthorID": "56497461300", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Charles Dent Metabolic Unit, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7201444328": {"Name": "Fox N.C.", "AuthorID": "7201444328", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, University College London, Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "57213315348": {"Name": "Schott J.M.", "AuthorID": "57213315348", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, University College London, Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "55257174500": {"Name": "Adams M.", "AuthorID": "55257174500", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Lysholm Department of Neuroradiology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57218346369": {"Name": "Davagananam I.", "AuthorID": "57218346369", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation (ID), Ucl Institute of Neurology"}}}
