The technique enhances the performance of a continuous-wave THz spectrometer to reveal previously inaccessible details of closely spaced spectral peaks. We demonstrate the technique by performing spectroscopy on LiYF4:Ho3+, a material of interest for quantum science and technology, where we discriminate between inhomogeneous Gaussian and homogeneous Lorentzian contributions to absorption lines near 0.2 THz. Ultra-high-resolution (<100 Hz full-width at half maximum) frequency-domain spectroscopy with quality factor Q > 2 \u00d7 109 is achieved using an exact frequency spacing comb source in the optical communications band, with a custom uni-traveling-carrier photodiode mixer and coherent down-conversion detection. Software-defined time-domain modulation of one of the comb lines is demonstrated and used to resolve the sample SLS and to obtain a magnetic field-free readout of the electronuclear spectrum for the Ho3+ ions in LiYF4:Ho3+. In particular, homogeneous and inhomogeneous contributions to the spectrum are readily separated. The experiment reveals previously unmeasured information regarding the hyperfine structure of the first excited state in the 5 I8 manifold complementing the results reported in Phys. Rev. B 94, 205132 (2016).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Continuous-wave thz", "First excited state", "Frequency domain spectroscopy", "Science and Technology", "Spectral line shape", "Time domain modulation", "Ultrahigh resolution", "Uni-traveling carrier photodiode"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096035399", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"12807640500": {"Name": "Hermans R.I.", "AuthorID": "12807640500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57195396618": {"Name": "Seddon J.", "AuthorID": "57195396618", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55600338800": {"Name": "Shams H.", "AuthorID": "55600338800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "8276654100": {"Name": "Ponnampalam L.", "AuthorID": "8276654100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004751445": {"Name": "Seeds A.J.", "AuthorID": "7004751445", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005272488": {"Name": "Aeppli G.", "AuthorID": "7005272488", "AffiliationID": "60020195", "AffiliationName": "Photon Science Division, Paul Scherrer Institute"}}}
