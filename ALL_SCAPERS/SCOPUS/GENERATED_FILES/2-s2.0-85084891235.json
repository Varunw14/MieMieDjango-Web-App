This chapter seeks to clarify what kinds of government policies on small and intermediate urban centres could increase the proportion of the national population with access to publicly provided social and physical services and with a more adequate and stable livelihood. It considers the extent to which special government policies on small and intermediate urban centres might contribute to other commonly stated spatial aims - such as slowing migration to major cities or existing concentrations of industry, or improving service provision to rural populations, or achieving \u2018better regional balance\u2019.
