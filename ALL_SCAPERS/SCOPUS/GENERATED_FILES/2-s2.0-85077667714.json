Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.VDJbase is a publicly available database that offers easy searching of data describing the complete sets of gene sequences (genotypes and haplotypes) inferred from adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing datasets. VDJbase is designed to act as a resource that will allow the scientific community to explore the genetic variability of the immunoglobulin (Ig) and T cell receptor (TR) gene loci. It can also assist in the investigation of Ig- A nd TR-related genetic predispositions to diseases. Our database includes web-based query and online tools to assist in visualization and analysis of the genotype and haplotype data. It enables users to detect those alleles and genes that are significantly over-represented in a particular population, in terms of genotype, haplotype and gene expression. The database website can be freely accessed at https://www.vdjbase.org/, and no login is required. The data and code use creative common licenses and are freely downloadable from https://bitbucket.org/account/user/yaarilab/projects/GPHP.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Computational Biology", "Databases, Genetic", "Genotype", "Haplotypes", "Humans", "Molecular Sequence Annotation", "Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell", "Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell", "Receptors, Immunologic", "Software", "Software Design", "V(D)J Recombination", "Web Browser", "Workflow"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077667714", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"57215313929": {"Name": "Omer A.", "AuthorID": "57215313929", "AffiliationID": "60002765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering, Faculty of Engineering, Bar-Ilan University"}, "57215329774": {"Name": "Shemesh O.", "AuthorID": "57215329774", "AffiliationID": "60002765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering, Faculty of Engineering, Bar-Ilan University"}, "57205715291": {"Name": "Peres A.", "AuthorID": "57205715291", "AffiliationID": "60002765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering, Faculty of Engineering, Bar-Ilan University"}, "24174727600": {"Name": "Polak P.", "AuthorID": "24174727600", "AffiliationID": "60002765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering, Faculty of Engineering, Bar-Ilan University"}, "9839244400": {"Name": "Yaari G.", "AuthorID": "9839244400", "AffiliationID": "60002765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering, Faculty of Engineering, Bar-Ilan University"}, "36118495000": {"Name": "Shepherd A.J.", "AuthorID": "36118495000", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "36138581400": {"Name": "Lees W.", "AuthorID": "36138581400", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "35847877700": {"Name": "Watson C.T.", "AuthorID": "35847877700", "AffiliationID": "60022286", "AffiliationName": "University of Louisville School of Medicine, Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics"}, "23099409200": {"Name": "Boyd S.D.", "AuthorID": "23099409200", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Stanford University"}, "7403186390": {"Name": "Collins A.M.", "AuthorID": "7403186390", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of NSW"}}}
