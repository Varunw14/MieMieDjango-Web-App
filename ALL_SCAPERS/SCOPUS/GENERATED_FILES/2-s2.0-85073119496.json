However, the association of these markers of neurodegeneration and AD pathology with neuroinflammation has not been investigated previously. Therefore, the current study examined whether NFL and A\u03b2 correlate with KP metabolites in elderly individuals to provide insight on the association between blood indicators of neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. Methods: Correlations between KP metabolites, measured using liquid chromatography and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, and plasma NFL and A\u03b2 concentrations, measured using single molecule array (Simoa) assays, were investigated in elderly individuals aged 65-90 years, with normal global cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination Score \u2265 26) from the Kerr Anglican Retirement Village Initiative in Ageing Health cohort. Results: A positive correlation between NFL and the kynurenine to tryptophan ratio (K/T) reflecting indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity was observed (r =.451, p <.0001). Positive correlations were also observed between NFL and kynurenine (r =.364, p <.0005), kynurenic acid (r =.384, p <.0001), 3-hydroxykynurenine (r =.246, p =.014), anthranilic acid (r =.311, p =.002), and quinolinic acid (r =.296, p =.003). Further, significant associations were observed between plasma A\u03b240 and the K/T (r =.375, p <.0005), kynurenine (r =.374, p <.0005), kynurenic acid (r =.352, p <.0005), anthranilic acid (r =.381, p <.0005), and quinolinic acid (r =.352, p <.0005). Significant associations were also observed between plasma A\u03b242 and the K/T ratio (r =.215, p =.034), kynurenic acid (r =.214, p =.035), anthranilic acid (r =.278, p =.006), and quinolinic acid (r =.224, p =.027) in the cohort. On stratifying participants based on their neocortical A\u03b2 load (NAL) status, NFL correlated with KP metabolites irrespective of NAL status; however, associations between plasma A\u03b2 and KP metabolites were only pronounced in individuals with high NAL while associations in individuals with low NAL were nearly absent. Conclusions: The current study shows that KP metabolite changes are associated with biomarker evidence of neurodegeneration. Additionally, the association between KP metabolites and plasma A\u03b2 seems to be NAL status dependent. Finally, the current study suggests that an association between neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation manifests in the periphery, suggesting that preventing cytoskeleton cytotoxicity by KP metabolites may have therapeutic potential.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Amyloid-beta", "Blood amyloid-beta", "Blood markers", "Brain amyloid-beta", "Kynurenine pathway", "Neurodegeneration", "Neurofilament light chain", "Neuroinflammation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Biomarkers", "Female", "Humans", "Kynurenine", "Male", "Neurofilament Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073119496", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"56712359300": {"Name": "Chatterjee P.", "AuthorID": "56712359300", "AffiliationID": "60105210", "AffiliationName": "School of Medical Health and Sciences, Edith Cowan University"}, "56653535300": {"Name": "Goozee K.", "AuthorID": "56653535300", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences, University of Western Australia"}, "14012309600": {"Name": "Lim C.K.", "AuthorID": "14012309600", "AffiliationID": "60019544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, Macquarie University"}, "57188587251": {"Name": "Jacobs K.R.", "AuthorID": "57188587251", "AffiliationID": "60019544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, Macquarie University"}, "24282122200": {"Name": "Sohrabi H.R.", "AuthorID": "24282122200", "AffiliationID": "118881790", "AffiliationName": "Australian Alzheimer's Research Foundation"}, "56545160500": {"Name": "Shah T.", "AuthorID": "56545160500", "AffiliationID": "118881790", "AffiliationName": "Australian Alzheimer's Research Foundation"}, "56671228700": {"Name": "Asih P.R.", "AuthorID": "56671228700", "AffiliationID": "60019544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, Macquarie University"}, "57202290892": {"Name": "Dave P.", "AuthorID": "57202290892", "AffiliationID": "122112172", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research Department, Anglicare"}, "57074532700": {"Name": "Lovejoy D.B.", "AuthorID": "57074532700", "AffiliationID": "60019544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, Macquarie University"}, "7006315967": {"Name": "Guillemin G.J.", "AuthorID": "7006315967", "AffiliationID": "60019544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, Macquarie University"}, "35402269600": {"Name": "Martins R.N.", "AuthorID": "35402269600", "AffiliationID": "60105210", "AffiliationName": "School of Medical and Health Sciences, Edith Cowan University, Ralph and Patricia Sarich Neuroscience Research Institute"}, "6602229025": {"Name": "Pedrini S.", "AuthorID": "6602229025", "AffiliationID": "60105210", "AffiliationName": "School of Medical Health and Sciences, Edith Cowan University"}, "6602812707": {"Name": "Taddei K.", "AuthorID": "6602812707", "AffiliationID": "118881790", "AffiliationName": "Australian Alzheimer's Research Foundation"}, "57208899083": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "57208899083", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL"}, "55498735800": {"Name": "Ashton N.J.", "AuthorID": "55498735800", "AffiliationID": "60046006, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Wallenberg Centre for Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Gothenburg"}, "7101909602": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "7101909602", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "6603434972": {"Name": "Hye A.", "AuthorID": "6603434972", "AffiliationID": "60028884, 60171762", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Mental Health, Biomedical Research Unit for Dementia, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation"}, "40762139200": {"Name": "Shen K.", "AuthorID": "40762139200", "AffiliationID": "60029470", "AffiliationName": "Australian EHealth Research Centre, CSIRO"}}}
