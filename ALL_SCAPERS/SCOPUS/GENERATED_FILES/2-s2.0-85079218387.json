This article is available under a Creative Commons License (Attribution 4.0 International, as described at https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).Memory and learning involve activity-driven expression of proteins and cytoskeletal reorganization at new synapses, requiring posttranscriptional regulation of localized mRNA a long distance from corresponding nuclei. A key factor expressed early in synapse formation is Msp300/Nesprin-1, which organizes actin filaments around the new synapse. How Msp300 expression is regulated during synaptic plasticity is poorly understood. Here, we show that activity-dependent accumulation of Msp300 in the postsynaptic compartment of the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction is regulated by the conserved RNA binding protein Syncrip/hnRNP Q. Syncrip (Syp) binds to msp300 transcripts and is essential for plasticity. Single-molecule imaging shows that msp300 is associated with Syp in vivo and forms ribosome-rich granules that contain the translation factor eIF4E. Elevated neural activity alters the dynamics of Syp and the number of msp300:Syp:eIF4E RNP granules at the synapse, suggesting that these particles facilitate translation. These results introduce Syp as an important early acting activity-dependent regulator of a plasticity gene that is strongly associated with human ataxias.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Animals, Genetically Modified", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Drosophila Proteins", "Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Microfilament Proteins", "Muscle Proteins", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Neuromuscular Junction", "Neuronal Plasticity", "RNA-Binding Proteins", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079218387", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"55908939900": {"Name": "Titlow J.", "AuthorID": "55908939900", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford"}, "57200838916": {"Name": "Robertson F.", "AuthorID": "57200838916", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford"}, "37561437500": {"Name": "J\u00e4rvelin A.", "AuthorID": "37561437500", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford"}, "7004283036": {"Name": "Ish-Horowicz D.", "AuthorID": "7004283036", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Lab for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "56209473900": {"Name": "Davis I.", "AuthorID": "56209473900", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford"}, "36093197100": {"Name": "Smith C.", "AuthorID": "36093197100", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour, University of Oxford"}, "26642991900": {"Name": "Gratton E.", "AuthorID": "26642991900", "AffiliationID": "60007278", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics, University of California Irvine"}}}
