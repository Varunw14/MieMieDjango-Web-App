All rights reserved.In this chapter, we summarize the optical absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy of metal-halide perovskite semiconductors that are substantially important to understand their behavior in optoelectronic devices and estimate their performance limits. First, we introduce the most common methods to measure the optical absorption of perovskite materials and their limitations followed by the common methods of extracting optical bandgap. Then, we discuss the near bandgap states, the process of light absorption and exciton generation in metal-halide perovskites as well as tuning the optical bandgap of them via chemical modifications. Second, we explain the PL spectroscopy of perovskites and the process involved in it alongside the main extracted parameters including diffusion lengths and carrier lifetime. We also discuss the concept of photon recycling in halide perovskite as well as the exciton binding energy and excitonic peaks in PL. Furthermore, we show effective strategies to tune and stabilize the PL in metal-halide perovskite as well as the impact of crystallinity and charge extraction layers on the PL. Finally, we show the temperature dependency of PL in metal-halide perovskites.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bandgap/emission tunability", "Optical absorption", "Optical bandgap", "Photoluminescence spectra", "Photoluminescent stability"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85093494489", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"55864987800": {"Name": "Abdi-Jalebi M.", "AuthorID": "55864987800", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Cambridge"}, "55906590900": {"Name": "Sadhanala A.", "AuthorID": "55906590900", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Cambridge"}, "56105156500": {"Name": "Ibrahim Dar M.", "AuthorID": "56105156500", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Photonics and Interfaces, Institute of Chemical Sciences and Engineering, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"}, "10046404400": {"Name": "Johansson E.M.J.", "AuthorID": "10046404400", "AffiliationID": "60023238, 60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m laboratory, Uppsala University"}, "52364747000": {"Name": "Pazoki M.", "AuthorID": "52364747000", "AffiliationID": "60023238, 60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Sciences, Solid State Physics, \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m laboratory, Uppsala University"}}}
