Ten years later, there is still a pressing need for cultural and materialist criticism of the politics of production within game studies. In putting together this special issue, our hope is to identify new developments in the game industry and academia that are emblematic of 21st-century capitalism. Just as Games of Empire popularised critical political-economic perspectives ten years ago, we encourage others, as the authors in this issue did, to continue and maintain investigations into questions of ownership, privatized property, coercive class relations, military operations and radical struggle. Such analyses are necessary not only to trace but also to open up new directions in game culture and academia for decades to come.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cultural industries", "Games of Empire", "political economy", "production studies", "videogames"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091382464", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"], ["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"]], "AuthorData": {"57192090421": {"Name": "Hammar E.L.", "AuthorID": "57192090421", "AffiliationID": "60021255", "AffiliationName": "Department of Language and Culture, University of Troms\u00f8"}, "57197770360": {"Name": "de Wildt L.", "AuthorID": "57197770360", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Media Studies, KU Leuven"}, "57131291000": {"Name": "Mukherjee S.", "AuthorID": "57131291000", "AffiliationID": "60023609", "AffiliationName": "Department of English, Presidency University"}, "57218922153": {"Name": "Pelletier C.", "AuthorID": "57218922153", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
