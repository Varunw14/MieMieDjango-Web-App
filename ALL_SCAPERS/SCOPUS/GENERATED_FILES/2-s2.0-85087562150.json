A thematic analysis of 20 semistructured interviews with women living in safe houses produced three main themes about the relationship between conflict and domestic violence: (a) violence from loss of patriarchal support, (b) violence from the drug trade as an economic driver, and (c) violence from conflict-related poverty. We discuss the bidirectional nature of this relationship: Not only does conflict contribute to domestic violence, but domestic violence contributes to conflict through justifying armed intervention, separating women from economic and public life, and perpetuating patriarchy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Afghanistan", "armed conflict", "domestic violence", "lived experience", "patriarchy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087562150", "SubjectAreas": [["Gender Studies", "SOCI", "3318"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"36146258600": {"Name": "Mannell J.", "AuthorID": "36146258600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Global Health"}, "57217738436": {"Name": "Grewal G.", "AuthorID": "57217738436", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Global Health"}, "55228578000": {"Name": "Ahmad A.", "AuthorID": "55228578000", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "St George\u2019s, University of London"}, "57190434735": {"Name": "Ahmad L.", "AuthorID": "57190434735", "AffiliationID": "119636848", "AffiliationName": "Independent Consultant"}}}
