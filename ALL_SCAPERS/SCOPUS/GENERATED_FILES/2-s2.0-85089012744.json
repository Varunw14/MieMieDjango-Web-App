This makes conceptions of populism elastic. This article asserts that a discourse should only qualify as populist if it constructs an elite that acts in its collective interests and possesses a majority of power across fields. These criteria narrow the definition of populism and reveals another type of discourse, christened here \u2018elitist plebeianism\u2019. While populists bifurcate society between \u2018the people\u2019 and \u2018the elite\u2019, elitist plebeians trifurcate society between \u2018the common people\u2019, \u2018the elite\u2019 and a middle stratum. While populists vilify the elite, elitist plebeians heroize it and vilify the middle. In office, populists struggle to reconcile their power and their opposition to the powerful; elitist plebeians do not. This similarity in terms and structure facilitates the movement between populist and elitist plebeian discourses. That makes elitist plebeianism a ready-made script for so-called \u2018populists in power.\u2019 Tanzania provides proof of concept. Tanzania\u2019s opposition constructed Chama cha Mapinduzi (CCM) as a corrupt establishment. Magufuli and his party appropriated this discourse but relocated corruption from the elite to the bureaucracy and business, which they portrayed as less powerful than themselves; their discourse is not populist, but elitist plebeian.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089012744", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"57192216181": {"Name": "Paget D.", "AuthorID": "57192216181", "AffiliationID": "60015875", "AffiliationName": "Department of Political Science, University of Aberdeen"}}}
