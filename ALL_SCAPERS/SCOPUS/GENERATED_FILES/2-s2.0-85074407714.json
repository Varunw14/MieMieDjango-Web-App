In this combined experimental and theoretical study, we reveal that a covalent dimer of the organic semiconductor tetracene undergoes activated singlet fission by qualitatively different mechanisms depending on the solvent environment. We show that intramolecular vibrations are an integral part of this mechanism, giving rise to mixing between charge transfer and triplet pair excitations. Either coherent or incoherent singlet fission can occur, depending on the transient solvent-induced energetic proximity between the states, giving rise to complex variation of the singlet fission mechanism and time scale in the different environments. Our results suggest a more general principle for controlling the efficiency of photochemical reactions by utilizing transient interactions to tune the energetics of reactant and product states and switch between incoherent and coherent dynamics.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Coherent dynamics", "Different mechanisms", "Intramolecular vibration", "Photovoltaic devices", "Solvent environments", "Symmetry-breaking", "Theoretical study", "Transient interactions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074407714", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Colloid and Surface Chemistry", "CENG", "1505"]], "AuthorData": {"57195401818": {"Name": "Alvertis A.M.", "AuthorID": "57195401818", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "55619838400": {"Name": "Hele T.J.H.", "AuthorID": "55619838400", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "7005346890": {"Name": "Greenham N.C.", "AuthorID": "7005346890", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "55979679700": {"Name": "Lukman S.", "AuthorID": "55979679700", "AffiliationID": "60030743, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, Agency for Science Technology and Research (A*STAR)"}, "57195200321": {"Name": "Fuemmeler E.G.", "AuthorID": "57195200321", "AffiliationID": "60007776", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell University"}, "36105657800": {"Name": "Musser A.J.", "AuthorID": "36105657800", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Sheffield"}, "55819869600": {"Name": "Feng J.", "AuthorID": "55819869600", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, National University of Singapore"}, "57204689735": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "57204689735", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, National University of Singapore"}, "20733377800": {"Name": "Chin A.W.", "AuthorID": "20733377800", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60008134, 60072952", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, Institut des NanoSciences de Paris, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9"}}}
