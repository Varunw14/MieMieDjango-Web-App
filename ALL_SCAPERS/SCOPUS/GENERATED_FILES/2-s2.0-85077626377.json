However, most educational resources are developed for adults. To address this gap in informational resources, we have co-designed, developed and evaluated an educational resource about genome sequencing for young people. The first animation explains what a genome is, genomic variation and genome sequencing (\u201cMy Genome Sequence\u201d: http://bit.ly/mygenomesequence), the second focuses on the limitations and uncertainties of genome sequencing (\u201cMy Genome Sequence part 2\u201d: http://bit.ly/mygenomesequence2). In total, 554 school pupils (11\u201315 years) took part in the quantitative evaluation. Mean objective knowledge increased from before to after watching one or both animations (4.24 vs 7.60 respectively; t = 32.16, p < 0.001). Self-rated awareness and understanding of the words \u2018genome\u2019 and \u2018genome sequencing\u2019 increased significantly after watching the animation. Most pupils felt they understood the benefits of sequencing after watching one (75.4%) or both animations (76.6%). Only 17.3% felt they understood the limitations and uncertainties after watching the first, however this was higher among those watching both (58.5%, p < 0.001). Twelve young people, 14 parents and 3 health professionals consenting in the 100,000 Genomes Project reported that the animation was clear and engaging, eased concerns about the process and empowered young people to take an active role in decision-making. To increase accessibility, subtitles in other languages could be added, and the script could be made available in a leaflet format for those that do not have internet access. Future research could focus on formally evaluating the animations in a clinical setting.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077626377", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"22135567300": {"Name": "Lewis C.", "AuthorID": "22135567300", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57213151558": {"Name": "Hammond J.", "AuthorID": "57213151558", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7404448261": {"Name": "Hill M.", "AuthorID": "7404448261", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7006741537": {"Name": "Chitty L.S.", "AuthorID": "7006741537", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57213073978": {"Name": "Sanderson S.C.", "AuthorID": "57213073978", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "56667204300": {"Name": "Searle B.", "AuthorID": "56667204300", "AffiliationID": "116053797", "AffiliationName": "Unique\u2014The Rare Chromosome Disorder Support Group"}, "57202856729": {"Name": "Hunter A.", "AuthorID": "57202856729", "AffiliationID": "60114307", "AffiliationName": "Genetic Alliance UK"}, "8560282000": {"Name": "Patch C.", "AuthorID": "8560282000", "AffiliationID": "118260862", "AffiliationName": "Counselling, Society and Ethics Research, Wellcome Genome Campus"}}}
