However, in some scenarios, HCV resistance to antiviral therapies may have an impact on treatment success. Public Health England's HCV Resistance Group was established to support clinicians treating people with HCV, where the issue of resistance may be a factor in clinical decision-making, and this review includes the Group's current recommendations on the use of HCV resistance testing. The authors describe the principles behind and approach to HCV resistance testing and consider evidence from in vitro studies, clinical trials and real world cohorts on the impact of HCV resistance on treatment outcomes for particular DAA regimens. Five scenarios are identified in the UK and similar settings, where, in the Group's opinion, resistance testing should be performed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Direct acting antivirals", "Hepatitis C virus", "Resistance testing", "Sequencing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antiviral Agents", "Disease Management", "England", "Hepacivirus", "Hepatitis C, Chronic", "Humans", "Microbial Sensitivity Tests", "Practice Guidelines as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075526877", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"54779339000": {"Name": "Bradshaw D.", "AuthorID": "54779339000", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "6506370126": {"Name": "Mbisa J.L.", "AuthorID": "6506370126", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "6701366859": {"Name": "Geretti A.M.", "AuthorID": "6701366859", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool"}, "57205983672": {"Name": "Healy B.J.", "AuthorID": "57205983672", "AffiliationID": "60111558", "AffiliationName": "Public Health Wales"}, "57199371710": {"Name": "Cooke G.S.", "AuthorID": "57199371710", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London"}, "7403211206": {"Name": "Foster G.R.", "AuthorID": "7403211206", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University of London"}, "57213587752": {"Name": "Thomson E.C.", "AuthorID": "57213587752", "AffiliationID": "60162085", "AffiliationName": "MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"}, "57200000054": {"Name": "McLauchlan J.", "AuthorID": "57200000054", "AffiliationID": "60162085", "AffiliationName": "MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"}, "7201380739": {"Name": "Agarwal K.", "AuthorID": "7201380739", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Liver Studies, King's College Hospital"}, "56466212800": {"Name": "Sabin C.", "AuthorID": "56466212800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7005974457": {"Name": "Mutimer D.", "AuthorID": "7005974457", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "University of Birmingham"}, "7103406216": {"Name": "Moss P.", "AuthorID": "7103406216", "AffiliationID": "60005954", "AffiliationName": "Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "7006557980": {"Name": "Irving W.L.", "AuthorID": "7006557980", "AffiliationID": "60024834, 60015138", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine & Health Sciences, University of Nottingham"}, "57211959710": {"Name": "Barnes E.", "AuthorID": "57211959710", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Peter Medawar Building for Pathogen Research, University of Oxford"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
