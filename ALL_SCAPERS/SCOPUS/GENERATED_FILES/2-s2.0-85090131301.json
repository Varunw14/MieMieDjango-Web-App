Journal of Philosophy of Education published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Philosophy of Education Society of Great BritainCurrent conceptions of accountability imply that, in order for teachers to be able to hold themselves to account, they need first to have cultivated certain \u2018professional dispositions\u2019. But these conceptions fail to acknowledge the extent to which teachers are first and foremost accountable \u2018as such\u2019. For the early existentialist thought of the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, this relates to a kind of responsibility premised on the ways in which we are always and inevitably responding to the world in which we find ourselves (with others). In this paper, I offer a reconceptualisation of teacher accountability in light of this, one that recognises implicit responses in classroom situations as underpinned by the subjectivity of those who bring these situations to light\u2014often in subtle and immeasurable ways.", "AuthorKeywords": ["accountability", "ontology", "responsibility", "Sartre"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090131301", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"]], "AuthorData": {"57188751541": {"Name": "Brady A.M.", "AuthorID": "57188751541", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
