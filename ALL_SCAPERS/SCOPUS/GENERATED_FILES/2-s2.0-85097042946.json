Such word-finding difficulties (WFD) can impact social development and educational outcomes. This research aims to develop the evidence-base for supporting children with WFD and inform the design and analysis of intervention studies. We included 20 children (age 6 to 8) with WFD each of whom participated in two interventions one targeting semantic attributes and the other phonological attributes of target words. The interventions, employing word-webs, were carefully constructed to facilitate direct comparison of outcome which was analysed at both group and case-series level. The study used a robust crossover design with pre-intervention baseline, between\u2013intervention wash-out and post-intervention follow-up testing. We incorporated: matching of item sets on individual performance at baseline, independent randomisation of order of intervention and items to condition, blinding of assessor, evaluation of fidelity and control items. The interventions were clinically feasible, with weekly sessions over six weeks. Intervention improved children's word-finding abilities with statistically significant change only during treatment phases of the study and not over baseline, wash-out or follow-up phases. For the group the semantic intervention resulted in a gain of almost twice as many items as the phonological intervention, a significant difference. However, children differed in their response to intervention. Importantly, case-series analysis revealed outcomes predictable on the basis of children's theoretically driven language profiles. Taking account of individual profiles in determining choice of intervention would enable more children to benefit. The study provides new evidence to inform and refine clinical practice with this population. Future studies should be designed such that results can be analysed at both group and case series levels to extend theoretical understanding and optimise use of appropriate interventions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Developmental language disorder", "Intervention", "Phonological", "Semantic", "Word-finding"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85097042946", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"7006621998": {"Name": "Best W.", "AuthorID": "7006621998", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "55935638700": {"Name": "Hughes L.", "AuthorID": "55935638700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "57195250250": {"Name": "Shobbrook K.", "AuthorID": "57195250250", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "7004870911": {"Name": "Masterson J.", "AuthorID": "7004870911", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Human Development, UCL Institute of Education"}, "55345437400": {"Name": "Kapikian A.", "AuthorID": "55345437400", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Human Development, UCL Institute of Education"}, "57203520032": {"Name": "Thomas M.S.C.", "AuthorID": "57203520032", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck College London"}, "35848524900": {"Name": "Howard D.", "AuthorID": "35848524900", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "School for Education, Communication and Language Sciences, Newcastle University"}}}
