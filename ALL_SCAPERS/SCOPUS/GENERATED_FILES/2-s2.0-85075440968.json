This part comprises the molecular dynamics simulations of the binding of three eicosanoid substrates to wild type and mutant forms of the enzyme. These simulations were carried out with the aim of dissecting the importance of individual residues in the active site and the roles they might play in dictating the binding and catalytic specificity exhibited by CYP2J2. Data description: The data comprise: (a) a new homology model of CYP2J2, (b) a number of predicted low-energy complexes of CYP2J2 with arachidonic acid, docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, produced with molecular docking and (c) a series of molecular dynamics simulations of the wild type and four mutants interacting with arachidonic acid as well as simulations of the wild type interacting with the two other eicosanoid ligands. The simulations may be helpful in identifying the determinants of substrate specificity of this enzyme and in unraveling the role of individual mutations on its function. They may also help guide the generation of mutants with altered substrate preferences.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Arachidonic acid", "CYP2J2", "Cytochrome P450", "Docking", "Docosahexaenoic acid", "Eicosapentaenoic acid", "Homology model", "Molecular dynamics", "Polyunsaturated fatty acids", "Polyunsaturated fatty acids"], "IndexKeywords": ["Arachidonic Acid", "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System", "Docosahexaenoic Acids", "Eicosapentaenoic Acid", "Fatty Acids, Unsaturated", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Models, Chemical", "Molecular Docking Simulation", "Mutation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075440968", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"57191754342": {"Name": "Abelak K.K.", "AuthorID": "57191754342", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Comparative Biomedical Sciences, Royal Veterinary College"}, "26643018700": {"Name": "Bishop-Bailey D.", "AuthorID": "26643018700", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Comparative Biomedical Sciences, Royal Veterinary College"}, "6603320944": {"Name": "Nobeli I.", "AuthorID": "6603320944", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck"}}}
