We investigated serum levels of PLGF and its \u201cscavenger\u201d, the receptor soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFLT1, or sVEGFR1), in ACLD patients with different severity of PH and portal-hypertensive gastropathy (PHG). Methods: PLGF and sVEGFR1 were measured in ACLD patients with hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) \u22656 mmHg (n = 241) and endoscopic evaluation of PHG (n = 216). Patients with pre-/posthepatic PH, TIPS, liver transplantation and hepatocellular carcinoma were excluded. Results: Thirty-two (13%) patients had HVPG 6\u20139 mmHg, 128 (53%) 10\u201319 mmHg and 81 (34%) \u226520 mmHg; 141 (59%) had decompensated ACLD (dACLD). PLGF (median 17.2 vs. 20.8 vs. 22.4 pg/mL; p = 0.002), sVEGFR1 (median 96.0 vs. 104.8 vs. 119.3 pg/mL; p < 0.001) levels increased across HVPG strata, while PLGF/sVEGFR1 ratios remained similar (0.19 vs. 0.20 vs. 0.18 pg/mL; p = 0.140). The correlation between PLGF and HVPG was weak (Rho = 0.190,95%CI 0.06\u20130.31; p = 0.003), and the PLGF/sVEGFR1 ratio did not correlate with HVPG (p = 0.331). The area-under-the-receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) for PLGF to detect clinically significant PH (CSPH;i.e. HVPG \u2265 10 mmHg) yielded only 0.688 (0.60\u20130.78; p < 0.001). When compared to ACLD patients without PHG, PLGF levels (20 without vs. 21.4 with mild vs. 17.1 pg/mL with severe PHG, respectively; p = 0.005) and PLGF/sVEGFR1 ratios (0.20 vs. 0.19 vs. 0.17; p = 0.076) did not increase with mild and severe PHG. Conclusion: While PLGF levels tended to increase with severity of PH, the PLGF/sVEGFR1 ratio remained stable across HVPG strata. Neither PLGF nor the PLGF/sVEGFR1 ratio had diagnostic value for prediction of CSPH. The severity of PHG was also not associated with stepwise increases in PLGF levels or PLGF/sVEGFR1 ratio.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Angiogenesis", "Cirrhosis", "HVPG", "PLGF", "Portal-hypertensive gastropathy", "SFLT1"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092141377", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"56658776100": {"Name": "Simbrunner B.", "AuthorID": "56658776100", "AffiliationID": "60011394, 60121828", "AffiliationName": "Christian-Doppler Laboratory for Portal Hypertension and Liver Fibrosis, Medical University of Vienna"}, "57195417369": {"Name": "Stadlmann A.", "AuthorID": "57195417369", "AffiliationID": "112586821", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Hietzing"}, "35485391200": {"Name": "Schwabl P.", "AuthorID": "35485391200", "AffiliationID": "60011394, 60121828", "AffiliationName": "Christian-Doppler Laboratory for Portal Hypertension and Liver Fibrosis, Medical University of Vienna"}, "56521656600": {"Name": "Paternostro R.", "AuthorID": "56521656600", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Laboratory, Medical University of Vienna"}, "57195487529": {"Name": "Bauer D.J.M.", "AuthorID": "57195487529", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Laboratory, Medical University of Vienna"}, "56176028800": {"Name": "Bucsics T.", "AuthorID": "56176028800", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Laboratory, Medical University of Vienna"}, "55803009600": {"Name": "Scheiner B.", "AuthorID": "55803009600", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Laboratory, Medical University of Vienna"}, "25226313400": {"Name": "Pinter M.", "AuthorID": "25226313400", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna"}, "36769160400": {"Name": "St\u00e4ttermayer A.F.", "AuthorID": "36769160400", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna"}, "7006061605": {"Name": "Trauner M.", "AuthorID": "7006061605", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna"}, "55369068500": {"Name": "Mandorfer M.", "AuthorID": "55369068500", "AffiliationID": "60011394, 60121828", "AffiliationName": "Christian-Doppler Laboratory for Portal Hypertension and Liver Fibrosis, Medical University of Vienna"}, "24315181000": {"Name": "Reiberger T.", "AuthorID": "24315181000", "AffiliationID": "60011394, 60121828", "AffiliationName": "Christian-Doppler Laboratory for Portal Hypertension and Liver Fibrosis, Medical University of Vienna"}, "41261795800": {"Name": "Lampichler K.", "AuthorID": "41261795800", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Medical University of Vienna"}, "57207460787": {"Name": "W\u00f6ran K.", "AuthorID": "57207460787", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Medical University of Vienna"}, "55174946900": {"Name": "Beer A.", "AuthorID": "55174946900", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Medical University of Vienna"}, "7801395921": {"Name": "Eigenbauer E.", "AuthorID": "7801395921", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "IT4Science, Medical University of Vienna"}, "7003758775": {"Name": "Marculescu R.", "AuthorID": "7003758775", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna"}, "7004356027": {"Name": "Szekeres T.", "AuthorID": "7004356027", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna"}}}
