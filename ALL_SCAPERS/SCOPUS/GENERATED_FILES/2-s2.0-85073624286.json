Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc on behalf of American Neurological Association.Objective: To study if treatment with triheptanoin, a 7-carbon triglyceride, improves exercise tolerance in patients with McArdle disease. McArdle patients have a complete block in glycogenolysis and glycogen-dependent expansion of tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), which may restrict fat oxidation. We hypothesized that triheptanoin metabolism generates substrates for the TCA, which potentially boosts fat oxidation and improves exercise tolerance in McArdle disease. Methods: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in patients with McArdle disease completing two treatment periods of 14 days each with a triheptanoin or placebo diet (1 g/kg/day). Primary outcome was change in mean heart rate during 20 min submaximal exercise on a cycle ergometer. Secondary outcomes were change in peak workload and oxygen uptake along with changes in blood metabolites and respiratory quotients. Results: Nineteen of 22 patients completed the trial. Malate levels rose on triheptanoin treatment versus placebo (8.0 \u00b1 SD2.3 vs. 5.5 \u00b1 SD1.8 \u00b5mol/L, P < 0.001), but dropped from rest to exercise (P < 0.001). There was no difference in exercise heart rates between triheptanoin (120 \u00b1 SD16 bpm) and placebo (121 \u00b1 SD16 bpm) treatments. Compared with placebo, triheptanoin did not change the submaximal respiratory quotient (0.82 \u00b1 SD0.05 vs. 0.84 \u00b1 SD0.03), peak workload (105 \u00b1 SD38 vs. 102 \u00b1 SD31 Watts), or peak oxygen uptake (1938 \u00b1 SD499 vs. 1977 \u00b1 SD380 mL/min). Interpretation: Despite increased resting plasma malate with triheptanoin, the increase was insufficient to generate a normal TCA turnover during exercise and the treatment has no effect on exercise capacity or oxidative metabolism in patients with McArdle disease.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Cross-Over Studies", "Double-Blind Method", "Exercise Tolerance", "Female", "Glycogen Storage Disease Type V", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Outcome Assessment, Health Care", "Oxygen", "Triglycerides", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073624286", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55354351600": {"Name": "Madsen K.L.", "AuthorID": "55354351600", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Copenhagen Neuromuscular Center, Department of Neurology, Rigshospitalet and University of Copenhagen"}, "57196085091": {"Name": "Buch A.E.", "AuthorID": "57196085091", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Copenhagen Neuromuscular Center, Department of Neurology, Rigshospitalet and University of Copenhagen"}, "57200127569": {"Name": "Stemmerik M.G.", "AuthorID": "57200127569", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Copenhagen Neuromuscular Center, Department of Neurology, Rigshospitalet and University of Copenhagen"}, "57216358854": {"Name": "Raaschou-Pedersen D.T.", "AuthorID": "57216358854", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Copenhagen Neuromuscular Center, Department of Neurology, Rigshospitalet and University of Copenhagen"}, "57200081947": {"Name": "Poulsen N.S.", "AuthorID": "57200081947", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Copenhagen Neuromuscular Center, Department of Neurology, Rigshospitalet and University of Copenhagen"}, "7005973881": {"Name": "Vissing J.", "AuthorID": "7005973881", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Copenhagen Neuromuscular Center, Department of Neurology, Rigshospitalet and University of Copenhagen"}, "26643311700": {"Name": "Lafor\u00eat P.", "AuthorID": "26643311700", "AffiliationID": "60013727, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Centre de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence des maladies neuromusculaires Nord/Est/Ile de France, Service de Neurologie, H\u00f4pital Raymond-Poincar\u00e9, AP-HP"}, "7005986708": {"Name": "Ottolenghi C.", "AuthorID": "7005986708", "AffiliationID": "60123796, 60021567, 60026877", "AffiliationName": "Metabolomics Unit, Service des Explorations fonctionnelles, Necker Hospital and Descartes University of Paris, AP-HP"}, "7005197118": {"Name": "Hatem S.N.", "AuthorID": "7005197118", "AffiliationID": "60015622, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Institute, La Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital, AP-HP"}, "57204228149": {"Name": "Ceccaldi A.", "AuthorID": "57204228149", "AffiliationID": "60015622, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Institute, La Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital, AP-HP"}, "57196005475": {"Name": "Atencio M.", "AuthorID": "57196005475", "AffiliationID": "60120341, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Inserm U 1127, CNRS UMR 7225, ICM"}, "57195130283": {"Name": "Luton M.P.", "AuthorID": "57195130283", "AffiliationID": "60120341, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Inserm U 1127, CNRS UMR 7225, ICM"}, "23005241600": {"Name": "Mochel F.", "AuthorID": "23005241600", "AffiliationID": "60015622, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics and Reference Center for Adult Neurometabolic diseases, La Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re University Hospital, APHP"}, "24499867900": {"Name": "Haller R.G.", "AuthorID": "24499867900", "AffiliationID": "60014739, 60026695", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Neurotherapeutics, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Dallas"}, "57208851936": {"Name": "Quinlivan R.", "AuthorID": "57208851936", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square"}}}
