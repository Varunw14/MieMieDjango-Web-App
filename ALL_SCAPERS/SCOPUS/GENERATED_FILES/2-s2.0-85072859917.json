Whether one follows a targeted or a diversification driven strategy, a search landscape needs to be large, continuous, easy to construct and representative of the underlying property of interest. Constructing such a landscape is not a trivial task often requiring a significant manual effort by an expert. We present an approach for constructing meaningful and convenient fitness landscapes using neural networks (NN) \u2013 for targeted and diversification strategies alike. We suggest that output of an NN predictor can be interpreted as a fitness for a targeted strategy. The NN is trained on a corpus of execution traces and various properties of interest, prior to searching. During search, the trained NN is queried to predict an estimate of a property given an execution trace. The outputs of the NN form a convenient search space which is strongly representative of a number of properties. We believe that such a search space can be readily used for driving a search towards specific properties of interest. For a diversification strategy, we propose the use of an autoencoder; a mechanism for compacting data into an n-dimensional \u201clatent\u201d space. In it, datapoints are arranged according to the similarity of their salient features. We show that a latent space of execution traces possesses characteristics of a convenient search landscape: it is continuous, large and crucially, it defines a notion of similarity to arbitrary observations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fitness function", "Machine learning", "Neural networks", "Search-Based Software Testing", "Software engineering"], "IndexKeywords": ["Diversification strategies", "Fitness functions", "Fitness landscape", "Neural network (nn)", "Salient features", "Search landscapes", "Search-based software testing", "Specific properties"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072859917", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57193923376": {"Name": "Joffe L.", "AuthorID": "57193923376", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57213931369": {"Name": "Clark D.", "AuthorID": "57213931369", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
