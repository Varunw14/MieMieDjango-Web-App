According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the most effective means of minimizing the spread of the virus is through reducing interactions between individuals [2]. We performed a review of the literature, as well as national and international treatment guidelines, seeking data in support of the RADS principle (Remote visits, Avoid radiation, Defer radiation, Shorten radiation) [3] as it applies to gastrointestinal cancers. The purpose of the present work is to guide radiation oncologists managing patients with gastrointestinal cancers during the COVID-19 crisis in order to maintain the safety of our patients, while minimizing the impact of the pandemic on cancer outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["COVID-19", "Gastrointestinal neoplasms", "Pandemic", "Radiation oncology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Betacoronavirus", "Coronavirus Infections", "Gastrointestinal Neoplasms", "Guidelines as Topic", "Humans", "Pandemics", "Pneumonia, Viral"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084351859", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"37111243900": {"Name": "Tchelebi L.T.", "AuthorID": "37111243900", "AffiliationID": "60027671", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Penn State College of Medicine"}, "57203106462": {"Name": "Haustermans K.", "AuthorID": "57203106462", "AffiliationID": "124372223", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Particle Therapy Interuniversity Center Leuven"}, "6505961227": {"Name": "Scorsetti M.", "AuthorID": "6505961227", "AffiliationID": "60107210", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, Humanitas University"}, "25652730800": {"Name": "Dawson L.A.", "AuthorID": "25652730800", "AffiliationID": "60107210", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, Humanitas University"}, "57164611600": {"Name": "Hosni A.", "AuthorID": "57164611600", "AffiliationID": "60016849, 60008768", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Toronto, Radiation Medicine Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Center"}, "57210908503": {"Name": "Huguet F.", "AuthorID": "57210908503", "AffiliationID": "60021567, 60001422, 60014254", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, H\u00f4pital Tenon, AP-HP.Sorbonne Universit\u00e9"}, "9275515900": {"Name": "Hawkins M.A.", "AuthorID": "9275515900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7006724924": {"Name": "Goodman K.A.", "AuthorID": "7006724924", "AffiliationID": "60004670", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, The Mount Sinai Hospital"}}}
