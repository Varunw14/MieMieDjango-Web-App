Methods: We included 220 primary-progressive multiple sclerosis patients from a phase 2 clinical trial, with baseline and week-48 3DT1-weighted MRI of the brain and spinal cord (1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm3), acquired separately. We obtained segmentation-based cross-sectional spinal cord area (CSA) at C1-2 (from both brain and spinal cord MRI) and C2-5 levels (from spinal cord MRI) using DeepSeg, and, then, we computed corresponding GBSI. Results: Depending on the spinal cord segment, we included 67.4\u201398.1% patients for CSA measurements, and 66.9\u201384.2% for GBSI. Spinal cord atrophy measurements obtained with GBSI had lower measurement variability, than corresponding CSA. Looking at the image noise floor, the lowest median standard deviation of the MRI signal within the cerebrospinal fluid surrounding the spinal cord was found on brain MRI at the C1-2 level. Spinal cord atrophy derived from brain MRI was related to the corresponding measures from dedicated spinal cord MRI, more strongly for GBSI than CSA. Spinal cord atrophy measurements using GBSI, but not CSA, were associated with upper and lower limb motor progression. Discussion: Notwithstanding the reduced measurement variability, the clinical correlates, and the possibility of using brain acquisitions, spinal cord atrophy using GBSI should remain a secondary outcome measure in MS studies, until further advancements increase the quality of acquisition and reliability of processing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atrophy", "Clinical trial", "GBSI", "Multiple sclerosis", "Spinal cord"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091206830", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"36461391900": {"Name": "Moccia M.", "AuthorID": "36461391900", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Multiple Sclerosis Clinical Care and Research Centre, Department of Neurosciences, Federico II University"}, "57219088191": {"Name": "Valsecchi N.", "AuthorID": "57219088191", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148, 60176027", "AffiliationName": "Queen Square Multiple Sclerosis Centre, Department of Neuroinflammation, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "7003671038": {"Name": "Ciccarelli O.", "AuthorID": "7003671038", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research, University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre"}, "57204594265": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "57204594265", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, VU University Medical Centre"}, "57193550334": {"Name": "Prados F.", "AuthorID": "57193550334", "AffiliationID": "60002581", "AffiliationName": "Open University of Catalonia"}, "6603788231": {"Name": "Van Schijndel R.", "AuthorID": "6603788231", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, VU University Medical Centre"}}}
