Complications of mineral bone disease (MBD) are common and contribute to the high morbidity and mortality seen in children with CKD. Although several studies describe the prevalence of abnormal calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D levels as well as associated clinical and radiological complications and their medical management, little is known about the dietary requirements and management of calcium (Ca) and phosphate (P) in children with CKD. The Pediatric Renal Nutrition Taskforce (PRNT) is an international team of pediatric renal dietitians and pediatric nephrologists, who develop clinical practice recommendations (CPRs) for the nutritional management of various aspects of renal disease management in children. We present CPRs for the dietary intake of Ca and P in children with CKD stages 2\u20135 and on dialysis (CKD2-5D), describing the common Ca- and P-containing foods, the assessment of dietary Ca and P intake, requirements for Ca and P in healthy children and necessary modifications for children with CKD2-5D, and dietary management of hypo- and hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. The statements have been graded, and statements with a low grade or those that are opinion-based must be carefully considered and adapted to individual patient needs based on the clinical judgment of the treating physician and dietitian. These CPRs will be regularly audited and updated by the PRNT.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Calcium", "Children", "Chronic kidney disease (CKD)", "Nutrition", "Phosphate"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074704066", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"57211643849": {"Name": "McAlister L.", "AuthorID": "57211643849", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, and University College London, Institute of Child Health"}, "16146771300": {"Name": "Rees L.", "AuthorID": "16146771300", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, and University College London, Institute of Child Health"}, "7003372342": {"Name": "Shaw V.", "AuthorID": "7003372342", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012662, 60024779", "AffiliationName": "University of Plymouth and University College London Institute of Child Health"}, "22956754100": {"Name": "Shroff R.", "AuthorID": "22956754100", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, and University College London, Institute of Child Health"}, "57200515061": {"Name": "Pugh P.", "AuthorID": "57200515061", "AffiliationID": "60025016", "AffiliationName": "Nottingham Children\u2019s Hospital, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "7004805574": {"Name": "Greenbaum L.", "AuthorID": "7004805574", "AffiliationID": "60000928", "AffiliationName": "Emory University and Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta"}, "7005877632": {"Name": "Haffner D.", "AuthorID": "7005877632", "AffiliationID": "60024052", "AffiliationName": "Children\u2019s Hospital, Hannover Medical School"}, "56652897400": {"Name": "Anderson C.", "AuthorID": "56652897400", "AffiliationID": "60021722, 60000703", "AffiliationName": "Southampton Children\u2019s Hospital, University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56586172600": {"Name": "Desloovere A.", "AuthorID": "56586172600", "AffiliationID": "60068590", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital Ghent"}, "12760188700": {"Name": "Walle J.V.", "AuthorID": "12760188700", "AffiliationID": "60068590", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital Ghent"}, "57203435363": {"Name": "Nelms C.", "AuthorID": "57203435363", "AffiliationID": "60026306", "AffiliationName": "PedsFeeds LLC, University of Nebraska"}, "55376979300": {"Name": "Oosterveld M.", "AuthorID": "55376979300", "AffiliationID": "60070178, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Emma Children\u2019s Hospital, Amsterdam University Medical Center"}, "6506392620": {"Name": "Paglialonga F.", "AuthorID": "6506392620", "AffiliationID": "60007067, 60033731", "AffiliationName": "Fondazione IRCCS Ca\u2019Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico"}, "57194279378": {"Name": "Polderman N.", "AuthorID": "57194279378", "AffiliationID": "60008667", "AffiliationName": "British Columbia Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "55155598000": {"Name": "Qizalbash L.", "AuthorID": "55155598000", "AffiliationID": "112928806", "AffiliationName": "Great Northern Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "57211637890": {"Name": "Renken-Terhaerdt J.", "AuthorID": "57211637890", "AffiliationID": "60070170, 60032724", "AffiliationName": "Wilhelmina Children\u2019s Hospital, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "25639282100": {"Name": "Tuokkola J.", "AuthorID": "25639282100", "AffiliationID": "60000113, 60016987, 60002952", "AffiliationName": "Children\u2019s Hospital and Clinical Nutrition Unit, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital"}, "7005909531": {"Name": "Warady B.", "AuthorID": "7005909531", "AffiliationID": "114392415", "AffiliationName": "Children\u2019s Mercy Kansas City"}}}
