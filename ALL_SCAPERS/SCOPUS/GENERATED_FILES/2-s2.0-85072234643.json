In spite of progress made in our general understanding of BBS aetiology, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment in BBS remain elusive. Here, we report that the loss of BBS proteins causes synaptic dysfunction in principal neurons, providing a possible explanation for the cognitive impairment phenotype observed in BBS patients. Using synaptosomal proteomics and immunocytochemistry, we demonstrate the presence of Bbs proteins in the postsynaptic density (PSD) of hippocampal neurons. Loss of Bbs results in a significant reduction of dendritic spines in principal neurons of Bbs mouse models. Furthermore, we show that spine deficiency correlates with events that destabilise spine architecture, such as impaired spine membrane receptor signalling, known to be involved in the maintenance of dendritic spines. Our findings suggest a role for BBS proteins in dendritic spine homeostasis that may be linked to the cognitive phenotype observed in BBS.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Anxiety", "Bardet-Biedl Syndrome", "Cytoskeletal Proteins", "Dendritic Spines", "Dentate Gyrus", "Disease Models, Animal", "Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials", "Female", "Male", "Memory", "Mice", "Receptor, IGF Type 1", "Synaptosomes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072234643", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"57210798158": {"Name": "Haq N.", "AuthorID": "57210798158", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "55250336400": {"Name": "Forsythe E.", "AuthorID": "55250336400", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7004556611": {"Name": "Beales P.L.", "AuthorID": "7004556611", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "55908438200": {"Name": "Christou-Savina S.", "AuthorID": "55908438200", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "8069944100": {"Name": "Schmidt-Hieber C.", "AuthorID": "8069944100", "AffiliationID": "60089914", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7003425281": {"Name": "H\u00e4usser M.", "AuthorID": "7003425281", "AffiliationID": "60089914", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "55221817100": {"Name": "Sialana F.J.", "AuthorID": "55221817100", "AffiliationID": "60025988", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of Vienna"}, "8367713200": {"Name": "Ciani L.", "AuthorID": "8367713200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "7005468805": {"Name": "Salinas P.", "AuthorID": "7005468805", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "26653485700": {"Name": "Heller J.P.", "AuthorID": "26653485700", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "54912692900": {"Name": "Stewart M.", "AuthorID": "54912692900", "AffiliationID": "101572462", "AffiliationName": "MRC Harwell Institute, Mary Lyon Centre, Harwell Campus"}, "7003321160": {"Name": "Bentley L.", "AuthorID": "7003321160", "AffiliationID": "101572462", "AffiliationName": "MRC Harwell Institute, Mary Lyon Centre, Harwell Campus"}, "57197474223": {"Name": "Wells S.", "AuthorID": "57197474223", "AffiliationID": "101572462", "AffiliationName": "MRC Harwell Institute, Mary Lyon Centre, Harwell Campus"}, "7202342550": {"Name": "Nolan P.M.", "AuthorID": "7202342550", "AffiliationID": "101572462", "AffiliationName": "MRC Harwell Institute, Mary Lyon Centre, Harwell Campus"}, "6701662503": {"Name": "Rodenburg R.J.", "AuthorID": "6701662503", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Radboud Center for Mitochondrial Medicine, Translational Metabolic Laboratory, Department of Pediatrics, Radboud University Medical Centre"}, "57217027500": {"Name": "Wu M.C.", "AuthorID": "57217027500", "AffiliationID": "109985931", "AffiliationName": "Neurodigitech, LLC"}, "57217609070": {"Name": "Lubec G.", "AuthorID": "57217609070", "AffiliationID": "60014976", "AffiliationName": "Programme in Proteomics, Paracelsus Private Medical University"}}}
