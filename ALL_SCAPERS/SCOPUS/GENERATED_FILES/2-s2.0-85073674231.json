Dialectical Behavioural Therapy (DBT) trials have found promising results in treating self-harm in outpatient settings; however findings for inpatient settings are still limited. Method: A single-arm feasibility trial was conducted examining a DBT-informed \u2018Coping with Crisis\u2019 (CwC) group protocol, which focused on self-harm and crisis management strategies. Twenty-four participants were recruited from an inpatient ward in a National Health Service (NHS) Trust in the UK. The Inventory of Statements about Self-Injury and Distress Tolerance Scale were administered at baseline and post-therapy. Data was collected on the rates of recruitment, retention, session attendance, outcome measure completion, adverse events and participant feedback, in order to inform the design of a main study. Results: Findings indicated that it was feasible to run the CWC group and research study on an inpatient ward. However, there were several challenges in recruiting to target (80% achieved) and retaining participants (38% of consented participants completed). A number of implementation issues were identified and recommendations have been made to inform future group and study designs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dialectical-behavioural therapy", "Feasibility", "Self-har"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Behavior Therapy", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Patient Selection", "Psychiatric Department, Hospital", "Psychotherapy, Group", "Research Design", "Self-Injurious Behavior", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073674231", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"56480566200": {"Name": "Fife S.", "AuthorID": "56480566200", "AffiliationID": "60001359", "AffiliationName": "The Department of Health and Social Care, University of Essex"}, "57195233675": {"Name": "Blumenfeld F.", "AuthorID": "57195233675", "AffiliationID": "60001359", "AffiliationName": "The Department of Health and Social Care, University of Essex"}, "7202513618": {"Name": "Wood L.", "AuthorID": "7202513618", "AffiliationID": "60001359", "AffiliationName": "The Department of Health and Social Care, University of Essex"}, "57204051806": {"Name": "Williams C.", "AuthorID": "57204051806", "AffiliationID": "60107401", "AffiliationName": "Goodmayes Hospital, North East London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
