Among the hominins, studies that have examined Retzius periodicity (RP) variation have come to contradictory conclusions in some instances. To clarify RP variation among hominins and better place this variation in its broader evolutionary context, we conduct the most comprehensive analysis of published RP values for hominins and great apes to date. We gathered all available data from the literature on RP data from extant humans, great apes, and fossil hominins and assessed their variation using parametric and nonparametric analyses of variance. We also performed phylogenetic generalized least-squares regressions of RP data for these taxa as well as a larger set of hominoids for which RP data have been published against data for body mass, encephalization, and mean semicircular canal radius (a proxy for metabolic rate). Our results show that modern humans have a mean RP significantly differing from that of other hominins. Pongo also is significantly different from nearly all other taxa in all analyses. Our results also demonstrate that RP variation among hominins scales with respect to body mass, encephalization, and semicircular canal radius similarly to other hominids but that modern humans and Pongo stand out in this regard. Operating within the hypothesis that RP reflects autonomic biorhythms that regulate multiple life history variables, our results reinforce the idea that Homo sapiens has evolved a life history distinct from other hominins, even from other members of Homo, and suggest that many of these life history differences may be driven by hypothalamic output from the brain.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Enamel microstructure", "Havers-Halberg oscillation", "Incremental lines", "Life history", "Striae of Retzius"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087897078", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"]], "AuthorData": {"36958720600": {"Name": "Hogg R.", "AuthorID": "36958720600", "AffiliationID": "60009668", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Florida Gulf Coast University"}, "6508136683": {"Name": "Lacruz R.", "AuthorID": "6508136683", "AffiliationID": "60108355", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic Science and Craniofacial Biology, New York University College of Dentistry"}, "7004110041": {"Name": "Bromage T.G.", "AuthorID": "7004110041", "AffiliationID": "60108355", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomaterials and Biomimetics, New York University College of Dentistry"}, "7201596226": {"Name": "Dean M.C.", "AuthorID": "7201596226", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "6602722066": {"Name": "Ramirez-Rozzi F.", "AuthorID": "6602722066", "AffiliationID": "60070481, 60123773", "AffiliationName": "\u00c9coanthropologie, Mus\u00e9e de l'Homme, UMR 7206"}, "56029174700": {"Name": "Girimurugan S.B.", "AuthorID": "56029174700", "AffiliationID": "60009668", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Florida Gulf Coast University"}, "57188751655": {"Name": "McGrosky A.", "AuthorID": "57188751655", "AffiliationID": "60086304, 60003892", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Human Origins, School of Human Evolution and Social Change, Arizona State University"}, "7403155142": {"Name": "Schwartz G.T.", "AuthorID": "7403155142", "AffiliationID": "60086304, 60003892", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Human Origins, School of Human Evolution and Social Change, Arizona State University"}}}
