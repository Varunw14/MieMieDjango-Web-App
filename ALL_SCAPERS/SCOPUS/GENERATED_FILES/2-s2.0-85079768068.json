Design/methodology/approach: Data were derived from seven semi-structured interviews from three forensic community teams. Findings: Thematic analysis identified seven predominant themes: (1) the uncertainty of the discharge timeframe; (2) fear of jeopardising discharge; (3) progress; (4) engagement with community life; (5) barriers to social engagement; (6) evolving identity and (7) someone to turn to. Findings are discussed in relation to the recovery model and the good lives model. Practical implications: The findings highlight the importance of fostering trust between MDOs and their care teams to encourage help-seeking. They also suggest that resources should be sequenced appropriately throughout the discharge process, to match the \u201cwindow of engagement\u201d and maximize impact and effectiveness. Originality/value: This research gained rarely obtained first-hand perspectives from MDOs, with the findings contributing to a more effective evaluation of the discharge pathway.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Desistance", "Forensic", "Good lives model", "Inpatient", "Mentally disordered offenders", "Recovery", "Recovery model", "Rehabilitation", "Reintegration", "Section 37/41", "Thematic analysis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079768068", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"57215068130": {"Name": "McDonnaugh T.", "AuthorID": "57215068130", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "57215049090": {"Name": "Underwood A.", "AuthorID": "57215049090", "AffiliationID": "123934570", "AffiliationName": "Stalking Threat Assessment Centre (STAC"}, "23007289500": {"Name": "Williams A.", "AuthorID": "23007289500", "AffiliationID": "60033387", "AffiliationName": "Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University, College London"}}}
