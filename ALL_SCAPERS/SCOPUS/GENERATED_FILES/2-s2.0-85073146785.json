The Litvish community holds religious study as a central cultural value. Aside from identification with the group, communal identity is also channelled to exposing the younger generation, from an early age to the community\u2019s values and educating him within as homogeneous an environment as possible, as a means to continuity and strengthening of the community. Thus, the Litvish identity\u2014along with the distinction between those \u201clike us\u201d and \u201cothers\u201d\u2014becomes a central component of the individual\u2019s consciousness, influencing his choices and preferences. Of these, the most significant is the sense of mission\u2014preservation of Jewish survival\u2014that community members feel by their religious status. This feeling bestows tremendous importance on educating the younger generation following the community\u2019s values and enhances the community\u2019s resilience. Common interests and communal identity create internal Litvish mechanisms that educate the younger generation and affect appropriate socialisation.
