The homotetrameric TTR contains two identical thyroxine binding pockets, occupation of which by specific ligands can inhibit TTR amyloidogenesis in vitro. Ligand binding stabilizes the tetramer, inhibiting its proteolytic cleavage and its dissociation. Here, we show with solution-state NMR that ligand binding induces long-distance conformational changes in the TTR that have not previously been detected by X-ray crystallography, consistently with the inhibition of the cleavage of the DE loop. The NMR findings, coupled with surface plasmon resonance measurements, have identified dynamic exchange processes underlying the negative cooperativity of binding of \"monovalent\" ligand tafamidis. In contrast, mds84, our prototypic \"bivalent\" ligand, which is a more potent stabilizer of TTR in vitro that occupies both thyroxine pockets and the intramolecular channel between them, has greater structural effects.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Binding Sites", "Fenamates", "Humans", "Ligands", "Models, Molecular", "Molecular Conformation", "Molecular Structure", "Prealbumin", "Structure-Activity Relationship"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072133000", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"6701582903": {"Name": "Corazza A.", "AuthorID": "6701582903", "AffiliationID": "60082163", "AffiliationName": "Istituto Nazionale Biostrutture e Biosistemi"}, "56502017200": {"Name": "Verona G.", "AuthorID": "56502017200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Drug Discovery Unit, Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "7003800223": {"Name": "Mangione P.P.", "AuthorID": "7003800223", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Biochemistry, University of Pavia"}, "57202845706": {"Name": "Canetti D.", "AuthorID": "57202845706", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Drug Discovery Unit, Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "57210983652": {"Name": "Nocerino P.", "AuthorID": "57210983652", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Drug Discovery Unit, Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "35493762000": {"Name": "Taylor G.W.", "AuthorID": "35493762000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Drug Discovery Unit, Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "56848974700": {"Name": "Pepys M.B.", "AuthorID": "56848974700", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London and Royal Free Hospital"}, "7006438238": {"Name": "Bellotti V.", "AuthorID": "7006438238", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Biochemistry, University of Pavia"}, "28667456400": {"Name": "Waudby C.A.", "AuthorID": "28667456400", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College"}, "55919826700": {"Name": "Christodoulou J.", "AuthorID": "55919826700", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College"}, "57206302993": {"Name": "Bingham R.", "AuthorID": "57206302993", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "GSK Medicines Research Centre"}, "6602754719": {"Name": "Uings I.", "AuthorID": "6602754719", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "GSK Medicines Research Centre"}}}
