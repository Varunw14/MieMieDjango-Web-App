While this was a watershed moment in Irish history, it was not unconnected to wider discussions now taking place around the world concerning gender, reproductive rights, the future of religion, Church\u2013State relationships, democracy and social movements. With this Forum, we want to prompt some anthropological interpretations of Ireland's repeal of the Eighth Amendment as a matter concerning not only reproductive rights, but also questions of life and death, faith and shame, women and men, state power and individual liberty, and more. We also ask what this event might mean (if anything) for other societies dealing with similar issues?.", "AuthorKeywords": ["abortion", "Ireland", "Repeal the 8th", "reproductive rights", "social change"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091832434", "SubjectAreas": [["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"55600653000": {"Name": "Dr\u0105\u017ckiewicz E.", "AuthorID": "55600653000", "AffiliationID": "60026281", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, Maynooth University"}, "7004271482": {"Name": "Strong T.", "AuthorID": "7004271482", "AffiliationID": "60026281", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, Maynooth University"}, "6602376159": {"Name": "Saris A.J.", "AuthorID": "6602376159", "AffiliationID": "60026281", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, Maynooth University"}, "36002512800": {"Name": "Garvey P.", "AuthorID": "36002512800", "AffiliationID": "60026281", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, Maynooth University"}, "6603730976": {"Name": "Scheper-Hughes N.", "AuthorID": "6603730976", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University of California"}, "57201258048": {"Name": "Turpin H.", "AuthorID": "57201258048", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "Queen\u2019s University Belfast"}, "55049259000": {"Name": "Murphy F.", "AuthorID": "55049259000", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "Queen\u2019s University Belfast"}, "16301679600": {"Name": "Mishtal J.", "AuthorID": "16301679600", "AffiliationID": "60022144", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University of Central Florida"}, "22935952000": {"Name": "Wulff H.", "AuthorID": "22935952000", "AffiliationID": "60028378", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Anthropology, Stockholm University"}, "7102910616": {"Name": "French B.", "AuthorID": "7102910616", "AffiliationID": "60028806", "AffiliationName": "Grinnell College"}, "55494852500": {"Name": "Miller D.", "AuthorID": "55494852500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56605957900": {"Name": "Maguire L.", "AuthorID": "56605957900", "AffiliationID": "60104048", "AffiliationName": "National College of Ireland"}, "57219242758": {"Name": "Mh\u00f3rdha M.N.", "AuthorID": "57219242758", "AffiliationID": "60026281", "AffiliationName": "Maynooth University Social Sciences Institute, Maynooth University"}}}
