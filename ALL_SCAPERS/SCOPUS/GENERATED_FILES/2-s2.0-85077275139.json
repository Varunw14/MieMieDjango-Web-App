Periwinkle pyramids are observed only on the lower section of the mudflat, where the maximum temperature of the surficial mud is less than about 40 \u00b0C, while the upper portion of the mudflat, which experiences temperatures > 52 \u00b0C, is barren of gastropods. The periwinkle perched at the apex of the pyramid experiences a temperature that as much as 4\u00b0 lower than that of the surficial mud. Because we did not observe pyramid-building behavior among Gulf periwinkles during winter, we conclude that pyramid-building behavior in P. sulcatus is a thermoregulatory adaptation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Arabian Gulf", "Climate change", "Gastropods", "Planaxis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077275139", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"7202547764": {"Name": "Kaminski M.A.", "AuthorID": "7202547764", "AffiliationID": "60009506", "AffiliationName": "Geosciences Department, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals"}, "56019853700": {"Name": "Garrison T.F.", "AuthorID": "56019853700", "AffiliationID": "60009506", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry Department, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals"}}}
