Our goal was to identify differential gene expression signatures associated with COPD cachexia in current and former smokers. Methods: We analyzed whole-blood gene expression data from participants with COPD in a discovery cohort (COPDGene, N = 400) and assessed replication (ECLIPSE, N = 114). To approximate the consensus definition using available criteria, cachexia was defined as weight-loss > 5% in the past 12 months or low body mass index (BMI) (< 20 kg/m2) and 1/3 criteria: decreased muscle strength (six-minute walk distance < 350 m), anemia (hemoglobin < 12 g/dl), and low fat-free mass index (FFMI) (< 15 kg/m2 among women and < 17 kg/m2 among men) in COPDGene. In ECLIPSE, cachexia was defined as weight-loss > 5% in the past 12 months or low BMI and 3/5 criteria: decreased muscle strength, anorexia, abnormal biochemistry (anemia or high c-reactive protein (> 5 mg/l)), fatigue, and low FFMI. Differential gene expression was assessed between cachectic and non-cachectic subjects, adjusting for age, sex, white blood cell counts, and technical covariates. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using MSigDB. Results: The prevalence of COPD cachexia was 13.7% in COPDGene and 7.9% in ECLIPSE. Fourteen genes were differentially downregulated in cachectic versus non-cachectic COPD patients in COPDGene (FDR < 0.05) and ECLIPSE (FDR < 0.05). Discussion: Several replicated genes regulating heme metabolism were downregulated among participants with COPD cachexia. Impaired heme biosynthesis may contribute to cachexia development through free-iron buildup and oxidative tissue damage.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084360122", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"57215039679": {"Name": "Wilson A.C.", "AuthorID": "57215039679", "AffiliationID": "60027086", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham"}, "23050994300": {"Name": "McDonald M.L.N.", "AuthorID": "23050994300", "AffiliationID": "60027086", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham"}, "57216707302": {"Name": "Kumar P.L.", "AuthorID": "57216707302", "AffiliationID": "60027086", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham"}, "57193361535": {"Name": "Arora I.", "AuthorID": "57193361535", "AffiliationID": "60027086", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham"}, "6603516755": {"Name": "Dransfield M.T.", "AuthorID": "6603516755", "AffiliationID": "60027086", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham"}, "55349830800": {"Name": "Wells J.M.", "AuthorID": "55349830800", "AffiliationID": "60027086", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham"}, "57212896894": {"Name": "Bhatt S.P.", "AuthorID": "57212896894", "AffiliationID": "60027086", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham"}, "7004022821": {"Name": "Thannickal V.J.", "AuthorID": "7004022821", "AffiliationID": "60027086", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham"}, "57208085401": {"Name": "Lee S.", "AuthorID": "57208085401", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60010869", "AffiliationName": "Channing Division of Network Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital"}, "56539212500": {"Name": "Parker M.M.", "AuthorID": "56539212500", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60010869", "AffiliationName": "Channing Division of Network Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital"}, "56499939400": {"Name": "Morrow J.D.", "AuthorID": "56499939400", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60010869", "AffiliationName": "Channing Division of Network Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital"}, "6701515147": {"Name": "Hersh C.P.", "AuthorID": "6701515147", "AffiliationID": "60016782", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital"}, "26323082900": {"Name": "Castaldi P.J.", "AuthorID": "26323082900", "AffiliationID": "60016782", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital"}, "57213401294": {"Name": "Silverman E.K.", "AuthorID": "57213401294", "AffiliationID": "60016782", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital"}, "57200681301": {"Name": "Wouters E.F.M.", "AuthorID": "57200681301", "AffiliationID": "122096335", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Expertise for Chronic Organ Failure Horn"}, "57207894283": {"Name": "Casaburi R.", "AuthorID": "57207894283", "AffiliationID": "60016081, 60138297", "AffiliationName": "Rehabilitation Clinical Trials Center, Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor Harbor-UCLA Medical Center"}, "57202945380": {"Name": "Rennard S.I.", "AuthorID": "57202945380", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "BioPharmaceuticals RandD, AstraZeneca"}, "56892645500": {"Name": "Lomas D.A.", "AuthorID": "56892645500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Respiratory, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "7101749378": {"Name": "Agusti A.", "AuthorID": "7101749378", "AffiliationID": "60001576, 60030315, 60010814", "AffiliationName": "Thorax Institute, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, University of Barcelona"}, "57202568645": {"Name": "Tal-Singer R.", "AuthorID": "57202568645", "AffiliationID": "60097308", "AffiliationName": "GSK RandD"}, "12808786800": {"Name": "Washko G.", "AuthorID": "12808786800", "AffiliationID": "60016782", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital"}, "57218599536": {"Name": "Tiwari H.K.", "AuthorID": "57218599536", "AffiliationID": "60027086", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Alabama at Birmingham"}}}
