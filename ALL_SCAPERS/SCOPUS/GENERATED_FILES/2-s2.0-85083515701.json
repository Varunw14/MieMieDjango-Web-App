Traffic published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Cholesterol homeostasis is critical for cell function and human health. Cholesterol is heterogeneously distributed among cellular membranes, with the redistribution of endocytosed dietary cholesterol playing a pivotal role in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis. While gaps remain in our understanding of intracellular dietary cholesterol transport, a highly complex network of pathways is starting to emerge, often involving inter-dependent vesicular and non-vesicular transport mechanisms. The last decade has seen a surge in interest in non-vesicular transport and inter-organellar communication at membrane contact sites. By providing platforms for protein interactions, signalling events, lipid exchange and calcium flux, membrane contact sites (MCS) are now appreciated as controlling the fate of large amounts of lipid and play central roles in the regulation and co-ordination of endocytic trafficking. Here, we review the role of MCS in multiple pathways for cholesterol export from the endocytic pathway and highlight the intriguing interplay between vesicular and non-vesicular transport mechanisms and relationship with neurodegenerative disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cholesterol homeostasis", "cholesterol transport", "endosome", "inter-organellar", "lysosome", "membrane contact sites", "tethers", "trafficking"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083515701", "SubjectAreas": [["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57216441784": {"Name": "Martello A.", "AuthorID": "57216441784", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7004743246": {"Name": "Eden E.R.", "AuthorID": "7004743246", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7004655499": {"Name": "Platt F.M.", "AuthorID": "7004655499", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Oxford"}}}
