Complex biological, social, behavioral and structural factors, as well as cultural norms contribute to whether and how young people perceive, are aware of and experience diverse HIV interventions. This qualitative study explored experiences and perceptions of intervention types among adolescents and young adults, and how different interventions could hinder or facilitate HIV treatment and prevention for adolescents and young adults in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Data were collected as part of a DREAMS impact evaluation at the Africa Health Research Institute, KwaZulu-Natal between May 2017\u2013January 2018. We used a combination of rapid community mapping and participant observation in four communities, 58 individual interviews, and 10 group discussions with 61 participants, conducted with both adolescent girls and young women and adolescent boys and young men. Thematic analysis focused on the changing HIV prevention landscape as experienced by adolescents and young adults. Participants reported a mix of new and old biomedical, behavioral, traditional, and locally-developed HIV prevention approaches. The appeal of the newer approaches depended on the extent to which they resonated with existing traditional and longstanding HIV prevention methods and the extent to which they engaged with adolescents and young adults' sexual experiences and with the social and structural factors including gender-related issues. These data demonstrate that in this context, newer methods and approaches can and should synergise with existing methods and beliefs. The HIV prevention landscape is evolving rapidly. Good community links and engagement offer an alternative support structure that could embrace both locally-developed approaches and traditional practices This structure could potentially support feasibility and acceptability of new and old HIV prevention approaches, without creating an impression that new approaches always need to replace the old.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adolescents", "HIV interventions", "HIV prevention landscape", "rural KwaZulu-Natal", "South Africa"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075972937", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"56611942200": {"Name": "Zuma T.", "AuthorID": "56611942200", "AffiliationID": "60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute"}, "57210784629": {"Name": "Seeley J.", "AuthorID": "57210784629", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57212140754": {"Name": "Sibiya L.O.", "AuthorID": "57212140754", "AffiliationID": "60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute"}, "53866161900": {"Name": "Chimbindi N.", "AuthorID": "53866161900", "AffiliationID": "60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute"}, "7006172333": {"Name": "Shahmanesh M.", "AuthorID": "7006172333", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute for Global Health"}, "23396079800": {"Name": "Birdthistle I.", "AuthorID": "23396079800", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "35847280700": {"Name": "Sherr L.", "AuthorID": "35847280700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute for Global Health"}}}
