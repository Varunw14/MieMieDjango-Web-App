The beliefs in arguments are represented by probability distributions and influences between arguments are represented by logical constraints on these probability distributions. This allows for various kinds of influence to be represented including supporting, attacking, and mixed, and it allows for aggregation of influence to be captured, in a context-sensitive way. In this paper, we investigate methods for learning constraints, and thereby the nature of influences, from data. We evaluate our approach by showing that we can obtain constraints with reasonable quality from two publicly available studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Learning for argumentation", "Non-normative argumentation", "Probabilistic argumentation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Context sensitive", "Logical constraints"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092374916", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"7402779550": {"Name": "Hunter A.", "AuthorID": "7402779550", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
