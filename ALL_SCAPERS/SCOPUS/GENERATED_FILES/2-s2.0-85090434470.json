The story has been told and re-told but remained one of \u2018mystery\u2019 into the early 21st-century. When the expedition\u2019s two ships were finally located, the narrative shifted with the reappearance of long-absent objects and materials \u2013 in turn, posing challenges for museum curators seeking to re-present the story. In this article, we conduct a side-by-side examination of two sites: the 1845 Franklin expedition in the Northwest Passage and the 2017 Death in the Ice exhibition at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, UK. We juxtapose these to consider the forces unleashed by the ships\u2019 absence and their presence-ing first in Victorian times and then in the UK museum space today. By analysing the sites through the concept of \u2018absent presence\u2019, the agency of both the material and the immaterial is powerfully highlighted. Via an emphasis on the relation of the absent presence to the sensing bodies of others, we consider the concept as simultaneous and co-constitutive. That is, absence and presence ought to be understood not as objective states, but as becoming-absent and becoming-present: processes that are dependent on curated and embodied sensibilities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["absent presence", "affect", "Arctic", "colonialism", "materiality", "museums"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090434470", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Environmental Science (miscellaneous)", "ENVI", "2301"]], "AuthorData": {"56380635000": {"Name": "Medby I.A.", "AuthorID": "56380635000", "AffiliationID": "60014564", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Brookes University"}, "10139031000": {"Name": "Dittmer J.", "AuthorID": "10139031000", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
