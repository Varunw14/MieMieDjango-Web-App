While socioeconomic inequalities in BP are well documented, it remains unclear (1) how these inequalities have changed across time, given improvements over time in the detection and treatment of high BP (hypertension); (2) whether BP inequalities are present below and above hypertension treatment thresholds; and (3) whether socioeconomic position (SEP) across life has cumulative effects on BP. We sought to address these gaps using evidence from two complementary sources: birth cohort and repeated cross-sectional datasets. Methods: We used three British birth cohort studies\u2014born in 1946, 1958, and 1970\u2014with BP measured at 43\u201346 years (in 1989, 2003, and 2016), and 21 repeated cross-sectional datasets\u2014the Health Survey for England (HSE), with BP measured among adults aged \u2265 25 years (1994\u20132016). Adult education attainment was used as an indicator of SEP in both datasets; childhood father\u2019s social class was used as an alternative indicator of (early life) SEP in cohorts. Adjusting for the expected average effects of antihypertensive medication use, we used linear regression to quantify SEP differences in mean systolic BP (SBP), and quantile regression to investigate whether inequalities differed across SBP distributions\u2014below and above hypertension treatment thresholds. Results: In both datasets, lower educational attainment was associated with higher SBP, with similar absolute magnitudes of inequality across the studied period. Differences in SBP by education (Slope Index of Inequality) based on HSE data were 3.0 mmHg (95% CI 1.8, 4.2) in 1994 and 4.3 mmHg (2.3, 6.3) in 2016. Findings were similar for diastolic BP (DBP) and survey-defined hypertension. Inequalities were found across the SBP distribution in both datasets\u2014below and above the hypertension threshold\u2014yet were larger at the upper tail; in HSE, median SBP differences were 2.8 mmHg (1.7, 3.9) yet 5.6 mmHg (4.9, 6.4) at the 90th quantile. Adjustment for antihypertensive medication use had little impact on the magnitude of inequalities; in contrast, associations were largely attenuated after adjustment for body mass index. Finally, cohort data suggested that disadvantage in early and adult life had cumulative independent associations with BP: cohort-pooled differences in SBP were 5.0 mmHg (3.8, 6.1) in a score combining early life social class and own education, yet were 3.4 mmHg (2.4, 4.4) for education alone. Conclusion: Socioeconomic inequalities in BP have persisted from 1989 to 2016 in Britain/England, despite improved detection and treatment of high BP. To achieve future reductions in BP inequalities, policies addressing the wider structural determinants of high BP levels are likely required, particularly those curtailing the obesogenic environment\u2014targeting detection and treatment alone is unlikely to be sufficient.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blood pressure", "Hypertension", "Social determinants of health", "Socioeconomic inequality"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096130772", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55790281500": {"Name": "Bann D.", "AuthorID": "55790281500", "AffiliationID": "60117701, 60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Longitudinal Studies, Social Research Institute, University College London"}, "56392959200": {"Name": "Fluharty M.", "AuthorID": "56392959200", "AffiliationID": "60117701, 60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Longitudinal Studies, Social Research Institute, University College London"}, "57204025615": {"Name": "Hardy R.", "AuthorID": "57204025615", "AffiliationID": "60117701, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "CLOSER, Social Research Institute, University College London"}, "35363010600": {"Name": "Scholes S.", "AuthorID": "35363010600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
