All rights reserved.Through a global and interdisciplinary lens, this book discusses, analyzes and summarizes the novel conservation approach of rewilding. The volume introduces key rewilding definitions and initiatives, highlighting their similarities and differences. It reviews matches and mismatches between the current state of ecological knowledge and the stated aims of rewilding projects, and discusses the role of human action in rewilding initiatives. Collating current scholarship, the book also considers the merits and dangers of rewilding approaches, as well as the economic and socio-political realities of using rewilding as a conservation tool. Its interdisciplinary nature will appeal to a broad range of readers, from primary ecologists and conservation biologists to land managers, policy makers and conservation practitioners in NGOs and government departments. Written for a scientifically literate readership of academics, researchers, students, and managers, the book also acts as a key resource for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85098448097", "SubjectAreas": [["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"]], "AuthorData": {"8536629700": {"Name": "Pettorelli N.", "AuthorID": "8536629700", "AffiliationID": "60009498, 60005453", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "7003589897": {"Name": "Durant S.M.", "AuthorID": "7003589897", "AffiliationID": "60009498, 60005453", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "7006765736": {"Name": "du Toit J.T.", "AuthorID": "7006765736", "AffiliationID": "60031706", "AffiliationName": "Utah State University"}}}
