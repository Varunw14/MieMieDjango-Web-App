Decompressive craniectomy has been recommended as a surgical procedure for the management of swollen brain and intracranial hypertension. Proper location and size of a decompressive craniectomy, however, remain controversial and no clinical guidelines are available. Mathematical and computational (in silico) models can predict the optimum geometric conditions and provide insights for the brain mechanical response following a decompressive craniectomy. In this work, we present a finite element model of post-traumatic brain injury and decompressive craniectomy that incorporates a biphasic, nonlinear biomechanical model of the brain. A homogenous pressure is applied in the brain to represent the intracranial pressure loading caused by the tissue swelling and the models calculate the deformations and stresses in the brain as well as the herniated volume of the brain tissue that exits the skull following craniectomy. Simulations for different craniectomy geometries (unilateral, bifrontal and bifrontal with midline bar) and sizes are employed to identify optimal clinical conditions of decompressive craniectomy. The reported results for the herniated volume of the brain tissue as a function of the intracranial pressure loading under a specific geometry and size of craniectomy are exceptionally relevant for decompressive craniectomy planning.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094659698", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57219669801": {"Name": "Lambride C.", "AuthorID": "57219669801", "AffiliationID": "60071343", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, University of Cyprus"}, "35361449400": {"Name": "Christodoulou N.", "AuthorID": "35361449400", "AffiliationID": "60071343", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, University of Cyprus"}, "57219671256": {"Name": "Michail A.", "AuthorID": "57219671256", "AffiliationID": "60071343", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, University of Cyprus"}, "6504821984": {"Name": "Vavourakis V.", "AuthorID": "6504821984", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "8420493600": {"Name": "Stylianopoulos T.", "AuthorID": "8420493600", "AffiliationID": "60071343", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, University of Cyprus"}}}
