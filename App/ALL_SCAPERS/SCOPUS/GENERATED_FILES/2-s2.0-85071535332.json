This contribution introduces a multi-method corpus analysis tool, specifically conceived for scientific corpuses with spatialised content. We propose a dedicated interactive application that integrates three strategies for building semantic networks, using keywords (self-declared themes), citations (areas of research using the papers) and full-texts (themes derived from the words used in writing). The networks can be studied with respect to their temporal evolution as well as to their spatial expressions, by considering the countries studied in the papers under inquiry. The tool is applied as a proof-of-concept on the papers published in the online open access geography journal Cybergeo since its creation in 1996. Finally, we compare the three methods and conclude that their complementarity can help go beyond simple statistics to better understand the epistemological evolution of a scientific community and the readership target of the journal. Our tool can be applied by any journal on its own corpus, fostering thus open science and reflexivity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bibliometrics", "epistemology", "Geography of science", "networks", "open science"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071535332", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"], ["Architecture", "ENGI", "2216"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"], ["Nature and Landscape Conservation", "ENVI", "2309"]], "AuthorData": {"57193993383": {"Name": "Raimbault J.", "AuthorID": "57193993383", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "CASA, UCL"}, "57210821782": {"Name": "Chasset P.O.", "AuthorID": "57210821782", "AffiliationID": "60116751", "AffiliationName": "LISER"}, "54392627400": {"Name": "Cottineau C.", "AuthorID": "54392627400", "AffiliationID": "60105776", "AffiliationName": "UMR CNRS 8097 Centre Maurice Halbwachs"}, "55634706200": {"Name": "Commenges H.", "AuthorID": "55634706200", "AffiliationID": "60123629", "AffiliationName": "UMR CNRS 8504 G\u00e9ographie-cit\u00e9s"}, "7004221991": {"Name": "Pumain D.", "AuthorID": "7004221991", "AffiliationID": "60123629", "AffiliationName": "UMR CNRS 8504 G\u00e9ographie-cit\u00e9s"}, "23469622000": {"Name": "Kosmopoulos C.", "AuthorID": "23469622000", "AffiliationID": "60123629", "AffiliationName": "UMR CNRS 8504 G\u00e9ographie-cit\u00e9s"}, "23468703800": {"Name": "Banos A.", "AuthorID": "23468703800", "AffiliationID": "60122745", "AffiliationName": "UMR IDEES 6266"}}}
