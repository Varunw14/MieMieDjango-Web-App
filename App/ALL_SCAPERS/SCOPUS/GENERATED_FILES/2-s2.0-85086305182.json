However, in practical conditions, inevitable high discharge of VOC and dust particles in the common spraying method could be very harmful to the environment and workers as well. Herein, modified silica nanoparticles were combined with a commercial PDMS to obtain a non-fluoride transparent superhydrophobic coating cured at ambient temperature via an environment-friendly method of brushing. The coating can be fabricated on a wide range of substrates in a short time of only two minutes. The coating demonstrated excellent thermal stability upto 360 \u00b0C and corrosion resistance in electrochemical testing. Owing to the short fabrication process, the coating can be readily repaired by prompt brushing after being destroyed. With ultra-easy fabrication, it is expected that the coating has a great potential for practical application with different requirements such as low pollutant discharge, high transmittance, good thermostability or corrosion resistance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brush-coating", "Fluorine-free", "Rapid fabrication", "Superhydrophobic", "Transparency"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electrochemical testing", "Environment friendly", "Fabrication process", "High transmittance", "Pollutant discharges", "Rapid fabrication", "Superhydrophobic coatings", "Superhydrophobic materials"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086305182", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57208349286": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "57208349286", "AffiliationID": "60028265, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Magnetism and Magnetic Materials of the Ministry of Education, School of Physical Science and Technology, Lanzhou University"}, "57207258941": {"Name": "Wang H.", "AuthorID": "57207258941", "AffiliationID": "60028265, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Magnetism and Magnetic Materials of the Ministry of Education, School of Physical Science and Technology, Lanzhou University"}, "57207261421": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "57207261421", "AffiliationID": "60028265, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Magnetism and Magnetic Materials of the Ministry of Education, School of Physical Science and Technology, Lanzhou University"}, "8664547300": {"Name": "Men X.", "AuthorID": "8664547300", "AffiliationID": "60028265, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Magnetism and Magnetic Materials of the Ministry of Education, School of Physical Science and Technology, Lanzhou University"}, "57193532781": {"Name": "Wang M.", "AuthorID": "57193532781", "AffiliationID": "60011549, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Solid Lubrication, Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "13403796100": {"Name": "Zhang Z.", "AuthorID": "13403796100", "AffiliationID": "60011549, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Solid Lubrication, Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "57217715360": {"Name": "Singh V.", "AuthorID": "57217715360", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Nanoengineered Systems Laboratory, UCL Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
