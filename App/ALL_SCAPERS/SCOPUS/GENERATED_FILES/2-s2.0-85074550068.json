Sudan first reported trachoma in the 1930s and has since been consistently endemic. Ocular C. trachomatis previously isolated from trachoma patients in Sudan in 1963 was antigenically identical to an isolate from Saudi Arabia (A/SA1). No contemporary ocular C. trachomatis whole genome sequences have been reported from Sudan. Methods: This study sequenced twenty ocular C. trachomatis isolates to improve understanding of pathogen diversity in North-East Africa and examine for genomic variation specific to Sudan, possibly related to the persistence of trachoma in surveyed communities. High quality, whole genome sequences were obtained from 12/20 isolates. Results: All isolates were serovar A and had tarP and trpA sequences typical of classical, ocular C. trachomatis isolates. The Sudanese isolates formed a closely related subclade within the T2-trachoma clade of C. trachomatis phylogeny distinct from geographically disparate ocular isolates, with little intra-population diversity. We found 333 SNPs that were conserved in Sudanese ocular isolates but rare compared to other ocular C. trachomatis populations, which were focused in two genomic loci (CTA0172-CTA0173 and CTA0482). Conclusions: Limited intra-population diversity and geographical clustering of ocular C. trachomatis suggests minimal transmission between and slow diversification within trachoma-endemic communities. However, diversity may have been higher pre-treatment in these communities. Over-representation of Sudan-specific SNPs in three genes suggests they may have an impact on C. trachomatis growth and transmission in this population.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chlamydia trachomatis", "Genomics", "Ocular", "Trachoma", "Whole-genome sequencing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Azithromycin", "Child, Preschool", "Chlamydia trachomatis", "Conjunctiva", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "DNA, Bacterial", "Gene Frequency", "Genome, Bacterial", "Genomic Structural Variation", "Humans", "Infant", "Likelihood Functions", "Phylogeny", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Sudan", "Trachoma", "Whole Genome Sequencing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074550068", "SubjectAreas": [["Parasitology", "IMMU", "2405"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57211589956": {"Name": "Alkhidir A.A.I.", "AuthorID": "57211589956", "AffiliationID": "60071741", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Omdurman Islamic University"}, "57211589836": {"Name": "El Hussain K.M.K.", "AuthorID": "57211589836", "AffiliationID": "60071741", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Omdurman Islamic University"}, "57211063799": {"Name": "Ournasseir M.E.H.", "AuthorID": "57211063799", "AffiliationID": "60071741", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Omdurman Islamic University"}, "7201661621": {"Name": "Holland M.J.", "AuthorID": "7201661621", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research Department, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57189762228": {"Name": "Pickering H.", "AuthorID": "57189762228", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research Department, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "35111161800": {"Name": "Elhag W.I.", "AuthorID": "35111161800", "AffiliationID": "60071732", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Al-Neelain University"}, "57205315036": {"Name": "Williams C.A.", "AuthorID": "57205315036", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "55498702100": {"Name": "Breuer J.", "AuthorID": "55498702100", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Microbiology Virology, and Infection Control, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57211589988": {"Name": "Elemam A.E.", "AuthorID": "57211589988", "AffiliationID": "60071726, 60071723", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Endemic Diseases, University of Khartoum"}}}
