Although many user-generated geotagged sources exist, landmark entities are still mostly retrieved from authoritative geographic sources. Wikipedia, the world\u2019s largest free encyclopedia, stores geotagged information on many geospatial entities, including a very large and well-founded volume of landmark information. However, not all Wikipedia geotagged landmark entities can be considered valuable and instructive. This research introduces an integrated ranking model for mining landmarks from Wikipedia predicated on estimating and weighting their salience. Other than location, the model is based on the entries\u2019 category and attributed data. Preliminary ranking is formulated on the basis of three spatial descriptors associated with landmark salience, namely permanence, visibility, and uniqueness. This ranking is integrated with a score derived from a set of numerical attributes that are associated with public interest in the Wikipedia page\u2014including the number of redirects and the date of the latest edit. The methodology is comparatively evaluated for various areas in different cities. Results show that the developed integrated ranking model is robust in identifying landmark salience, paving the way for incorporation of Wikipedia\u2019s content into navigation systems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Data mining", "Landmark salience", "Spatial cognition", "User-generated content", "Wikipedia"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076683113", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Computers in Earth Sciences", "EART", "1903"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"]], "AuthorData": {"57202621496": {"Name": "Binski N.", "AuthorID": "57202621496", "AffiliationID": "60022403", "AffiliationName": "Mapping and Geo-Information Engineering, Civil and Environmental Engineering Faculty, Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"}, "25822009300": {"Name": "Dalyot S.", "AuthorID": "25822009300", "AffiliationID": "60022403", "AffiliationName": "Mapping and Geo-Information Engineering, Civil and Environmental Engineering Faculty, Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology"}, "55916324100": {"Name": "Natapov A.", "AuthorID": "55916324100", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment, University College London"}}}
