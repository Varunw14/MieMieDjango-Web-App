Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.Cytoplasmic dynein-2 is a motor protein complex that drives the movement of cargoes along microtubules within cilia, facilitating the assembly of these organelles on the surface of nearly all mammalian cells. Dynein-2 is crucial for ciliary function, as evidenced by deleterious mutations in patients with skeletal abnormalities. Long-standing questions include how the dynein-2 complex is assembled, regulated, and switched between active and inactive states. A combination of model organisms, in vitro cell biology, live-cell imaging, structural biology and biochemistry has advanced our understanding of the dynein-2 motor. In this Cell Science at a Glance article and the accompanying poster, we discuss the current understanding of dynein-2 and its roles in ciliary assembly and function.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cilia", "Dynein-2", "Intraflagellar transport", "Microtubule motors"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082791193", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57219829792": {"Name": "Vuolo L.", "AuthorID": "57219829792", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Cell Biology Laboratories, School of Biochemistry, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "56432508900": {"Name": "Stevenson N.L.", "AuthorID": "56432508900", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Cell Biology Laboratories, School of Biochemistry, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "7402939536": {"Name": "Stephens D.J.", "AuthorID": "7402939536", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Cell Biology Laboratories, School of Biochemistry, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "56915293800": {"Name": "Mukhopadhyay A.G.", "AuthorID": "56915293800", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Department of Biological Sciences, University of London"}, "56283028900": {"Name": "Roberts A.J.", "AuthorID": "56283028900", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Department of Biological Sciences, University of London"}}}
