Different intestinal crypt populations dedifferentiate to provide new ISCs, but the transcriptional and signaling trajectories that guide this process are unclear, and a large body of work suggests that quiescent \u201creserve\u201d ISCs contribute to regeneration. By timing the interval between LGR5+ lineage tracing and lethal injury, we show that ISC regeneration is explained nearly completely by dedifferentiation, with contributions from absorptive and secretory progenitors. The ISC-restricted transcription factor ASCL2 confers measurable competitive advantage to resting ISCs and is essential to restore the ISC compartment. Regenerating cells re-express Ascl2 days before Lgr5, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses reveal transcriptional paths underlying dedifferentiation. ASCL2 target genes include the interleukin-11 (IL-11) receptor Il11ra1, and recombinant IL-11 enhances crypt cell regenerative potential. These findings reveal cell dedifferentiation as the principal means for ISC restoration and highlight an ASCL2-regulated signal that enables this adaptive response. Quiescent reserve \u201c+4 crypt cells\u201d are thought to be a major source for recovery of ablated intestinal stem cells. Shivdasani et al. show instead that recovery occurs almost exclusively by dedifferentiation of recent stem cell progeny, which requires the transcription factor ASCL2 for this restorative potential.", "AuthorKeywords": ["facultative stem cells", "reserve stem cells", "stem cell dedifferentiation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85080041644", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57194601347": {"Name": "Murata K.", "AuthorID": "57194601347", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Medicine, Brigham & Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School"}, "8256184000": {"Name": "Jadhav U.", "AuthorID": "8256184000", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Medicine, Brigham & Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School"}, "56960653000": {"Name": "Madha S.", "AuthorID": "56960653000", "AffiliationID": "60014334", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology and Center for Functional Cancer Epigenetics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"}, "55365170800": {"Name": "Cavazza A.", "AuthorID": "55365170800", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Medicine, Brigham & Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School"}, "7006543399": {"Name": "Shivdasani R.A.", "AuthorID": "7006543399", "AffiliationID": "60027452", "AffiliationName": "Harvard Stem Cell Institute"}, "7005206137": {"Name": "van Es J.", "AuthorID": "7005206137", "AffiliationID": "60031066, 60032724, 60014578", "AffiliationName": "Hubrecht Institute, Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW) and University Medical Centre (UMC) Utrecht"}, "35594209900": {"Name": "Clevers H.", "AuthorID": "35594209900", "AffiliationID": "60031066, 60032724, 60014578", "AffiliationName": "Hubrecht Institute, Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW) and University Medical Centre (UMC) Utrecht"}, "57214494328": {"Name": "Dean J.", "AuthorID": "57214494328", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard University"}, "57217425994": {"Name": "Michor F.", "AuthorID": "57217425994", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard University"}, "7006355338": {"Name": "Wucherpfennig K.", "AuthorID": "7006355338", "AffiliationID": "60014334", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer Immunology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"}}}
