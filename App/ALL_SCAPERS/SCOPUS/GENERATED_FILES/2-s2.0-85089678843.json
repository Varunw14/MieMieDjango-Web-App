In this work, an efficient and precise reactive discrete Boltzmann method is employed to investigate the impact of the amplitude and wave length of the initial perturbation, as well as of the chemical heat on the evolution of unsteady detonation with nonequilibrium effects. It is shown that the initial perturbation amplitude only affects the unsteady detonation in the early period, and the detonation becomes self-similar with minor phase differences later on. For small wave lengths, the pressure increases faster with a higher oscillation frequency in the early period, but decreases soon afterwards. With increasing chemical heat release, the pressure and its oscillations increase, and the nonequilibrium effects become more pronounced, but the oscillatory period decreases. When the wave length or chemical heat release is small enough, there is no transverse wave or cellular pattern, and the two-dimensional unsteady detonation reduces to the one-dimensional case.", "AuthorKeywords": ["thermodynamic nonequilibrium", "unsteady detonation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Boltzmann methods", "Cellular pattern", "Initial perturbation", "Kinetic simulation", "Non-equilibrium effects", "Oscillation frequency", "Pressure increase", "Thermodynamic non-equilibrium"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089678843", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"35337043800": {"Name": "Lin C.", "AuthorID": "35337043800", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "Sino-French Institute of Nuclear Engineering and Technology, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "7102436109": {"Name": "Luo K.H.", "AuthorID": "7102436109", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
