All rights reserved.In this paper, a centralized control system is designed for the two HAUVs undertaking underwater transportation of a spherical payload via cylindrical manipulators. First, the nonlinear coupled dynamic model is developed considering the rigid body connection method for transportation. The effect of the hydrodynamic, hydrostatic and thrust parameters are taken about the centre of the combined body i.e. the centre of payload. Path trajectory is generated using the minimum snap trajectory algorithm. The trajectory is divided into segments for each directional motion which is further divided into the waypoints based on the time step of the duration. The path between two waypoints is represented by a 7th order polynomial. The centralized control system is designed to follow the desired trajectory. The control system is designed using PID controllers for the motion control in each direction. The main technical requirements are the stability of the payload, accurate trajectory tracking and robustness to overcome uncertainties. Stability cannot be compromised because of the rigid connection between the vehicles and the payload, whereas, tracking is given a tolerance of \u00b15%. Transportation task is observed for the desired motion in the horizontal plane. The time domain motion simulation results show that the desired trajectory has been accurately followed by the combined system while meeting the technical requirements.", "AuthorKeywords": ["hydrodynamics", "Nonlinear coupled dynamic model", "path trajectory", "PID controller", "Rigid body connection", "tracking", "waypoints"], "IndexKeywords": ["Centralized control systems", "Coupled dynamics", "Desired trajectories", "PID controllers", "Rigid body", "Technical requirement", "Trajectory tracking", "Waypoints"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076255323", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"]], "AuthorData": {"57213801492": {"Name": "Rehman F.", "AuthorID": "57213801492", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "25925551300": {"Name": "Thomas G.", "AuthorID": "25925551300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57191408791": {"Name": "Anderlini E.", "AuthorID": "57191408791", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
