Unlike the fingers, represented in all primates, individuated toe maps have only been found in non-human primates. Using 1-mm resolution fMRI, we identify organized toe maps in two individuals born without either upper limb who use their feet to substitute missing hand function and even support their profession as foot artists. We demonstrate that the ordering and structure of the artists\u2019 toe representation mimics typical hand representation. We further reveal \u201chand-like\u201d features of activity patterns, not only in the foot area but also similarly in the missing hand area. We suggest humans may have an innate capacity for forming additional topographic maps that can be expressed with appropriate experience.\u00a9 2019 The Author(s)We investigate two foot artists, born without arms, asking if a lifetime of radically altered bodily experience can cause new body maps in the brain. We provide evidence that complex toe behavior supports organized \u201chand-like\u201d activity in the artists\u2019 foot and (missing) hand areas, significantly more so than in controls.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adaptive", "amputees", "deprivation", "ecological behavior", "fMRI", "hand", "plasticity", "reorganization", "sensorimotor", "somatotopy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain Mapping", "Foot", "Hand", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Motor Cortex", "Neuronal Plasticity", "Physical Stimulation", "Software", "Somatosensory Cortex", "Toes", "Touch Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071728804", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"56106255800": {"Name": "Dempsey-Jones H.", "AuthorID": "56106255800", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "57205668131": {"Name": "Wesselink D.B.", "AuthorID": "57205668131", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging, University of Oxford"}, "15835219200": {"Name": "Makin T.R.", "AuthorID": "15835219200", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "9337239400": {"Name": "Friedman J.", "AuthorID": "9337239400", "AffiliationID": "60005681", "AffiliationName": "Sagol School of Neuroscience, Tel Aviv University"}}}
