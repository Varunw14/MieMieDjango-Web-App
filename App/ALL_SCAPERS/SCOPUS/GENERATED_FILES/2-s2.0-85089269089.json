Interestingly, all new compounds (2a-2i) showed potent cell-based antiproliferative activities in nanomolar concentrations. Among the compounds, 2a, 2b and 2e were the most active across three cancer cell lines. In addition, these compounds inhibited the polymerisation of tubulin in vitro more efficiently than CA-4. They caused cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase further confirming their ability to inhibit tubulin polymerisation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer", "Combretastatin A-4", "Microtubules", "Tubulin"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089269089", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"57218477966": {"Name": "Barnes N.G.", "AuthorID": "57218477966", "AffiliationID": "60008250", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Centre, Kidscan Laboratories, School of Science, Engineering and Environment, University of Salford"}, "57218476063": {"Name": "Ahmed Mal Ullah A.A.", "AuthorID": "57218476063", "AffiliationID": "60008250", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Centre, Kidscan Laboratories, School of Science, Engineering and Environment, University of Salford"}, "14071829900": {"Name": "Ragazzon P.A.", "AuthorID": "14071829900", "AffiliationID": "60008250", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Centre, Kidscan Laboratories, School of Science, Engineering and Environment, University of Salford"}, "7006234461": {"Name": "Hadfield J.A.", "AuthorID": "7006234461", "AffiliationID": "60008250", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Centre, Kidscan Laboratories, School of Science, Engineering and Environment, University of Salford"}, "7403267977": {"Name": "Parker A.W.", "AuthorID": "7403267977", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Central Laser Facility, Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, STFC"}}}
