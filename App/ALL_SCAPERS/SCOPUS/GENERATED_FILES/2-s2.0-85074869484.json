Malondialdehyde (MDA), a lipid peroxidation marker, and ascorbate, a marker of antioxidant status, can represent early indicators of this process within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We hypothesized that changes in cerebral lipid peroxidation can be measured ex vivo following neurosurgery in children. Methods: Thirty-six children (M:F = 19/17, median age 32.9 months; IQR 17.6\u201374.6) undergoing neurosurgery for brain tumor removal were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in the postoperative period with an indwelling intraventricular catheter for intracranial pressure monitoring and CSF drainage. Plasma and CSF samples were obtained for serial measurement of MDA, ascorbate, and cytokines. Results: An early brain-limited increase in lipid peroxidation was measured, with a significant increase from baseline of MDA in CSF (p = 0.007) but not in plasma. In parallel, ascorbate in CSF decreased (p = 0.05). Systemic inflammatory response following brain surgery was evidenced by plasma IL-6/IL-8 increase (p 0.0022 and 0.0106, respectively). No correlation was found between oxidative response and tumor site or histology (according to World Health Organization grading). Similarly, lipid peroxidation was unrelated to the length of surgery (mean 321 \u00b1 73 min), or intraoperative blood loss (mean 20.9 \u00b1 16.8% of preoperative volemia, 44% given hemotransfusions). Median PICU stay was 3.5 days (IQL range 2\u20135.5 d.), and postoperative ventilation need was 24 h (IQL range 20\u201361.5 h). The elevation in postoperative MDA in CSF compared with preoperative values correlated significantly with postoperative ventilation need (P = 0.05, r2 0168), while no difference in PICU stay was recorded. Conclusions: Our results indicate that lipid peroxidation increases consistently following brain surgery, and it is accompanied by a decrease in antioxidant defences; intraventricular catheterization offers a unique chance of oxidative process monitoring. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether monitoring post-neurosurgical oxidative stress in CSF is of prognostic utility.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antioxidant activity", "Brain injury", "Lipid peroxidation", "Pediatric intensive care", "Pediatric neurosurgery"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074869484", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"]], "AuthorData": {"7003629588": {"Name": "Piastra M.", "AuthorID": "7003629588", "AffiliationID": "60031984", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Anesthesia/Intensive Care, Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore"}, "55899180200": {"Name": "Caresta E.", "AuthorID": "55899180200", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Pediatrics, Sapienza University"}, "55912507400": {"Name": "Picconi E.", "AuthorID": "55912507400", "AffiliationID": "60073799", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS"}, "55074518200": {"Name": "Luca E.", "AuthorID": "55074518200", "AffiliationID": "60073799", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS"}, "57188586913": {"Name": "Morena T.C.", "AuthorID": "57188586913", "AffiliationID": "60073799", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS"}, "56186790200": {"Name": "Conti G.", "AuthorID": "56186790200", "AffiliationID": "60073799", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS"}, "55572871400": {"Name": "Massimi L.", "AuthorID": "55572871400", "AffiliationID": "60073799", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Neurosurgery, Department of Neurosurgery, Fondazione Policlinico Gemelli IRCCS"}, "7102181886": {"Name": "Eaton S.", "AuthorID": "7102181886", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Surgery, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}}}
