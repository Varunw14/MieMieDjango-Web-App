This study aimed to extract concerns that must be considered for perinatal women's mental healthcare in postdisaster settings based on lessons from the Great East Japan Earthquake. Narrative messages regarding protective and risk factors for mothers' mental health from a representative population of mothers who had given birth and all official maternal caregivers, in a coastal town devastated by the catastrophe were subjected to qualitative analyses. Eight concerns were extracted as specific support needs: (1) improve information pathways, (2) maintain access to medical services, (3) sufficiently equip necessary items for perinatal women and children, (4) implement hygienic facilities, (5) prevent mothers from feeling diffidence, (6) encourage mothers to focus on positive aspects of being pregnant or taking care of their babies, (7) provide dedicated paths for relief supply distribution and dedicated rooms for mothers and children in shelters, and (8) resume usual healthcare activities as soon as possible. The comprehensive survey of the affected community presented concerns that needed to be considered for perinatal women's mental health in postdisaster settings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Disaster", "Healthcare provider", "Mental health", "Perinatal women", "Qualitative analysis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088967236", "SubjectAreas": [["Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology", "EART", "1909"], ["Safety Research", "SOCI", "3311"], ["Geology", "EART", "1907"]], "AuthorData": {"55801746700": {"Name": "Kobayashi N.", "AuthorID": "55801746700", "AffiliationID": "60016416", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatric Nursing, Tohoku University School of Medicine"}, "57210831147": {"Name": "Seto M.", "AuthorID": "57210831147", "AffiliationID": "60016416", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Tohoku University School of Medicine"}, "23497395100": {"Name": "Kikuchi S.", "AuthorID": "23497395100", "AffiliationID": "60016416", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Tohoku University School of Medicine"}, "24399055100": {"Name": "Honda N.", "AuthorID": "24399055100", "AffiliationID": "60016416", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Tohoku University School of Medicine"}, "7401586890": {"Name": "Matsuoka H.", "AuthorID": "7401586890", "AffiliationID": "60016416", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Tohoku University School of Medicine"}, "35391757000": {"Name": "Tomita H.", "AuthorID": "35391757000", "AffiliationID": "60008435", "AffiliationName": "Department of Preventive Medicine and Epidemiology, Tohoku Medical Megabank Organisation, Tohoku University"}, "56560421800": {"Name": "Sato K.", "AuthorID": "56560421800", "AffiliationID": "60016416", "AffiliationName": "Department of Maternal Nursing, Tohoku University School of Medicine"}, "57200687160": {"Name": "Nemoto H.", "AuthorID": "57200687160", "AffiliationID": "60008435", "AffiliationName": "Department of Disaster Psychiatry, International Research Institute of Disaster Science"}, "57218170380": {"Name": "Suzuki T.", "AuthorID": "57218170380", "AffiliationID": "60008435", "AffiliationName": "Department of Disaster Psychiatry, International Research Institute of Disaster Science"}, "55217878300": {"Name": "Sato S.", "AuthorID": "55217878300", "AffiliationID": "60008435", "AffiliationName": "Department of Disaster Digital Archive, International Research Institute of Disaster Science"}, "7005383572": {"Name": "Imamura F.", "AuthorID": "7005383572", "AffiliationID": "60008435", "AffiliationName": "Department of Disaster Digital Archive, International Research Institute of Disaster Science"}, "55573567800": {"Name": "Ito K.", "AuthorID": "55573567800", "AffiliationID": "60008435", "AffiliationName": "Department of Community Medical Support, Tohoku Medical Megabank Organisation, Tohoku University"}, "35474685900": {"Name": "Sugawara J.", "AuthorID": "35474685900", "AffiliationID": "60008435", "AffiliationName": "Department of Community Medical Support, Tohoku Medical Megabank Organisation, Tohoku University"}, "57194681979": {"Name": "Kayano R.", "AuthorID": "57194681979", "AffiliationID": "60027142", "AffiliationName": "World Health Organization Centre for Health Development, I.H.D.
