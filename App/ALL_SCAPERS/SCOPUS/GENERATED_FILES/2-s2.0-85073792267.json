As such, research is needed to better determine risks factors for e-cigarette use. Accumulating evidence suggests that attitudes toward e-cigarette use could be a potential risk factor for e-cigarette use. Objectives: This study sought to examine the psychometric properties of the Comparing E-cigarette And Cigarette questionnaire (CEAC), and to replicate a structural model of the relationship between impulsive-related personality traits and e-cigarette use mediated by positive attitudes toward e-cigarettes. Methods: Participants were 525 adults (mean age = 33.42, SD = 11.27) who completed the CEAC and UPPS-P (trait impulsivity) questionnaires online. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis of the CEAC replicated the a priori factor structure of the questionnaire reasonably well (\u03c72(df = 32) =172.85, CFI = 0.94, TLI = 0.91, RMSEA = 0.09 (0.08\u20130.11, 90% Confidence Interval, SRMR = 0.06). Structural path analysis showed that deficits in conscientiousness was significantly negatively related to e-cigarette attitudes (\u03b2 = \u20130.20, p =.01), while urgency (\u03b2 = 0.19, p =.018) showed a significant positive relationship to e-cigarette attitudes. E-cigarette users showed significantly more positive attitudes toward e-cigarettes than nonusers (\u03b2 = 0.59, p <.001). No significant direct effects were found between impulsivity-related traits and e-cigarette use. Conclusions: The present study suggests that impulsivity-related traits and attitudes toward e-cigarettes are likely to be important risk factors for e-cigarette use. Future prospective and experimental studies should test if the causal model described in this study predicts risk for e-cigarette use, and whether this model could therefore be used to guide strategies for reducing risk for e-cigarette use.", "AuthorKeywords": ["attitudes", "e-Cigarette", "impulsivity", "smoking"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Attitude", "Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems", "Female", "Humans", "Impulsive Behavior", "Male", "Psychometrics", "Risk Factors", "Smoking", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Tobacco Products", "Vaping", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073792267", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56448546800": {"Name": "Kale D.", "AuthorID": "56448546800", "AffiliationID": "60010964", "AffiliationName": "Goldsmiths, University of London"}, "7102737202": {"Name": "Pickering A.", "AuthorID": "7102737202", "AffiliationID": "60010964", "AffiliationName": "Goldsmiths, University of London"}, "55539675500": {"Name": "Cooper A.", "AuthorID": "55539675500", "AffiliationID": "60010964", "AffiliationName": "Goldsmiths, University of London"}}}
