Examples of Black Slipped and Grey Slipped Ware sherds from two Greek cities, Issa on the island of Vis and Pharos on the island of Hvar, both of which contain pottery kilns, were analysed via geochemistry and thin section petrography. These data were compared to raw material samples from both islands, fine table ware sherds from the Dalmatian harbour site of Siculi, today Resnik, and legacy chemical data from southern Italy and north-western Greece, based on their typological similarity, in order to shed light on their production locations and distribution. This novel approach to provenience studies of the Hellenistic fine tableware takes into account not only the local provenance of vessels, but tries to locate the place of manufacture of imported vessels and their possible imitations and development within the context of learning. Besides, authors argue that apart of movement of pottery, the raw material was transported via existing maritime routes and used by the two different workshops at the same time. In the amidst extensive Hellenistic trade networks, fine tableware have been produced in Central Dalmatia by emerging local centres in the Greek cities of Issa and Pharos.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Circulation", "Dalmatia", "Fine tableware", "Geochemistry", "Late Hellenistic period", "Local production", "Thin section petrography", "Trade"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090201978", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"36773602000": {"Name": "Mi\u0161e M.", "AuthorID": "36773602000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Archaeology"}, "36459218400": {"Name": "Serneels V.", "AuthorID": "36459218400", "AffiliationID": "60024631", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geosciences, University of Fribourg"}, "22953938100": {"Name": "Quinn P.", "AuthorID": "22953938100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Archaeology"}, "56821144200": {"Name": "Charlton M.", "AuthorID": "56821144200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Archaeology"}, "7101889538": {"Name": "Montanari A.", "AuthorID": "7101889538", "AffiliationID": "125070970", "AffiliationName": "L'Osservatorio Geologico di Coldigioco"}}}
