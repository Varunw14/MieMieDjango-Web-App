The upper critical solution temperature (UCST) of homo-zwitterions can be precisely adjusted by the surrounding pH due to the presence of a carboxyl end-group. Meanwhile, after esterification of the carboxylic acid group by methyl, ethyl, hexyl, phenethyl alcohol, UCST of all resulted PDMAPS with ester terminated groups showed more significant increases. Dynamic light scattering (DLS), Zeta-potential and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) results demonstrated that the ionization/protonation from the carboxylic end-group and hydrophobicity of ester groups contribute significantly to the tunability. This end-group modification technique provides an easy and economical way of synthesizing temperature-responsive homo-polyzwitterions with precise and controllable temperature range owing to the designability of RAFT polymerization, where the products are suitable for biomedical and environmental engineering applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["End-group effects", "RAFT polymerization", "Thermo-responsive", "Zwitterionic polymers"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carboxyl end group", "Carboxylic acid groups", "End-group modification", "One step synthesis", "RAft polymerization", "Reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer", "Synthesizing temperature", "Upper critical solution temperature"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083875762", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Polymers and Plastics", "MATE", "2507"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57204936919": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "57204936919", "AffiliationID": "60021843", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Soft Matter Science and Engineering, College of Materials Science and Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology"}, "57216565301": {"Name": "Hao B.", "AuthorID": "57216565301", "AffiliationID": "60021843", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Soft Matter Science and Engineering, College of Materials Science and Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology"}, "57221071606": {"Name": "Tang Y.", "AuthorID": "57221071606", "AffiliationID": "60021843", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Soft Matter Science and Engineering, College of Materials Science and Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology"}, "57216642088": {"Name": "Li H.", "AuthorID": "57216642088", "AffiliationID": "60021843", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Soft Matter Science and Engineering, College of Materials Science and Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology"}, "55484527700": {"Name": "Feng A.", "AuthorID": "55484527700", "AffiliationID": "60021843", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Organic-Inorganic Composites, Beijing University of Chemical Technology"}, "57196127758": {"Name": "Zhang L.", "AuthorID": "57196127758", "AffiliationID": "60021843", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Organic-Inorganic Composites, Beijing University of Chemical Technology"}, "35119311000": {"Name": "Lee T.C.", "AuthorID": "35119311000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Materials Discovery and Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003618159": {"Name": "Thang S.H.", "AuthorID": "7003618159", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Monash University"}}}
