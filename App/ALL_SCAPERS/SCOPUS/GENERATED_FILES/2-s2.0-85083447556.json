Haemophilia published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Introduction: Turoctocog alfa pegol is a glycoPEGylated recombinant factor VIII (FVIII) with an extended half-life developed for prophylaxis, treatment of bleeds and perioperative management in patients with haemophilia A. Aim: Evaluate the efficacy and safety of turoctocog alfa pegol treatment for major and minor surgeries in the pathfinder 3 and 5 phase III trials. Methods: Adults/adolescents aged \u226512 years with severe haemophilia A (FVIII <1%) received perioperative turoctocog alfa pegol treatment planned to achieve FVIII activity levels >80% during major surgery (pathfinder 3). The primary end point was haemostatic efficacy during surgery; secondary end points were blood loss, haemostatic effect postsurgery, consumption, transfusions, safety and health economics. Children (0-11 years) undergoing minor surgeries received 20-75 IU/kg turoctocog alfa pegol at Investigator's discretion (pathfinder 5). Results: pathfinder 3 included 35 patients undergoing 49 major surgeries. Haemostasis was successful in 47/49 (95.9%) surgeries; two had moderate haemostatic responses. Median (mean) blood loss during major surgery was 75 (322.6) mL. Four bleeds were reported postsurgery; three were successfully treated with turoctocog alfa pegol (one was not evaluated). On the day of surgery, overall mean (median) dose was 75.5 (74.5) IU/kg and mean (median) number of doses was 1.7 (2.0). Five procedures required 11 transfusions on the day of surgery or days 1-6. No safety concerns or inhibitors were identified. Forty-five minor surgeries in 23 children were performed without complications. Conclusion: Turoctocog alfa pegol was effective for perioperative haemostatic management of major and minor surgeries in patients across age groups with severe haemophilia A.", "AuthorKeywords": ["extended half-life", "factor VIII", "haemophilia A", "haemostasis", "surgery", "turoctocog alfa pegol"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Factor VIII", "Female", "Hemophilia A", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Minor Surgical Procedures", "Recombinant Proteins", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083447556", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"7003331981": {"Name": "Tosetto A.", "AuthorID": "7003331981", "AffiliationID": "60025304", "AffiliationName": "Hematology Department, Haemophilia and Thrombosis Center, San Bortolo Hospital"}, "23028227100": {"Name": "Neff A.", "AuthorID": "23028227100", "AffiliationID": "60021160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hematology/Oncology, Cleveland Clinic"}, "57209010337": {"Name": "Lentz S.R.", "AuthorID": "57209010337", "AffiliationID": "60009788", "AffiliationName": "Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Blood & Marrow Transplantation, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine"}, "7004132887": {"Name": "Santagostino E.", "AuthorID": "7004132887", "AffiliationID": "60007067", "AffiliationName": "Fondazione IRCCS C\u00e0 Granda - Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Angelo Bianchi Bonomi Haemophilia and Thrombosis Center"}, "24169312300": {"Name": "Nemes L.", "AuthorID": "24169312300", "AffiliationID": "112600099", "AffiliationName": "National Haemophilia Centre and Haemostasis Department, Medical Centre of Hungarian Defence Forces"}, "23028516700": {"Name": "Sathar J.", "AuthorID": "23028516700", "AffiliationID": "105231882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Ampang Hospital"}, "7004195708": {"Name": "Meijer K.", "AuthorID": "7004195708", "AffiliationID": "60006027, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University Medical Centre Groningen, University of Groningen"}, "57193134405": {"Name": "Chowdary P.", "AuthorID": "57193134405", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Katharine Dormandy Haemophilia and Thrombosis Centre, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57216413754": {"Name": "Shen C.", "AuthorID": "57216413754", "AffiliationID": "60006179", "AffiliationName": "Novo Nordisk A/S"}, "8062078100": {"Name": "Landorph A.", "AuthorID": "8062078100", "AffiliationID": "60006179", "AffiliationName": "Novo Nordisk A/S"}, "7006548945": {"Name": "Hampton K.", "AuthorID": "7006548945", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Science, University of Sheffield"}}}
