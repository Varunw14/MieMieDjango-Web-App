An alternative method for data collection is record linkage; the linking together of electronic health and administrative records. Applied nationally, this could provide unrivalled opportunities to follow a large number of people in perpetuity. However, public attitudes to the use of data in research are currently unclear. Here we report on an event where we collected attitudes towards recent opportunities and controversies within health data science. Methods: The event was attended by ~250 individuals (cohort members and their guests), who had been invited through the offices of their participating cohort studies. There were a series of presentations describing key research results and the audience participated in 15 multiple-choice questions using interactive voting pads. Results: Our participants showed a high level of trust in researchers (87% scoring them 4/5 or 5/5) and doctors (81%); but less trust in commercial companies (35%). They supported the idea of researchers using information from both neonatal blood spots (Guthrie spots) (97% yes) and from electronic health records (95% yes). Our respondents were willing to wear devices like a 'Fit-bit' (78% agreed) or take a brain scan that might predict later mental illness (73%). However, they were less willing to take a new drug for research purposes (45%). They were keen to encourage others to take part in research; whether that be offering the opportunity to pregnant mothers (97% agreed) or extending invitations to their own children and grandchildren (98%). Conclusions: Our participants were broadly supportive of research access to data, albeit less supportive when commercial interests were involved. Public engagement events that facilitate two-way interactions can influence and support future research and public engagement efforts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Big Data", "Cohort", "Data Linkage", "Data Science", "Guthrie", "Health", "Knowledge Exchange", "Opinion", "Public Engagement", "Scotland"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088440496", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"56659456900": {"Name": "Beange I.", "AuthorID": "56659456900", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "57210750701": {"Name": "Kirkham E.J.", "AuthorID": "57210750701", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "24331625300": {"Name": "Fletcher-Watson S.", "AuthorID": "24331625300", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "57189224801": {"Name": "Iveson M.H.", "AuthorID": "57189224801", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "7006525184": {"Name": "Lawrie S.M.", "AuthorID": "7006525184", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "57204151562": {"Name": "Boardman J.P.", "AuthorID": "57204151562", "AffiliationID": "60028299, 60015879, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Centre for Reproductive Health, University of Edinburgh"}, "56208173500": {"Name": "McIntosh A.M.", "AuthorID": "56208173500", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "The Lothian Birth Cohorts, Division of Psychology, University of Edinburgh"}, "7003988354": {"Name": "Batty G.D.", "AuthorID": "7003988354", "AffiliationID": "60013402", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological and Population Health Sciences, Oregon State University"}, "57215886102": {"Name": "Deary I.J.", "AuthorID": "57215886102", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "The Lothian Birth Cohorts, Division of Psychology, University of Edinburgh"}, "7202128359": {"Name": "Black C.", "AuthorID": "7202128359", "AffiliationID": "60015875", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Health Sciences, University of Aberdeen"}, "7006940003": {"Name": "Porteous D.J.", "AuthorID": "7006940003", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "MRC Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}}}
