Homeostatic and psychogenic stressors activate preproglucagon (PPG) neurons in the caudal nucleus of the solitary tract (cNTS) that produce glucagon-like peptide-1; published work in rodents indicates that these neurons play a crucial role in stress responses. While the axonal targets of PPG neurons are well established, their afferent inputs are unknown. Here we use retrograde tracing with cholera toxin subunit b to show that the cNTS in male and female mice receives axonal inputs similar to those reported in rats. Monosynaptic and polysynaptic inputs specific to cNTS PPG neurons were revealed using Cre-conditional pseudorabies and rabies viruses. The most prominent sources of PPG monosynaptic input include the lateral (LH) and paraventricular (PVN) nuclei of the hypothalamus, parasubthalamic nucleus, lateral division of the central amygdala, and Barrington's nucleus (Bar). Additionally, PPG neurons receive monosynaptic vagal sensory input from the nodose ganglia and spinal sensory input from the dorsal horn. Sources of polysynaptic input to cNTS PPG neurons include the hippocampal formation, paraventricular thalamus, and prefrontal cortex. Finally, cNTS-projecting neurons within PVN, LH, and Bar express the activation marker cFOS in mice after restraint stress, identifying them as potential sources of neurogenic stress-induced recruitment of PPG neurons. In summary, cNTS PPG neurons in mice receive widespread monosynaptic and polysynaptic input from brain regions implicated in coordinating behavioral and physiological stress responses, as well as from vagal and spinal sensory neurons. Thus, PPG neurons are optimally positioned to integrate signals of homeostatic and psychogenic stress.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Recent research has indicated a crucial role for glucagon-like peptide-1-producing preproglucagon (PPG) neurons in regulating both appetite and behavioral and autonomic responses to acute stress. Intriguingly, the central glucagon-like peptide-1 system defined in rodents is conserved in humans, highlighting the translational importance of understanding its anatomical organization. Findings reported here indicate that PPG neurons receive significant monosynaptic and polysynaptic input from brain regions implicated in autonomic and behavioral responses to stress, as well as direct input from vagal and spinal sensory neurons. Improved understanding of the neural pathways underlying the recruitment of PPG neurons may facilitate the development of novel therapies for the treatment of stress-related disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": ["GLP1", "nodose ganglion", "pseudorabies", "rabies", "stress", "viral tracing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Axons", "Female", "Hypothalamus", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Neural Pathways", "Neurons", "Neurons, Afferent", "Posterior Horn Cells", "Proglucagon", "Reflex, Monosynaptic", "Restraint, Physical", "Solitary Nucleus", "Stress, Psychological", "Synapses", "Thalamus", "Vagus Nerve"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075963446", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"56797616700": {"Name": "Holt M.K.", "AuthorID": "56797616700", "AffiliationID": "60002092", "AffiliationName": "Florida State University, Department of Psychology and Program in Neuroscience"}, "6602419860": {"Name": "Pomeranz L.E.", "AuthorID": "6602419860", "AffiliationID": "60026827, 60009470", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Rockefeller University"}, "36672493600": {"Name": "Beier K.T.", "AuthorID": "36672493600", "AffiliationID": "60007278", "AffiliationName": "University of California at Irvine, Department of Physiology and Biophysics"}, "57207008009": {"Name": "Reimann F.", "AuthorID": "57207008009", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60120909", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Metabolic Science, Metabolic Research Laboratories, University of Cambridge"}, "7004733731": {"Name": "Gribble F.M.", "AuthorID": "7004733731", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60120909", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Metabolic Science, Metabolic Research Laboratories, University of Cambridge"}, "7004891774": {"Name": "Rinaman L.", "AuthorID": "7004891774", "AffiliationID": "60002092", "AffiliationName": "Florida State University, Department of Psychology and Program in Neuroscience"}}}
