In this paper we study this type of result in a general context, moving from transition systems to coalgebras and from bisimilarity to coinductive predicates. We formulate when a logic fully characterises a coinductive predicate on coalgebras, by providing suitable notions of adequacy and expressivity, and give sufficient conditions on the semantics. The approach is illustrated with logics characterising similarity, divergence and a behavioural metric on automata.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coalgebra", "Fibration", "Modal logic"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bisimilarity", "Coalgebras", "Fibration", "Modal logic", "Transition system", "Two-state"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077996282", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"6602390943": {"Name": "Kupke C.", "AuthorID": "6602390943", "AffiliationID": "60024724", "AffiliationName": "Strathclyde University"}, "55305790900": {"Name": "Rot J.", "AuthorID": "55305790900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016529", "AffiliationName": "University College London, United Kingdom, Radboud University"}}}
