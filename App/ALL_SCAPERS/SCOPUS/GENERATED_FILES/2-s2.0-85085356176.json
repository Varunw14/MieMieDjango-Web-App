However, the applicability of this technique is affected by data quality issues such as signal drop out in the vicinity of the implanted electrodes. In our center we have limited the technique to a quadrature head transmit and receive RF coil following the results of a safety evaluation. The purpose of this study is to gather further safety-related evidence for performing icEEG-fMRI using a body RF-transmit coil, to allow the greater flexibility afforded by the use of modern, high-density receive arrays, and therefore parallel imaging with benefits such as reduced signal drop-out and distortion artifact. Specifically, we performed a set of empirical temperature measurements on a 1.5T Siemens Avanto MRI scanner with the body RF-transmit coil in a range of electrode and connector cable configurations. The observed RF-induced heating during a high-SAR sequence was maximum in the immediate vicinity of a depth electrode located along the scanner\u2019s central axis (range: 0.2\u20132.4\u00b0C) and below 0.5\u00b0C at the other electrodes. Also for the high-SAR sequence, we observed excessive RF-related heating in connection cable configurations that deviate from our recommended setup. For the low-SAR sequence, the maximum observed temperature increase across all configurations was 0.3\u00b0C. This provides good evidence to allow simultaneous icEEG-fMRI to be performed utilizing the body transmit coil on the 1.5T Siemens Avanto MRI scanner at our center with acceptable additional risk by following a well-defined protocol.", "AuthorKeywords": ["body transmit coil", "EEG", "icEEG-fMRI", "intracranial", "MRI", "RF heating", "safety"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085356176", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"57196297214": {"Name": "Hawsawi H.B.", "AuthorID": "57196297214", "AffiliationID": "124461944", "AffiliationName": "Administartion of Medical Physics, King Abdullah Medical City"}, "7005729118": {"Name": "Lemieux L.", "AuthorID": "7005729118", "AffiliationID": "60030943", "AffiliationName": "MRI Unit, Epilepsy Society"}, "56715472400": {"Name": "Papadaki A.", "AuthorID": "56715472400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "35316314600": {"Name": "Thornton J.S.", "AuthorID": "35316314600", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "8588211000": {"Name": "Carmichael D.W.", "AuthorID": "8588211000", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60177635, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome EPSRC Centre for Medical Engineering, King\u2019s College London, St Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}}}
