This has increased the use of point-of-care paediatric US performed by non-radiologists. With this scoping review, focused on abdominal imaging, we aim to gain an overview of the current practices in the paediatric setting and to assess its impact in daily practice. We present the background and study design of a scoping review for non-radiologist-performed abdominal point-of-care paediatric US using a formal scoping framework. The information shall be derived from published studies. We will submit the review report to a peer-reviewed scientific journal and explore other scientific venues for presenting the work. Based on the completed review, the officers of the European Society of Paediatric Radiology will issue a position statement on non-radiologist-performed point-of-care paediatric US.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adolescents", "Children", "Point-of-care ultrasound", "Scoping review", "Ultrasound"], "IndexKeywords": ["Abdomen", "Child", "Humans", "Pediatrics", "Point-of-Care Systems", "Research Design", "Ultrasonography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071499493", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57201978249": {"Name": "van Wassenaer E.A.", "AuthorID": "57201978249", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60070178", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, Emma Children\u2019s Hospital \u2013 Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam"}, "7003532912": {"Name": "Benninga M.A.", "AuthorID": "7003532912", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60070178", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, Emma Children\u2019s Hospital \u2013 Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam"}, "57210310858": {"Name": "Koot B.G.P.", "AuthorID": "57210310858", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60070178", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, Emma Children\u2019s Hospital \u2013 Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam"}, "55754183800": {"Name": "Daams J.G.", "AuthorID": "55754183800", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "Medical library, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam"}, "55548497100": {"Name": "Rosendahl K.", "AuthorID": "55548497100", "AffiliationID": "60030280", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Section of Pediatric Radiology, Haukeland University Hospital"}, "23467596400": {"Name": "Stafrace S.", "AuthorID": "23467596400", "AffiliationID": "60107609", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Sidra Medical and Research Centre"}, "6507902996": {"Name": "Arthurs O.J.", "AuthorID": "6507902996", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7003453510": {"Name": "van Rijn R.R.", "AuthorID": "7003453510", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60070178", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Emma Children\u2019s Hospital \u2013 Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam"}}}
