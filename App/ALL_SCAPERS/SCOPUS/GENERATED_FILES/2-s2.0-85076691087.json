Brain shift can move the surgical targets and other vital structures such as blood vessels, thus invalidating the pre-surgical plan. Intra-operative ultrasound (iUS) is a convenient and cost-effective imaging tool to track brain shift and tumor resection. Accurate image registration techniques that update pre-surgical MRI based on iUS are crucial but challenging. The MICCAI Challenge 2018 for Correction of Brain shift with Intra-Operative UltraSound (CuRIOUS2018) provided a public platform to benchmark MRI-iUS registration algorithms on newly released clinical datasets. In this work, we present the data, setup, evaluation, and results of CuRIOUS 2018, which received 6 fully automated algorithms from leading academic and industrial research groups. All algorithms were first trained with the public RESECT database, and then ranked based on a test dataset of 10 additional cases with identical data curation and annotation protocols as the RESECT database. The article compares the results of all participating teams and discusses the insights gained from the challenge, as well as future work.", "AuthorKeywords": ["brain", "brain shift", "MRI", "Registration", "tumor", "ultrasound"], "IndexKeywords": ["Annotation protocols", "Brain shifts", "Image registration techniques", "Participating teams", "Quality and safeties", "Registration", "Registration algorithms", "Registration methods"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076691087", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"36731622500": {"Name": "Xiao Y.", "AuthorID": "36731622500", "AffiliationID": "60029991, 60010884", "AffiliationName": "Robarts Research Institute, Western University"}, "23392966100": {"Name": "Maier A.", "AuthorID": "23392966100", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg"}, "13906002800": {"Name": "Wein W.", "AuthorID": "13906002800", "AffiliationID": "60033154", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University"}, "57205258148": {"Name": "Shams R.", "AuthorID": "57205258148", "AffiliationID": "60112016", "AffiliationName": "ImFusion GmbH"}, "16230455400": {"Name": "Kadoury S.", "AuthorID": "16230455400", "AffiliationID": "60009657", "AffiliationName": "CHUM Research Centre"}, "56539423800": {"Name": "Fortin M.", "AuthorID": "56539423800", "AffiliationID": "60033154", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health, Kinesiology and Applied Physiology, Concordia University"}, "57204489643": {"Name": "Drobny D.", "AuthorID": "57204489643", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60109217", "AffiliationName": "King's Health Partners, St Thomas' Hospital"}, "7006617080": {"Name": "MacHado I.", "AuthorID": "7006617080", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60016782", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "22935790400": {"Name": "Ou Y.", "AuthorID": "22935790400", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60030521", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics and Radiology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "13906937800": {"Name": "Rivaz H.", "AuthorID": "13906937800", "AffiliationID": "60012408", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Medical Informatics, University of L\u00fcbeck"}, "52363917500": {"Name": "Heinrich M.P.", "AuthorID": "52363917500", "AffiliationID": "60012408", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Medical Informatics, University of L\u00fcbeck"}, "36628123700": {"Name": "Chabanas M.", "AuthorID": "36628123700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "7003492772": {"Name": "Schnabel J.A.", "AuthorID": "7003492772", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "57026876900": {"Name": "Zhong X.", "AuthorID": "57026876900", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg"}, "24376919100": {"Name": "Modat M.", "AuthorID": "24376919100", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60109217", "AffiliationName": "King's Health Partners, St Thomas' Hospital"}, "14421487600": {"Name": "Reinertsen I.", "AuthorID": "14421487600", "AffiliationID": "60004205", "AffiliationName": "SINTEF"}}}
