This review is designed for a broad audience including radiologists, imaging technologists, rheumatologists and other healthcare professionals. Methods: We discuss the use of qMRI for imaging skeletal inflammation from both technical and clinical perspectives. We consider how qMRI can be targeted to specific aspects of the pathological process in synovium, cartilage, bone, tendons and entheses. Evidence for the various techniques from studies of both adults and children with inflammatory arthritis is reviewed and critically appraised. Results: qMRI has the potential to objectively identify, characterize and quantify inflammation of the connective tissues and skeleton in both adult and pediatric patients. Measurements of tissue properties derived using qMRI methods can serve as imaging biomarkers, which are potentially more reproducible and informative than conventional MRI methods. Several qMRI methods are nearing transition into clinical practice and may inform diagnosis and treatment decisions, with the potential to improve patient outcomes. Conclusions: qMRI enables specific assessment of inflammation in synovium, cartilage, bone, tendons and entheses, and can facilitate a more consistent, personalized approach to diagnosis, characterisation and monitoring of disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Arthritis", "Cartilage", "MRI", "Osteitis", "Quantification", "Synovium"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Arthritis", "Biomarkers", "Cartilage, Articular", "Child", "Evaluation Studies as Topic", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Synovial Membrane"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074671249", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"56736107900": {"Name": "Barendregt A.M.", "AuthorID": "56736107900", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University College London Hospital"}, "7103204541": {"Name": "Maas M.", "AuthorID": "7103204541", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University College London Hospital"}, "57130300100": {"Name": "Bray T.J.P.", "AuthorID": "57130300100", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University College London Hospital"}, "7005861491": {"Name": "Hall-Craggs M.A.", "AuthorID": "7005861491", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University College London Hospital"}}}
