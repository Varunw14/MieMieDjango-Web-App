Methods: Two hundred sixty-seven young people with cancer (n =83 cancer patients receiving active treatment: n =174 cancer survivors, 57.1% >1 year since treatment completion) and 321 controls completed a health and lifestyle questionnaire which included validated measures of physical activity (PA) (Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire), diet (Dietary Instrument for Nutrition Education, DINE), smoking status, and alcohol consumption (AUDIT-C). Results: General population controls and cancer survivors were more likely to meet current (PA) recommendations (p <0.001) than TYA cancer patients undergoing treatment (54.8% vs 52.3% vs 30.1%, respectively). Less than 40% of young people with cancer and controls met fat intake, sugar intake, fibre intake or current fruit and vegetable recommendations. TYA cancer survivors were more likely to report binge drinking than controls (OR=3.26, 95% CI 2.12\u20135.02, p <0.001). Very few young people with in the study were current smokers. The majority of TYA cancer patients and survivors reported a desire to make positive changes to their health behaviour. Conclusion: Consideration should be given to whether existing health behaviour change interventions which have demonstrated positive effects among the general TYA population could be adapted for young people with cancer.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alcohol use", "Diet", "Physical activity", "Survivorship", "Tobacco use"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Alcohol Drinking", "Cancer Survivors", "Diet", "Exercise", "Female", "Fruit", "Health Behavior", "Health Status", "Humans", "Life Style", "Male", "Neoplasms", "Smoking", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United Kingdom", "Vegetables", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071858254", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"57192403645": {"Name": "Pugh G.", "AuthorID": "57192403645", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science & Health, University College London"}, "56660238600": {"Name": "Fisher A.", "AuthorID": "56660238600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science & Health, University College London"}, "9941088900": {"Name": "Hough R.", "AuthorID": "9941088900", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Hospital"}, "57192402155": {"Name": "Gravestock H.", "AuthorID": "57192402155", "AffiliationID": "118900041", "AffiliationName": "CLIC Sargent"}}}
