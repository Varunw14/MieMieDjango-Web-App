However, it suffers from too high an operation temperature and poor reversibility. Here, a synergetic approach is developed to improve the properties. An active porous core\u2013shell network structure is constructed as a scaffold for LiBH4\u2013with carbon nanotube (CNT) as the core and nano\u2013TiO2 decorated porous amorphous carbon as the shell (CNT@PC@TiO2) with an optimized fraction of TiO2. The hybrid scaffold possesses high porosity, large specific surface area and small pore sizes, for effective confinement of LiBH4 by a melt infiltration method and high loadings of LiBH4 up to 50\u201370 wt%, with enhanced interface diffusion and reaction without agglomeration; TiO2 reacts with LiBH4 during the infiltration process, to form LiTiO2 and TiB2 as the catalysts for LiBH4, and the CNTs facilitate heat management. The confined LiBH4 system shows considerable improvement of hydrogen sorption properties. At a LiBH4 loading of 60 wt%, the system releases 7.3 wt% H2 within 60 min at 320 \u00b0C, and a reversible capacity of 5.1 wt% is maintained even after 20 cycles. The present study provides further insight into the rational design and utilization of the synergetic effects of nanoconfinement, catalysis, surface interaction and thermal transfer to improve the overall hydrogen storage performance of LiBH4.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Catalysis", "High capacity", "Hydrogen storage materials", "Lithium borohydride", "Nanoconfinement", "Thermal conductivity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Effective confinements", "Infiltration process", "Large specific surface areas", "Lithium borohydride", "Operation temperature", "Surface interactions", "Theoretical capacity", "Without agglomeration"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092632099", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"57209497418": {"Name": "Xian K.", "AuthorID": "57209497418", "AffiliationID": "60088176, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Silicon Materials, Key Laboratory of Advanced Materials and Applications for Batteries of Zhejiang Province & School of Materials Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University"}, "56514834100": {"Name": "Nie B.", "AuthorID": "56514834100", "AffiliationID": "60088176, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Silicon Materials, Key Laboratory of Advanced Materials and Applications for Batteries of Zhejiang Province & School of Materials Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University"}, "57219423650": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "57219423650", "AffiliationID": "60088176, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Silicon Materials, Key Laboratory of Advanced Materials and Applications for Batteries of Zhejiang Province & School of Materials Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University"}, "57171344600": {"Name": "Gao M.", "AuthorID": "57171344600", "AffiliationID": "60088176, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Silicon Materials, Key Laboratory of Advanced Materials and Applications for Batteries of Zhejiang Province & School of Materials Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University"}, "57192593063": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "57192593063", "AffiliationID": "60088176, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Silicon Materials, Key Laboratory of Advanced Materials and Applications for Batteries of Zhejiang Province & School of Materials Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University"}, "57170293200": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "57170293200", "AffiliationID": "60088176, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Silicon Materials, Key Laboratory of Advanced Materials and Applications for Batteries of Zhejiang Province & School of Materials Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University"}, "57218890588": {"Name": "Pan H.", "AuthorID": "57218890588", "AffiliationID": "60088176, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Silicon Materials, Key Laboratory of Advanced Materials and Applications for Batteries of Zhejiang Province & School of Materials Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University"}, "7005398308": {"Name": "Shang C.", "AuthorID": "7005398308", "AffiliationID": "60114494, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "The University of Hong Kong\u2013Zhejiang Institute of Research and Innovation, Qingshan Lake Scitech City"}, "57198560184": {"Name": "Guo Z.", "AuthorID": "57198560184", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Hong Kong"}}}
