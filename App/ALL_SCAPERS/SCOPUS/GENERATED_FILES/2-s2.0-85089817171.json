All rights reserved.Objectives: To characterize putative AmpC-hyperproducing third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E. coli from dairy farms and their phylogenetic relationships; to identify risk factors for their presence; and to assess evidence for their zoonotic transmission into the local human population. Methods: Proteomics was used to explain differences in antimicrobial susceptibility. WGS allowed phylogenetic analysis. Multilevel, multivariable logistic regression modelling was used to identify risk factors. Results: Increased use of amoxicillin/clavulanate was associated with an increased risk of finding AmpC hyperproducers on farms. Expansion of cephalosporin resistance in AmpC hyperproducers was seen in farm isolates with marR mutations (conferring cefoperazone resistance) or when AmpC was mutated (conferring fourthgeneration cephalosporin and cefoperazone resistance). Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the dominance of ST88 amongst farm AmpC hyperproducers but there was no evidence for acquisition of farm isolates by members of the local human population. Conclusions: Clear evidence was found for recent farm-To-farm transmission of AmpC-hyperproducing E. coli and of adaptive mutations to expand resistance. Whilst there was no evidence of isolates entering the local human population, efforts to reduce third-generation cephalosporin resistance on dairy farms must address the high prevalence of AmpC hyperproducers. The finding that amoxicillin/clavulanate use was associated with an increased risk of finding AmpC hyperproducers is important because this is not currently categorized as a highest-priority critically important antimicrobial and so is not currently targeted for specific usage restrictions in the UK.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089817171", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57218621990": {"Name": "Alzayn M.", "AuthorID": "57218621990", "AffiliationID": "60105146", "AffiliationName": "Biology Department, Faculty of Science, Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University"}, "42461482400": {"Name": "Findlay J.", "AuthorID": "42461482400", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "55890932200": {"Name": "Mounsey O.", "AuthorID": "55890932200", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "57196677795": {"Name": "Gould V.C.", "AuthorID": "57196677795", "AffiliationID": "60115486, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Veterinary School, University of Bristol"}, "7005876020": {"Name": "Avison M.B.", "AuthorID": "7005876020", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "57201709211": {"Name": "Schubert H.", "AuthorID": "57201709211", "AffiliationID": "60115486, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Veterinary School, University of Bristol"}, "57212731853": {"Name": "Turner K.M.", "AuthorID": "57212731853", "AffiliationID": "60115486, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Veterinary School, University of Bristol"}, "7201928493": {"Name": "Barrett D.C.", "AuthorID": "7201928493", "AffiliationID": "60115486, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Veterinary School, University of Bristol"}, "6507641138": {"Name": "Reyher K.K.", "AuthorID": "6507641138", "AffiliationID": "60115486, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Veterinary School, University of Bristol"}, "6602654503": {"Name": "Heesom K.J.", "AuthorID": "6602654503", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University of Bristol Proteomics Facility"}}}
