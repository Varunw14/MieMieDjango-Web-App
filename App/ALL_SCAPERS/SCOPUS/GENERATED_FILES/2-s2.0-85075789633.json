Different psychological comorbidities and functional neurological symptom disorders (FNDs) have been reported; however, these have been poorly explored. Methods: At the International Consultation on Incontinence Research Society meeting in 2019, a panel of clinicians generated a proposal to explore the relationship between psychological comorbidities, FNDs, and urinary retention in women with chronic idiopathic urinary retention. Results: Psychological comorbidities such as depression and anxiety, and FNDs such as leg weakness and loss of consciousness, have been reported in women with idiopathic urinary retention. Individuals react differently to physical and emotional stressors, and experimental models have demonstrated a relationship between the stress response and developing urinary retention. Trauma, particularly sexual trauma, may be a shared risk factor for developing psychological comorbidities and urinary retention. Children with voiding postponement often suffer from psychological comorbidities and behavioral disturbances; however, there is no evidence to suggest that this progresses to urinary retention in adulthood. \u201cPsychogenic urinary retention\u201d has been described in the urology and psychiatry literature in the past, and anecdotal cases of successful voiding following psychotherapy have been reported, though the true pathophysiology of this entity is uncertain. Conclusion: Psychological and functional disorder comorbidities are reported in women with chronic urinary retention. The nature of the association between urinary retention and functional neurological disorder comorbidities needs to be further explored in terms of a disorder of bladder-brain interaction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anxiety", "Fowler's syndrome", "functional neurological symptom disorders", "psychological disorders", "somatization", "urinary retention"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Child", "Female", "Humans", "Mental Disorders", "Nervous System Diseases", "Stress, Psychological", "Urinary Retention", "Urination"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075789633", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"8862148900": {"Name": "Panicker J.N.", "AuthorID": "8862148900", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Uro-Neurology, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery and UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "8412764200": {"Name": "Selai C.", "AuthorID": "8412764200", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences and Department of Uro-Neurology, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery and UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "57191827145": {"Name": "Herve F.", "AuthorID": "57191827145", "AffiliationID": "60012936", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Cliniques Universitaires Saint Luc"}, "55762518600": {"Name": "Rademakers K.", "AuthorID": "55762518600", "AffiliationID": "117943329", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Zuyderland Medical Centre"}, "7004861347": {"Name": "Dmochowski R.", "AuthorID": "7004861347", "AffiliationID": "60030769", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urologic Surgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "6604059935": {"Name": "Tarcan T.", "AuthorID": "6604059935", "AffiliationID": "60004502, 60006369", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Marmara University School of Medicine and Ko\u00e7 University School of Medicine"}, "7007120070": {"Name": "von Gontard A.", "AuthorID": "7007120070", "AffiliationID": "60023686", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Saarland University Hospital"}, "56440005600": {"Name": "Vrijens D.", "AuthorID": "56440005600", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Maastricht University Medical Centre"}}}
