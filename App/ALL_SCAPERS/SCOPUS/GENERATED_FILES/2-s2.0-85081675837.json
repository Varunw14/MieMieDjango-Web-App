The present study, 18F-Fluciclovine PET/CT in biochemicAL reCurrence Of Prostate caNcer (FALCON; NCT02578940), aimed to evaluate the effect of 18F-fluciclovine on management of men with BCR of prostate cancer. Methods and Materials: Men with a first episode of BCR after curative-intent primary therapy were enrolled at 6 UK sites. Patients underwent 18F-fluciclovine positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) according to standardized procedures. Clinicians documented management plans before and after scanning, recording changes to treatment modality as major and changes within a modality as other. The primary outcome measure was record of a revised management plan postscan. Secondary endpoints were evaluation of optimal prostate specific antigen (PSA) threshold for detection, salvage treatment outcome assessment based on 18F-fluciclovine-involvement, and safety. Results: 18F-Fluciclovine was well tolerated in the 104 scanned patients (median PSA = 0.79 ng/mL). Lesions were detected in 58 out of 104 (56%) patients. Detection was broadly proportional to PSA level; \u22641 ng/mL, 1 out of 3 of scans were positive, and 93% scans were positive at PSA >2.0 ng/mL. Sixty-six (64%) patients had a postscan management change (80% after a positive result). Major changes (43 out of 66; 65%) were salvage or systemic therapy to watchful waiting (16 out of 66; 24%); salvage therapy to systemic therapy (16 out of 66; 24%); and alternative changes to treatment modality (11 out of 66, 17%). The remaining 23 out of 66 (35%) management changes were modifications of the prescan plan: most (22 out of 66; 33%) were adjustments to planned brachytherapy/radiation therapy to include a 18F-fluciclovine-guided boost. Where 18F-fluciclovine guided salvage therapy, the PSA response rate was higher than when 18F-fluciclovine was not involved (15 out of 17 [88%] vs 28 out of 39 [72%]). Conclusions: 18F-Fluciclovine PET/CT located recurrence in the majority of men with BCR, frequently resulting in major management plan changes. Incorporating 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT into treatment planning may optimize targeting of recurrence sites and avoid futile salvage therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Localization of lesions", "Methods and materials", "Positron emission tomography/computed tomographies", "Prostate specific antigen", "Salvage treatment", "Standardized procedure", "Treatment modality", "Treatment planning"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081675837", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"8613885700": {"Name": "Scarsbrook A.F.", "AuthorID": "8613885700", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "University of Leeds"}, "7006099164": {"Name": "Bottomley D.", "AuthorID": "7006099164", "AffiliationID": "60012508", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "56191203300": {"Name": "Teoh E.J.", "AuthorID": "56191203300", "AffiliationID": "118997745", "AffiliationName": "Blue Earth Diagnostics"}, "57193075846": {"Name": "Chau A.", "AuthorID": "57193075846", "AffiliationID": "118997745", "AffiliationName": "Blue Earth Diagnostics"}, "57220790617": {"Name": "Miller M.P.", "AuthorID": "57220790617", "AffiliationID": "118997745", "AffiliationName": "Blue Earth Diagnostics"}, "24474210900": {"Name": "Bradley K.M.", "AuthorID": "24474210900", "AffiliationID": "60103683", "AffiliationName": "PETIC, Wales Research and Diagnostic PET Imaging Centre"}, "7005709693": {"Name": "Payne H.", "AuthorID": "7005709693", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "38662206500": {"Name": "Afaq A.", "AuthorID": "38662206500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005791371": {"Name": "Bomanji J.", "AuthorID": "7005791371", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "23475918100": {"Name": "van As N.", "AuthorID": "23475918100", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "34979909200": {"Name": "Chua S.", "AuthorID": "34979909200", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "23137597600": {"Name": "Hoskin P.", "AuthorID": "23137597600", "AffiliationID": "60006776", "AffiliationName": "Mount Vernon Cancer Centre"}, "57216065913": {"Name": "Chambers A.", "AuthorID": "57216065913", "AffiliationID": "60006776", "AffiliationName": "Mount Vernon Cancer Centre"}, "8880415200": {"Name": "Cook G.J.", "AuthorID": "8880415200", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60172291, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "King's College London and Guy's & St Thomas\u2019 PET Centre, St Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "22936078500": {"Name": "Warbey V.S.", "AuthorID": "22936078500", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60172291, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "King's College London and Guy's & St Thomas\u2019 PET Centre, St Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "57216379444": {"Name": "Han S.", "AuthorID": "57216379444", "AffiliationID": "60007687, 60032803", "AffiliationName": "West of Scotland PET Centre, Gartnavel General Hospital"}, "57202594582": {"Name": "Leung H.Y.", "AuthorID": "57202594582", "AffiliationID": "60031990", "AffiliationName": "CRUK Beatson Institute"}, "34974131200": {"Name": "Gleeson F.V.", "AuthorID": "34974131200", "AffiliationID": "60170323", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57220530449": {"Name": "Andrade G.", "AuthorID": "57220530449", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57215695058": {"Name": "Camilieri P.", "AuthorID": "57215695058", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57215004857": {"Name": "Hyde K.", "AuthorID": "57215004857", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "35211384400": {"Name": "Macpherson R.", "AuthorID": "35211384400", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "35217989500": {"Name": "Patel N.", "AuthorID": "35217989500", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57220443337": {"Name": "Sabharwal A.", "AuthorID": "57220443337", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "36140441700": {"Name": "Subesinghe M.", "AuthorID": "36140441700", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57195545788": {"Name": "Tsakok M.", "AuthorID": "57195545788", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
