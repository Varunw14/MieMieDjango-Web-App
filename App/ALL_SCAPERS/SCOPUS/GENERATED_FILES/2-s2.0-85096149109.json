We aimed to identify causative mutations in 10 probands. Neurological examinations, genetic analysis, audiometry, magnetic resonance imaging, biochemical and immunological testings, and/or muscle histopathology were performed. Mutations in known causative gene SLC52A3 were found in 7 probands. More importantly, only 1 mutated allele was observed in several patients, and variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance were clearly noted. Environmental insults may contribute to variable presentations. Putative causative mutations in other genes were identified in 3 probands. Two of the genes, WDFY4 and TNFSF13B, have immune-related functions. Inflammatory responses were implicated in the patient with the WDFY4 mutation. Malfunction of the immune system and mitochondrial anomalies were shown in the patient with the TNFSF13B mutation. Prevalence of heterozygous SLC52A3 BVVL causative mutations and notable variability in expressivity of homozygous and heterozygous genotypes are being reported for the first time. Identification of WDFY4 and TNFSF13B as candidate causative genes supports conjectures on involvement of the immune system in BVVL and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere (BVVL) syndrome", "Fazio-Londe (FL) syndrome", "SLC52A3", "TNFSF13B", "WDFY4"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096149109", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"56394232500": {"Name": "Khani M.", "AuthorID": "56394232500", "AffiliationID": "60022927", "AffiliationName": "School of Biology, College of Science, University of Tehran"}, "57208922885": {"Name": "Taheri H.", "AuthorID": "57208922885", "AffiliationID": "60022927", "AffiliationName": "School of Biology, College of Science, University of Tehran"}, "54968723700": {"Name": "Moazzeni H.", "AuthorID": "54968723700", "AffiliationID": "60022927", "AffiliationName": "School of Biology, College of Science, University of Tehran"}, "57219925774": {"Name": "Heshmati A.", "AuthorID": "57219925774", "AffiliationID": "60022927", "AffiliationName": "School of Biology, College of Science, University of Tehran"}, "57219927972": {"Name": "Taghizadeh P.", "AuthorID": "57219927972", "AffiliationID": "60022927", "AffiliationName": "School of Biology, College of Science, University of Tehran"}, "55883335700": {"Name": "Elahi E.", "AuthorID": "55883335700", "AffiliationID": "60022927", "AffiliationName": "School of Biology, College of Science, University of Tehran"}, "26430039700": {"Name": "Shamshiri H.", "AuthorID": "26430039700", "AffiliationID": "60002680, 60027708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Shariati Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"}, "57191571771": {"Name": "Okhovat A.A.", "AuthorID": "57191571771", "AffiliationID": "60002680, 60027708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Shariati Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"}, "55388067900": {"Name": "Abdi S.", "AuthorID": "55388067900", "AffiliationID": "60002680, 60027708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Shariati Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"}, "16679369800": {"Name": "Nafissi S.", "AuthorID": "16679369800", "AffiliationID": "60123811, 60027708", "AffiliationName": "Iranian Center of Neurological Research, Neuroscience Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"}, "57207702422": {"Name": "Hardy J.", "AuthorID": "57207702422", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57200436456": {"Name": "Bras J.T.", "AuthorID": "57200436456", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "56396402800": {"Name": "Carmona S.", "AuthorID": "56396402800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "19639734300": {"Name": "Alavi A.", "AuthorID": "19639734300", "AffiliationID": "60072432", "AffiliationName": "Genetics Research Center, University of Social Welfare and Rehabilitation Sciences"}, "57211450454": {"Name": "Nilipour Y.", "AuthorID": "57211450454", "AffiliationID": "60111633, 60018934", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Pathology Research Center, Research Institute for Children Health, Mofid and Shohaday-e Tajrish Hospital, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"}, "57219931434": {"Name": "Ghazanfari T.", "AuthorID": "57219931434", "AffiliationID": "125374640", "AffiliationName": "Simorg Pathobiology Laboratory"}, "55364062100": {"Name": "Shahabi M.", "AuthorID": "55364062100", "AffiliationID": "60106089", "AffiliationName": "Blood Transfusion Research Center, High Institute for Research and Education in Transfusion Medicine"}, "57192927195": {"Name": "Rohani M.", "AuthorID": "57192927195", "AffiliationID": "60159736, 60024852", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Hazrat Rasool Hospital, Iran University of Medical Sciences"}, "57219925077": {"Name": "Valle G.", "AuthorID": "57219925077", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology and CRIBI Biotechnology Centre, University of Padova"}, "57192174369": {"Name": "Boostani R.", "AuthorID": "57192174369", "AffiliationID": "60001500", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Department of Neurology, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences"}, "55336869800": {"Name": "Eshghi S.", "AuthorID": "55336869800", "AffiliationID": "60001500", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Department of Neurology, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences"}}}
