Identification of high-risk cases will enable appropriate intervention and escalation. This study investigates the routine laboratory tests and cytokines implicated in COVID-19 for their potential application as biomarkers of disease severity, respiratory failure and need of higher-level care. From analysis of 203 samples, CRP, IL-6, IL-10 and LDH were most strongly correlated with the WHO ordinal scale of illness severity, the fraction of inspired oxygen delivery, radiological evidence of ARDS and level of respiratory support (p \u2264 0.001). IL-6 levels of \u22653.27 pg/ml provide a sensitivity of 0.87 and specificity of 0.64 for a requirement of ventilation, and a CRP of \u226537 mg/l of 0.91 and 0.66. Reliable stratification of high-risk cases has significant implications on patient triage, resource management and potentially the initiation of novel therapies in severe patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomarkers", "COVID-19", "CRP", "Cytokines", "IL-10", "IL-6", "Intensive care", "LDH"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Biomarkers", "C-Reactive Protein", "COVID-19", "Cytokine Release Syndrome", "Female", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Interleukin-10", "Interleukin-6", "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Respiration, Artificial", "Respiratory Distress Syndrome", "Risk Factors", "SARS-CoV-2", "Severity of Illness Index"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094967689", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"57201481051": {"Name": "Keddie S.", "AuthorID": "57201481051", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60020736", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimmunology and CSF laboratory, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "55263618500": {"Name": "Ziff O.", "AuthorID": "55263618500", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60020736", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimmunology and CSF laboratory, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57219727740": {"Name": "Chou M.K.L.", "AuthorID": "57219727740", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60020736", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimmunology and CSF laboratory, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57220757687": {"Name": "Taylor R.L.", "AuthorID": "57220757687", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60020736", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimmunology and CSF laboratory, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57219729373": {"Name": "Garr E.", "AuthorID": "57219729373", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60020736", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimmunology and CSF laboratory, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "36514953100": {"Name": "Lakdawala N.", "AuthorID": "36514953100", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60020736", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimmunology and CSF laboratory, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57219721647": {"Name": "Church A.", "AuthorID": "57219721647", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60020736", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimmunology and CSF laboratory, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "8571764500": {"Name": "Chapman M.D.", "AuthorID": "8571764500", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60020736", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimmunology and CSF laboratory, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57219722577": {"Name": "Hart M.", "AuthorID": "57219722577", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60020736", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimmunology and CSF laboratory, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7004224851": {"Name": "Lunn M.P.", "AuthorID": "7004224851", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60020736", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimmunology and CSF laboratory, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "36463576300": {"Name": "Heslegrave A.", "AuthorID": "36463576300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute, University College London"}, "57210752435": {"Name": "Ludwig D.", "AuthorID": "57210752435", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "8238987600": {"Name": "Manson J.", "AuthorID": "8238987600", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "8709944400": {"Name": "Scully M.", "AuthorID": "8709944400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Cardiometabolic Programme-NIHR UCLH/UC BRC"}, "57219723948": {"Name": "Nastouli E.", "AuthorID": "57219723948", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Infection control department, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"}}}
