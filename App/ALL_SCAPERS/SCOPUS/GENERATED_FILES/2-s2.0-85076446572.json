METHODS: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) only of at least 6 months' duration evaluating Miller's Class I or II GR (\u22653 mm) treated by means of RC procedures. Five databases were searched up to January 16, 2018. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted thoroughly. RESULTS: We included 48 RCTs in the SR. The results indicated a greater GR reduction for subepithelial connective tissue grafts (SCTG) + coronally advanced flap (CAF) compared to guided tissue regeneration with resorbable membranes (GTR rm) + CAF (mean difference [MD]: -0.37 mm). There was insufficient evidence of a difference in GR reduction between acellular dermal matrix grafts (ADMG) + CAF and SCTG + CAF or between enamel matrix derivative (EMD) + CAF and SCTG + CAF. Greater gains in the keratinized tissue width (KTW) were found for SCTG + CAF when compared to EMD + CAF (MD: -1.06 mm), and SCTG + CAF when compared to GTR rm + CAF (MD: -1.77 mm). There was insufficient evidence of a difference in KTW gain between ADMG + CAF and SCTG + CAF. CONCLUSIONS: SCTG, CAF alone or associated with another biomaterial may be used for treating single or multiple GR. There is also some evidence suggesting that ADMG appear as the soft tissue substitute that may provide the most similar outcomes to those achieved by SCTG.", "AuthorKeywords": ["gingival recession", "surgery", "surgical flaps", "therapy", "tooth root"], "IndexKeywords": ["Connective Tissue", "Gingiva", "Gingival Recession", "Guided Tissue Regeneration, Periodontal", "Humans", "Surgical Flaps", "Tooth Root", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076446572", "SubjectAreas": [["Periodontics", "DENT", "3506"]], "AuthorData": {"24343158300": {"Name": "Chambrone L.", "AuthorID": "24343158300", "AffiliationID": "60070348", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Basic Oral Investigation (UIBO), School of Dentistry, Universidad El Bosque"}, "57212324755": {"Name": "Ortega M.A.S.", "AuthorID": "57212324755", "AffiliationID": "60010831", "AffiliationName": "MSc Dentistry Program, Ibirapuera University"}, "24345502300": {"Name": "Sukekava F.", "AuthorID": "24345502300", "AffiliationID": "106383911", "AffiliationName": "Private practice"}, "7003711963": {"Name": "Rotundo R.", "AuthorID": "7003711963", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Periodontology, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "15842800000": {"Name": "Buti J.", "AuthorID": "15842800000", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Periodontology, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "56603166000": {"Name": "Kalemaj Z.", "AuthorID": "56603166000", "AffiliationID": "100607541", "AffiliationName": "Private practice"}, "57212323943": {"Name": "Prato G.P.P.", "AuthorID": "57212323943", "AffiliationID": "109717563", "AffiliationName": "Tuscany Academy of Dental Research (ATRO)"}}}
