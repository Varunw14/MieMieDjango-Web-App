All rights reserved.Purpose: Speechreading (lipreading) is a correlate of reading ability in both deaf and hearing children. We investigated whether the relationship between speechreading and single-word reading is mediated by phonological awareness in deaf and hearing children. Method: In two separate studies, 66 deaf children and 138 hearing children, aged 5\u20138 years old, were assessed on measures of speechreading, phonological awareness, and single-word reading. We assessed the concurrent relationships between latent variables measuring speechreading, phonological awareness, and single-word reading. Results: In both deaf and hearing children, there was a strong relationship between speechreading and single-word reading, which was fully mediated by phonological awareness. Conclusions: These results are consistent with ideas from previous studies that visual speech information contributes to the development of phonological representations in both deaf and hearing children, which, in turn, support learning to read. Future longitudinal and training studies are required to establish whether these relationships reflect causal effects.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096202726", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"57216425479": {"Name": "Buchanan-Worster E.", "AuthorID": "57216425479", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Deafness Cognition and Language Research Centre, University College London"}, "6602263850": {"Name": "Macsweeney M.", "AuthorID": "6602263850", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Deafness Cognition and Language Research Centre, University College London"}, "26650178200": {"Name": "Pimperton H.", "AuthorID": "26650178200", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "6603065051": {"Name": "Kyle F.", "AuthorID": "6603065051", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Deafness Cognition and Language Research Centre, University College London"}, "57210741369": {"Name": "Beedie I.", "AuthorID": "57210741369", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Deafness Cognition and Language Research Centre, University College London"}, "57193444123": {"Name": "Ralph-Lewis A.", "AuthorID": "57193444123", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Deafness Cognition and Language Research Centre, University College London"}, "35375860800": {"Name": "Harris M.", "AuthorID": "35375860800", "AffiliationID": "60014564", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Oxford Brookes University"}, "57203044840": {"Name": "Hulme C.", "AuthorID": "57203044840", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, University of Oxford"}}}
