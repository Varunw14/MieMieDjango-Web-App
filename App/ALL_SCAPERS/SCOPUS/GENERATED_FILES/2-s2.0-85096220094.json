However, interpreting geophysical data (such as velocities and dynamic modulus and fracture density/alignment) generated from geothermal reservoirs remains difficult. Here we present the results of a new laboratory study measuring seismic attributes of fresh and hydrothermally altered rocks from a Philippine geothermal field (Southern Negros Geothermal Project - SNGP) during triaxial deformation. Two types of rocks were obtained by sub-coring samples of low porosity (~1%) andesite and higher porosity (~10%) volcaniclastic samples from the SNGP. Samples were prepared with two offset drill holes to allow a natural fracture to permit fluid flow along the fracture. An embedded array of Acoustic Emission (AE) sensors allows elastic wave and induced microseismic data to be collected. We measure a significant reduction in elastic wave velocities and moduli, with the exception of Poisson's ratio, after shear fracture development. An initially pre-fractured permeability of approximately 10\u221217 m2 is measured. We find that the permeability decreases from 2.0 \u00d7 10\u221214 m2 to lower than 7.4 \u00d7 10\u221215 m2 as the confining pressure is increased from 5 MPa to 30 MPa. A concomitant increase in P and S-wave velocities, dynamic bulk and Young's moduli are also measured. Finally, we simulate a geothermal \u2018venting\u2019 situation by intentionally releasing the high pore fluid (water) pressure from 10 to 50 MPa to ambient pressure, generating a swarm of AE that increases in duration with higher pore pressure. We postulate that this is due to fluid phase change (liquid to gas) and movement along the natural fracture plane and damage zone.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acoustic emission", "Geothermal", "Seismic attributes", "Triaxial vessel"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic emission sensors", "Elastic wave velocity", "Fractured permeability", "Geothermal resources", "Hydrothermally altered rocks", "P- and S-wave velocities", "Philippine geothermal fields", "Triaxial deformation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096220094", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"57213156294": {"Name": "Austria D.C.", "AuthorID": "57213156294", "AffiliationID": "60025475", "AffiliationName": "Rock Mechanics Laboratory, School of Earth and Environmental sciences, University of Portsmouth"}, "8980992700": {"Name": "Benson P.M.", "AuthorID": "8980992700", "AffiliationID": "60025475", "AffiliationName": "Rock Mechanics Laboratory, School of Earth and Environmental sciences, University of Portsmouth"}}}
