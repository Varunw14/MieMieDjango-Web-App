However, this improvement came at the cost of current loss. In this work, we continue to investigate the cause of the current loss and propose a method to recover it without compromising the voltage. Photoluminescence measurements have confirmed that optimizing the thickness of the GaAs layers in the i-region can lead to strong current gain (\u223c14%) with minimal voltage loss (<3%) and alteration of the QD quality. The capacitance-voltage measurement results support that the current gain mainly originates from the increased depletion width.", "AuthorKeywords": ["current recovery", "MBE", "QDSC"], "IndexKeywords": ["Capacitance voltage measurements", "Current gains", "Depletion widths", "Doped quantum dots", "Photoluminescence measurements", "QDSC", "Quantum dot solar cells", "Strong currents"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074104487", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"]], "AuthorData": {"57205403921": {"Name": "Chan S.", "AuthorID": "57205403921", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57211084372": {"Name": "Kim D.", "AuthorID": "57211084372", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55365959800": {"Name": "Tang M.", "AuthorID": "55365959800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57200966225": {"Name": "Li X.", "AuthorID": "57200966225", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "15765485000": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "15765485000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
