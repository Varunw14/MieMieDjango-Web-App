We aimed to explore service provider and user experiences and perspectives on behavioural interventions to reduce sexual behaviour risks, and the use of automated methods to triage individuals to these services. Methods We conducted a sequential mixed methods study with sexual health service providers and users in 2015/2016. Qualitative interviews with providers and service users (heterosexual young people and MSM) in London and Brighton allowed us to explore a range of experiences and expectations. A subsequent national web-survey of service providers measured the feasibility of delivery within existing resources and preferences for intervention attributes. Results We conducted 35 service user (15 heterosexual young people; 20 MSM) and 26 provider interviews and had 100 web-survey responses. We found considerable heterogeneity in prevention services offered. Service users and providers were broadly supportive of tailoring interventions offered, but service users raised concerns about automated, data-driven triage, particularly around equity and fairness of service delivery. Digital technologies, including social media or apps, were appealing to providers, being less resource intensive. However, one-to-one talking interventions remained popular with both service users and providers, being familiar, trustworthy and personal. Key tensions between desirability of interventions and availability of resources to deliver them were acknowledged/recognised by providers and users. Conclusion Overall, behavioural interventions to reduce sexual behaviour risks were viewed favourably by service providers and users, with key considerations including: Privacy, personalisation and convenience. However, introducing desirable targeted interventions within heterogeneous sexual health settings will require resources to adapt interventions and research to fully understand the barriers and facilitators to use within routine services.", "AuthorKeywords": ["intervention", "MSM", "risk reduction", "STI", "young people"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "England", "Female", "Health Personnel", "Homosexuality, Male", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Qualitative Research", "Risk Reduction Behavior", "Sexual Behavior", "Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078323323", "SubjectAreas": [["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57201499826": {"Name": "Roy A.", "AuthorID": "57201499826", "AffiliationID": "60100018", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Public Health, Brighton and Sussex Medical School"}, "36708602800": {"Name": "Pollard A.", "AuthorID": "36708602800", "AffiliationID": "60100018", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Public Health, Brighton and Sussex Medical School"}, "8419298800": {"Name": "Llewellyn C.", "AuthorID": "8419298800", "AffiliationID": "60100018", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Public Health, Brighton and Sussex Medical School"}, "56238681300": {"Name": "King C.", "AuthorID": "56238681300", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health Sciences, Karolinska Institutet"}, "57209757944": {"Name": "Gilson R.", "AuthorID": "57209757944", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "7006284234": {"Name": "Burns F.", "AuthorID": "7006284234", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "35944368900": {"Name": "Rodger A.", "AuthorID": "35944368900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "7006172333": {"Name": "Shahmanesh M.", "AuthorID": "7006172333", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "9271698500": {"Name": "Richardson D.", "AuthorID": "9271698500", "AffiliationID": "60100018", "AffiliationName": "Sexual Health and HIV Medicine, Brighton and Sussex Medical School"}, "57214307549": {"Name": "Clark L.", "AuthorID": "57214307549", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Sexual Health and HIV, Brighton and Sussex University NHS Trust"}, "57203479433": {"Name": "Miners A.", "AuthorID": "57203479433", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Health Services Research and Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "26427608100": {"Name": "Desai S.", "AuthorID": "26427608100", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Blood Safety, Hepatitis, Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI), HIV Service, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "7404350273": {"Name": "Bailey J.", "AuthorID": "7404350273", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}}}
