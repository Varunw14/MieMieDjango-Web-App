This topic has often provoked reaction, perhaps because some have seen it as a challenge to critical state frameworks of soil behaviour. A particular issue is whether incomplete testing or other test defects might cause such an apparent behaviour. Confusion around the topic has not been helped by the wide range of degrees of convergence seen for different materials and differences seen between convergence in compression and shearing. This paper proposes a unifying means of plotting laboratory test data from such soils that will hopefully provide a rational framework for such discussions, since it makes explicit the degree of convergence towards unique volumetric states for different forms of loading. Data are examined for three \u201ctransitional\u201d soils. The results show that bringing about convergence for these soils would require strains beyond those that may easily be applied and that the lack of convergence cannot solely be an artefact of test defects. Plastic volumetric strain was found to cause much faster convergence than plastic shear strain.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Compression line", "Critical state", "Critical state lines", "Degree of convergence", "Faster convergence", "Laboratory test", "Plastic shear strain", "Plastic volumetric strain"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077689806", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology", "EART", "1909"]], "AuthorData": {"55861995000": {"Name": "Todisco M.C.", "AuthorID": "55861995000", "AffiliationID": "123748492", "AffiliationName": "Coffey U.K."}, "12243933700": {"Name": "Coop M.R.", "AuthorID": "12243933700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
