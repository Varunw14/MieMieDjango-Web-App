We examined the potential of plasma markers Abeta(1-42/1-40), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light (NfL) to identify cerebral amyloidosis and/or disease severity. Methods: We included individuals with a positive (n = 176: 63 \u00b1 7 years, 87 (49%) females) or negative (n = 76: 61 \u00b1 9 years, 27 (36%) females) amyloid PET status, with syndrome diagnosis subjective cognitive decline (18 PET+, 25 PET-), mild cognitive impairment (26 PET+, 24 PET-), or AD-dementia (132 PET+). Plasma Abeta(1-42/1-40), GFAP, and NfL were measured by Simoa. We applied two-way ANOVA adjusted for age and sex to investigate the associations of the plasma markers with amyloid PET status and syndrome diagnosis; logistic regression analysis with Wald's backward selection to identify an optimal panel that identifies amyloid PET positivity; age, sex, and education-adjusted linear regression analysis to investigate associations between the plasma markers and neuropsychological test performance; and Spearman's correlation analysis to investigate associations between the plasma markers and medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA). Results: Abeta(1-42/1-40) and GFAP independently associated with amyloid PET status (p = 0.009 and p < 0.001 respectively), and GFAP and NfL independently associated with syndrome diagnosis (p = 0.001 and p = 0.048 respectively). The optimal panel identifying a positive amyloid status included Abeta(1-42/1-40) and GFAP, alongside age and APOE (AUC = 88% (95% CI 83-93%), 82% sensitivity, 86% specificity), while excluding NfL and sex. GFAP and NfL robustly associated with cognitive performance on global cognition and all major cognitive domains (GFAP: range standardized \u03b2 (s\u03b2) = - 0.40 to - 0.26; NfL: range s\u03b2 = - 0.35 to - 0.18; all: p < 0.002), whereas Abeta(1-42/1-40) associated with global cognition, memory, attention, and executive functioning (range s\u03b2 = 0.22 - 0.11; all: p < 0.05) but not language. GFAP and NfL showed moderate positive correlations with MTA (both: Spearman's rho> 0.33, p < 0.001). Abeta(1-42/1-40) showed a moderate negative correlation with MTA (Spearman's rho = - 0.24, p = 0.001). Discussion and conclusions: Combination of plasma Abeta(1-42/1-40) and GFAP provides a valuable tool for the identification of amyloid PET status. Furthermore, plasma GFAP and NfL associate with various disease severity measures suggesting potential for disease monitoring.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's continuum", "Amyloid pathology", "Blood-based biomarkers", "Plasma amyloid beta", "Plasma GFAP"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092033981", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"57204106300": {"Name": "Verberk I.M.W.", "AuthorID": "57204106300", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60013779", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Center Amsterdam, Department of Neurology, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC"}, "57215650370": {"Name": "Thijssen E.", "AuthorID": "57215650370", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Neurochemistry Laboratory, Department of Clinical Chemistry, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC"}, "57219280381": {"Name": "Koelewijn J.", "AuthorID": "57219280381", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Neurochemistry Laboratory, Department of Clinical Chemistry, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC"}, "57210241893": {"Name": "Teunissen C.E.", "AuthorID": "57210241893", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Neurochemistry Laboratory, Department of Clinical Chemistry, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC"}, "57202630249": {"Name": "De Wilde A.", "AuthorID": "57202630249", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60013779", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Center Amsterdam, Department of Neurology, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC"}, "55274168400": {"Name": "Zwan M.D.", "AuthorID": "55274168400", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60013779", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Center Amsterdam, Department of Neurology, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC"}, "40462134000": {"Name": "Ossenkoppele R.", "AuthorID": "40462134000", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Memory Research Unit, Lund University"}, "57204745168": {"Name": "Scheltens P.", "AuthorID": "57204745168", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60013779", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Center Amsterdam, Department of Neurology, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC"}, "57204743974": {"Name": "Van Der Flier W.M.", "AuthorID": "57204743974", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Data Science, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC"}, "57190583404": {"Name": "Mauroo K.", "AuthorID": "57190583404", "AffiliationID": "60112912", "AffiliationName": "ADx NeuroSciences"}, "57195095579": {"Name": "Vanbrabant J.", "AuthorID": "57195095579", "AffiliationID": "60112912", "AffiliationName": "ADx NeuroSciences"}, "21036335500": {"Name": "Stoops E.", "AuthorID": "21036335500", "AffiliationID": "60112912", "AffiliationName": "ADx NeuroSciences"}, "7003790485": {"Name": "Vanderstichele H.M.", "AuthorID": "7003790485", "AffiliationID": "112928041", "AffiliationName": "Biomarkable"}, "55237599500": {"Name": "Verfaillie S.C.J.", "AuthorID": "55237599500", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC"}, "57204594265": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "57204594265", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Institutes of Neurology and Healthcare Engineering"}, "57208893449": {"Name": "Van Berckel B.N.M.", "AuthorID": "57208893449", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC"}}}
