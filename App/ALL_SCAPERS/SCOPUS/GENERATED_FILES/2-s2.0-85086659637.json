In addition to continued international support for scaling low carbon solutions and facilitating replicability in developing countries, there remains an important need to increase the amount of climate finance provided to innovation, particularly demonstration (for technology innovation) and pilot implementation (for policy innovation), and to channel a greater proportion of Official Development Assistance (ODA) to \u2018hard-to-abate\u2019 areas, such as industrial decarbonisation, international transport and cross-sectoral issues like cooling and behavioural insights, to accelerate the commercialisation and implementation of technological, financial and policy solutions to contribute to meeting the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to \u2018well-below\u2019 2 \u00b0C in these countries. Linking research, development and demonstration (RD&D) support with technical assistance is important in providing the route to obtain wider donor finance (concessional finance) and private finance to enable deployment through scalability and replicability.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Behavioural insights", "Climate finance", "Climate policy", "Industrial decarbonisation", "International transport", "Official development assistance", "Paris Agreement", "Sustainable cooling"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086659637", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"55883342800": {"Name": "Warren P.", "AuthorID": "55883342800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Policy, University College London (UCL)"}}}
