Despite its industrial relevance, the kinetic origin of the high catalytic activity remains under debate. The present report discusses a reaction mechanism of HER on Ni-Mo catalysts by combining experimental and theoretical studies. In contrast to a Ni catalyst, a Ni-Mo catalyst is insensitive to CO gas introduced during HER. In situ spectroscopic measurements including Raman spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) show that Mo3+ prevails during HER catalysis. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations corroborate the thermodynamic stability and HER activity of Mo3+-containing centers on Ni(111) at HER potentials. Notably, Ni is demonstrated to play no direct role as a catalytic site but to effectively disperse and activate the oxidized catalytic Mo species. The results illustrate how to improve the electrocatalytic activity for alkaline HER.", "AuthorKeywords": ["alkaline", "EPR", "hydrogen evolution", "molybdenum", "nickel"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alkaline conditions", "Composite functions", "Electrocatalytic activity", "Electron paramagnetic resonances (EPR)", "Hydrogen evolution", "Reaction mechanism", "Spectroscopic measurements", "Theoretical study"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096078250", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"36058344600": {"Name": "Bau J.A.", "AuthorID": "36058344600", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), KAUST Catalysis Center (KCC)"}, "56924669500": {"Name": "Kozlov S.M.", "AuthorID": "56924669500", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, National University of Singapore"}, "55142490200": {"Name": "Azofra L.M.", "AuthorID": "55142490200", "AffiliationID": "60009669", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Estudios Ambientales y Recursos Naturales (I-UNAT), Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (ULPGC), Campus de Tafira"}, "24344810300": {"Name": "Ould-Chikh S.", "AuthorID": "24344810300", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), KAUST Catalysis Center (KCC)"}, "56465514800": {"Name": "Cavallo L.", "AuthorID": "56465514800", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), KAUST Catalysis Center (KCC)"}, "6603116233": {"Name": "Takanabe K.", "AuthorID": "6603116233", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical System Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Tokyo"}, "6507012683": {"Name": "Emwas A.H.", "AuthorID": "6507012683", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), KAUST Imaging and Characterization Core Lab"}, "7006768868": {"Name": "Idriss H.", "AuthorID": "7006768868", "AffiliationID": "125370489", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Research and Development, Saudi Arabian Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC)"}}}
