We hypothesised that genetic variants related to alcohol consumption may, via their effect on alcohol behaviour, influence mate selection. Here, we find strong evidence that an individual\u2019s self-reported alcohol consumption and their genotype at rs1229984, a missense variant in ADH1B, are associated with their partner\u2019s self-reported alcohol use. Applying Mendelian randomization, we estimate that a unit increase in an individual\u2019s weekly alcohol consumption increases partner\u2019s alcohol consumption by 0.26 units (95% C.I. 0.15, 0.38; P = 8.20 \u00d7 10\u22126). Furthermore, we find evidence of spousal genotypic concordance for rs1229984, suggesting that spousal concordance for alcohol consumption existed prior to cohabitation. Although the SNP is strongly associated with ancestry, our results suggest some concordance independent of population stratification. Our findings suggest that alcohol behaviour directly influences mate selection.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Alcohol Dehydrogenase", "Alcohol Drinking", "Alcoholism", "Biological Specimen Banks", "Female", "Genotype", "Humans", "Male", "Marriage", "Phenotype", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Reproduction", "Self Report", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075190752", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57194582090": {"Name": "Howe L.J.", "AuthorID": "57194582090", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "56384512100": {"Name": "Lawson D.J.", "AuthorID": "56384512100", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60172455", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Integrative Epidemiology Unit, Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "41561133300": {"Name": "Davies N.M.", "AuthorID": "41561133300", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60172455", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Integrative Epidemiology Unit, Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "57208011232": {"Name": "St. Pourcain B.", "AuthorID": "57208011232", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University"}, "57198811524": {"Name": "Lewis S.J.", "AuthorID": "57198811524", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60172455", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Integrative Epidemiology Unit, Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "57220145221": {"Name": "Davey Smith G.", "AuthorID": "57220145221", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60172455", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Integrative Epidemiology Unit, Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "57207869708": {"Name": "Hemani G.", "AuthorID": "57207869708", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60172455", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Integrative Epidemiology Unit, Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol"}}}
