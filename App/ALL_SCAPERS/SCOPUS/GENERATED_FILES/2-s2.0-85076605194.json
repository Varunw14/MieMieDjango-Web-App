These aquifers are drained by springs which, in the Mediterranean region, act as refugia for preserving biodiversity of species that need continuous water. Some springs are also used for drinking water for wild animals, livestock and humans, so if their water quality is compromised it can become a threat to public health. However, the impact of nitrate pollution on these biotic communities remains unknown. We sampled 338 assemblages of aquatic and semi-aquatic bryophytes (i.e., hygrophytic mosses and liverworts) growing in springs in a gradient of water conductivity, nitrate concentration and climate and distributed across the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula to investigate the impact of nitrate pollution on the diversity of bryophytes and moss functional traits in Mediterranean springs. Based on previous literature suggesting that increased nitrogen load decreases biodiversity in grasslands and freshwater ecosystems, we hypothesised that water nitrate pollution in springs decreases bryophyte diversity at the local and regional scales. Our results indicated that, at the local scale (spring), nitrate pollution reduced the number and the likelihood of finding a rare species in springs. Rare species were found in 4% of the springs with nitrate above 50 mg L\u22121 but in 32% of the springs with nitrate below 50 mg L\u22121. Moss, liverwort and overall bryophyte diversity were not directly affected by nitrate at the local scale but nitrate consistently decreased diversity of mosses, liverworts and rare bryophyte species at the regional scale. We also found that warmer and drier springs presented fewer bryophyte species. Our results show that the combination of nitrate pollution, increasing temperature and drought could severely threaten bryophyte diversity in Mediterranean springs. Our results indicate that the absence of rare bryophytes could be used as a bioindicator of nitrate pollution in springs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biodiversity loss", "Groundwater", "Intensive farming", "Liverworts", "Mosses"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anthropogenic activity", "Biodiversity loss", "Freshwater ecosystem", "Increasing temperatures", "Intensive farming", "Liverworts", "Mosses", "Nitrate concentration", "Animals", "Biodiversity", "Bryophyta", "Ecosystem", "Natural Springs", "Nitrates"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076605194", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Waste Management and Disposal", "ENVI", "2311"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"]], "AuthorData": {"55241379200": {"Name": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Mart\u00ednez M.", "AuthorID": "55241379200", "AffiliationID": "123155042", "AffiliationName": "Delegaci\u00f3 de la Serralada Litoral Central (ICHN)"}, "35902200900": {"Name": "Corbera J.", "AuthorID": "35902200900", "AffiliationID": "123155042", "AffiliationName": "Delegaci\u00f3 de la Serralada Litoral Central (ICHN)"}, "7003489403": {"Name": "Sabater F.", "AuthorID": "7003489403", "AffiliationID": "60001576", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ecology, University of Barcelona"}, "8895741100": {"Name": "Domene X.", "AuthorID": "8895741100", "AffiliationID": "60022367", "AffiliationName": "CREAF"}, "55240330800": {"Name": "Preece C.", "AuthorID": "55240330800", "AffiliationID": "60023020, 60006754, 60022367", "AffiliationName": "CSIC, Global Ecology Unit, CREAF-CSIC-UAB"}, "57148498300": {"Name": "Sayol F.", "AuthorID": "57148498300", "AffiliationID": "119428191", "AffiliationName": "Gothenburg Global Biodiversity Centre (GGBC)"}}}
