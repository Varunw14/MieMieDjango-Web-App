Epilepsia published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of International League Against EpilepsyObjectives: Hypoxia, or abnormally low blood-oxygen levels, often accompanies seizures and may elicit brain structural changes in people with epilepsy which contribute to central processes underlying sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). The extent to which hypoxia may be related to brain structural alterations in this patient group remains unexplored. Methods: We analyzed high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine brain morphometric and volumetric alterations in people with generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) recorded during long-term video-electroencephalography (VEEG), recruited from two sites (n = 22), together with data from age- and sex-matched healthy controls (n = 43). Subjects were sub-divided into those with mild/moderate (GTCS-hypox-mild/moderate, n = 12) and severe (GTCS-hypox-severe, n = 10) hypoxia, measured by peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) during VEEG. Whole-brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and regional volumetry were used to assess group comparisons and correlations between brain structural measurements as well as the duration and extent of hypoxia during GTCS. Results: Morphometric and volumetric alterations appeared in association with peri-GTCS hypoxia, including volume loss in the periaqueductal gray (PAG), thalamus, hypothalamus, vermis, cerebellum, parabrachial pons, and medulla. Thalamic and PAG volume was significantly reduced in GTCS patients with severe hypoxia compared with GTCS patients with mild/moderate hypoxia. Brainstem volume loss appeared in both hypoxia groups, although it was more extensive in those with severe hypoxia. Significant negative partial correlations emerged between thalamic and hippocampal volume and extent of hypoxia, whereas vermis and accumbens volumes declined with increasing hypoxia duration. Significance: Brain structural alterations in patients with GTCS are related to the extent of hypoxia in brain sites that serve vital functions. Although the changes are associative only, they provide evidence of injury to regulatory brain sites related to respiratory manifestations of seizures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["epilepsy", "hypoxia", "MRI", "SUDEP"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Brain", "Case-Control Studies", "Electroencephalography", "Epilepsy, Tonic-Clonic", "Female", "Gray Matter", "Humans", "Hypoxia", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Organ Size", "Prospective Studies", "Sleep", "Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy", "Time Factors", "Video Recording", "White Matter", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088049592", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57196213595": {"Name": "Allen L.A.", "AuthorID": "57196213595", "AffiliationID": "60013780", "AffiliationName": "The Center for SUDEP Research, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"}, "7403429681": {"Name": "Scott C.A.", "AuthorID": "7403429681", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurophysiology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCLH"}, "7006607653": {"Name": "Winston J.S.", "AuthorID": "7006607653", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "56915894100": {"Name": "Whatley B.P.", "AuthorID": "56915894100", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "24172309000": {"Name": "Winston G.P.", "AuthorID": "24172309000", "AffiliationID": "60016005", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, Queen's University"}, "7005729118": {"Name": "Lemieux L.", "AuthorID": "7005729118", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7003810636": {"Name": "Diehl B.", "AuthorID": "7003810636", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurophysiology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCLH"}, "35361154800": {"Name": "Harper R.M.", "AuthorID": "35361154800", "AffiliationID": "60005247, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA"}, "36931857600": {"Name": "Vos S.B.", "AuthorID": "36931857600", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neuroradiological Academic Unit, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "54934577100": {"Name": "Lacuey N.", "AuthorID": "54934577100", "AffiliationID": "60027512", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Texas Health Sciences Center at Houston"}, "57192556111": {"Name": "Vilella L.", "AuthorID": "57192556111", "AffiliationID": "60027512", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Texas Health Sciences Center at Houston"}, "57092301200": {"Name": "Kumar R.", "AuthorID": "57092301200", "AffiliationID": "60005247, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesiology, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA"}, "22980994100": {"Name": "Ogren J.", "AuthorID": "22980994100", "AffiliationID": "60005247, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA"}, "35482407900": {"Name": "Lhatoo S.D.", "AuthorID": "35482407900", "AffiliationID": "60027512", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Texas Health Sciences Center at Houston"}, "57209717771": {"Name": "Hampson J.S.", "AuthorID": "57209717771", "AffiliationID": "60027512", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Texas Health Sciences Center at Houston"}, "57196187716": {"Name": "Rani S.", "AuthorID": "57196187716", "AffiliationID": "60027512", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Texas Health Sciences Center at Houston"}}}
