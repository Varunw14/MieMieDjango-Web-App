We now know that the core regulatory machinery is highly conserved in eukaryotes, but how these multiple protein kinases, protein phosphatases, and ubiquitin ligases are coordinated in space and time to remodel the cell in a matter of minutes remains a major question. Cyclin B1-Cdk is the primary kinase that drives mitotic remodeling; here we show that it is targeted to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) by binding an acidic face of the kinetochore checkpoint protein, MAD1, where it coordinates NPC disassembly with kinetochore assembly. Localized cyclin B1-Cdk1 is needed for the proper release of MAD1 from the embrace of TPR at the nuclear pore so that it can be recruited to kinetochores before nuclear envelope breakdown to maintain genomic stability.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082106554", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"7003848277": {"Name": "Jackman M.", "AuthorID": "7003848277", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Research"}, "54789939800": {"Name": "Marcozzi C.", "AuthorID": "54789939800", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Research"}, "56458576300": {"Name": "Barbiero M.", "AuthorID": "56458576300", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Research"}, "8781730100": {"Name": "Pardo M.", "AuthorID": "8781730100", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Research"}, "57216199105": {"Name": "Yu L.", "AuthorID": "57216199105", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Research"}, "56574880400": {"Name": "Tyson A.L.", "AuthorID": "56574880400", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Research"}, "7003922280": {"Name": "Choudhary J.S.", "AuthorID": "7003922280", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Research"}, "56227919300": {"Name": "Pines J.", "AuthorID": "56227919300", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Research"}}}
