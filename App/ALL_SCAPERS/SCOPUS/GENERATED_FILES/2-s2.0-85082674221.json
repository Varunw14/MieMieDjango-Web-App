However, tightly focused Gaussian beams lead to beam \u00e2\u20ac walk-off' within the etalon cavity which reduces sensitivity. In previous work, the planar geometry of the Fabry-P\u00e9rot etalon has been replaced by a curved geometry matched to the interrogation beam geometry, thus preventing walk-off. In this work we instead propose using propagation invariant Bessel beams, thus matching the beam geometry to that of the planar etalon geometry, to reduce beam walk-off and increase sensitivity. Increased sensitivity may extend the imaging depth of Fabry-P\u00e9rot ultrasound detection systems and may thus enable photoacoustic imaging to access a range of deep tissue imaging applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Beam Confinement", "Bessel Beam", "Fabry-P\u00e9rot Etalons", "Photoacoustic imaging", "Sensitivity", "Sensors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Beam confinement", "Bessel beam", "Deep tissue imaging", "Focused Gaussian beam", "Photo-acoustic imaging", "Sensitivity", "Ultrasound detection", "Ultrasound detectors"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082674221", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57216157254": {"Name": "Sheppard O.J.", "AuthorID": "57216157254", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department Medical Physics &biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "44061273200": {"Name": "Guggenheim J.A.", "AuthorID": "44061273200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department Medical Physics &biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57198317199": {"Name": "Marques D.M.", "AuthorID": "57198317199", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department Medical Physics &biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "24069910700": {"Name": "Ansari R.", "AuthorID": "24069910700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department Medical Physics &biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7102686951": {"Name": "Zhang E.Z.", "AuthorID": "7102686951", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department Medical Physics &biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006238023": {"Name": "Beard P.C.", "AuthorID": "7006238023", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department Medical Physics &biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7102012051": {"Name": "Munro P.R.T.", "AuthorID": "7102012051", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department Medical Physics &biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
