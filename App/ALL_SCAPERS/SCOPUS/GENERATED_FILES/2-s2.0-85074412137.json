Based on the indirect clinical evidence that interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a key additional candidate mediator of ME, we interrogated the effect of IL-6 on blood-retinal barrier (BRB) integrity in vitro. Methods: Human retinal pigment epithelial cell (ARPE-19) and human retinal microvascular endothelial cell (HRMEC) monolayers were used to mimic the outer and inner BRB, respectively. Their paracellular permeability was assessed by measuring the passive permeation of 40 kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran across confluent cells in the presence of IL-6. Transendothelial/epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) then was measured and the distribution of the tight junction protein ZO-1 was assessed by immunofluorescence using confocal microscopy. Results: Treatment with IL-6 for 48 hours significantly increased the diffusion rate of FITC-dextran, decreased TEER, and disrupted the distribution of ZO-1 in ARPE-19 cells, which constitutively express the IL-6 transmembrane receptor, and this was reversed with IL-6R blockade. In contrast, IL-6 did not affect the paracellular permeability, TEER, or ZO-1 distribution in HRMECs. Conclusions: These in vitro data support the hypothesis that IL-6 reversibly disrupts the integrity of ARPE-19 cells, but it does not affect HRMECs. Translational Relevance: IL-6 is a candidate therapeutic target in the treatment of outer BRB driven ME.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blood retinal barrier", "Inflammation", "Interleukin-6", "Macular edema"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074412137", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"36128734800": {"Name": "Mesquida M.", "AuthorID": "36128734800", "AffiliationID": "60008201", "AffiliationName": "Roche Pharma Research and Early Development, Roche Innocation Centre Basel"}, "6504768950": {"Name": "Lloren\u00e7 V.", "AuthorID": "6504768950", "AffiliationID": "60030315, 60010814", "AffiliationName": "Institut d\u2019Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Hospital Cl\u00ednic de Barcelona"}, "7004085757": {"Name": "De La Maza M.S.", "AuthorID": "7004085757", "AffiliationID": "60030315, 60010814", "AffiliationName": "Institut d\u2019Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Hospital Cl\u00ednic de Barcelona"}, "57216108733": {"Name": "Adan A.", "AuthorID": "57216108733", "AffiliationID": "60030315, 60010814", "AffiliationName": "Institut d\u2019Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Hospital Cl\u00ednic de Barcelona"}, "16646611600": {"Name": "Molins B.", "AuthorID": "16646611600", "AffiliationID": "60030315, 60010814", "AffiliationName": "Institut d\u2019Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Hospital Cl\u00ednic de Barcelona"}, "26032030000": {"Name": "Drawnel F.", "AuthorID": "26032030000", "AffiliationID": "60008201", "AffiliationName": "Roche Pharma Research and Early Development, Roche Innocation Centre Basel"}, "57191838896": {"Name": "Widmer G.", "AuthorID": "57191838896", "AffiliationID": "60008201", "AffiliationName": "Roche Pharma Research and Early Development, Roche Innocation Centre Basel"}, "57191841656": {"Name": "Strassburger P.", "AuthorID": "57191841656", "AffiliationID": "60008201", "AffiliationName": "Roche Pharma Research and Early Development, Roche Innocation Centre Basel"}, "15024034800": {"Name": "Fauser S.", "AuthorID": "15024034800", "AffiliationID": "60008201", "AffiliationName": "Roche Pharma Research and Early Development, Roche Innocation Centre Basel"}, "8520506800": {"Name": "Lait P.J.", "AuthorID": "8520506800", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Ophthalmology, Translational Health Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "57197345814": {"Name": "Copland D.A.", "AuthorID": "57197345814", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Ophthalmology, Translational Health Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "56780194200": {"Name": "Stimpson M.L.", "AuthorID": "56780194200", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Ophthalmology, Translational Health Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "7103296976": {"Name": "Dick A.D.", "AuthorID": "7103296976", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital, University College London Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "55712827400": {"Name": "Lee R.W.J.", "AuthorID": "55712827400", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital, University College London Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
