Importantly the combination of these techniques with the inverse micelle approach affords us detailed insight and to rationalize the evolving molecular chemistry and how this drives the formation of the Au NPs. We observe that the mechanism comprises three key steps: an initial fast reduction of molecular Au(iii) species to molecular Au(i)Cl; the latter species are often very unstable during the self-assembly process. This is followed by a gradual reduction of these molecular Au(i) species and the formation of sub-nanometric Au clusters which coalesce into nanoparticles. It was also found that addition of small amounts of HCl can accelerate the formation of the Au clusters (the second phase) without affecting the final particle size or its particle size distribution. These findings would help us to understand the reaction mechanism of Au NP formation as well as providing insights into how NP properties could be further tailored for a wide range of practical applications.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Inverse micelles", "Molecular chemistry", "Nanometrics", "Reaction mechanism", "Second phase", "Self assembly process", "UV-vis spectroscopy", "X-ray techniques"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090816479", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57194760959": {"Name": "Decarolis D.", "AuthorID": "57194760959", "AffiliationID": "113255163", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell (RCaH)"}, "55211283400": {"Name": "Odarchenko Y.", "AuthorID": "55211283400", "AffiliationID": "113255163", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell (RCaH)"}, "57190445162": {"Name": "Herbert J.J.", "AuthorID": "57190445162", "AffiliationID": "60032633", "AffiliationName": "Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO), Dubble CRG@ESRF"}, "57218927893": {"Name": "Qiu C.", "AuthorID": "57218927893", "AffiliationID": "113255163", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell (RCaH)"}, "8889480300": {"Name": "Beale A.M.", "AuthorID": "8889480300", "AffiliationID": "113255163", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell (RCaH)"}, "7102541725": {"Name": "Longo A.", "AuthorID": "7102541725", "AffiliationID": "60008737, 60021199", "AffiliationName": "Istituto per Lo Studio Dei Materiali Nanostrutturati, Sezione di Palermo, Consiglio Nazionale Delle Ricerche"}}}
