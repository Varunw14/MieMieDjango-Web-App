The problem is challenging because different illumination conditions, bleeding, smoke and occlusions can reduce algorithm robustness. At present labelled data for training deep learning models is still lacking for semantic surgical instrument segmentation and in this paper we show that it may be possible to use robot kinematic data coupled with laparoscopic images to alleviate the labelling problem. We propose a new deep learning based model for parallel processing of both laparoscopic and simulation images for robust segmentation of surgical tools. Due to the lack of laparoscopic frames annotated with both segmentation ground truth and kinematic information a new custom dataset was generated using the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) and is made available.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Computer assisted interventions", "Instrument detection and segmentation", "Surgical vision"], "IndexKeywords": ["Illumination conditions", "Kinematic information", "Learning Based Models", "Parallel processing", "Robotic automation", "Robust segmentation", "Scene understanding", "Surgical instrument"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092722824", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57188964454": {"Name": "Colleoni E.", "AuthorID": "57188964454", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7401881894": {"Name": "Edwards P.", "AuthorID": "7401881894", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "57217833493": {"Name": "Stoyanov D.", "AuthorID": "57217833493", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
