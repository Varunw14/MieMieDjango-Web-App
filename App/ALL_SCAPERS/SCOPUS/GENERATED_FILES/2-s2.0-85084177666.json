Analysis of a wide range of documents and texts emerging from the Higher Education (HE) sector suggest that information literacy (IL) is shaped by two competing and incongruent narratives. The outward facing narrative of information literacy (located in information literacy standards and guidelines) positions information literacy as an empowering practice that arms students with the knowledge and skills to battle the complexity of the modern information world. In contrast, the inward facing narrative (located in information literacy texts) positions students as lacking appropriate knowledge, skills and agency. This deficit perception, which has the capacity to influence pedagogical practice, is at odds with constructivist and action-oriented views that are espoused within information literacy instructional pedagogy. This presentation represents the first paper in a research programme that interrogates the epistemological premises and discourses of information literacy within HE.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Discourse analysis", "Information literacy", "Positioning theory"], "IndexKeywords": ["Action-oriented", "Higher education", "Information literacy", "Instructional pedagogy", "Pedagogical practices", "Research programmes", "Standards and guidelines"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084177666", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"25627791300": {"Name": "Hicks A.", "AuthorID": "25627791300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College, London (UCL)"}, "35614004000": {"Name": "Lloyd A.", "AuthorID": "35614004000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College, London (UCL)"}}}
