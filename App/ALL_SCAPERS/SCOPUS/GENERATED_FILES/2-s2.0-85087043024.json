Little is known about whether or how sexual minority people\u2019s sexuality education experiences have varied across sociohistorical contexts of rapid social change in both sexuality education and sexual minority visibility. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted among 191 sexual minority people from three distinct sociohistorical generations (ages 18\u201325, 34\u201341, and 52\u201359, respectively) and four geographic regions of the United States. Data were analyzed using thematic content analysis following a consensual qualitative protocol. Fifty-one participants (i.e., 27%) discussed school-based sexuality education experiences despite the lack of an explicit question in the interview protocol prompting them to do so. Four distinct yet overlapping themes emerged in participants\u2019 experiences of sexuality education: 1) Silence; 2) The profound influence of HIV/AIDS; 3) Stigma manifest through fear, shame, and prejudice; and, 4) Comparing school-based experiences to sexuality education outside of school. The presence of themes varied across groups defined by sociohistorical generation. The implications of sexuality education experiences for the wellbeing of sexual minority people are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087043024", "SubjectAreas": [["Gender Studies", "SOCI", "3318"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["History and Philosophy of Science", "ARTS", "1207"]], "AuthorData": {"57212211807": {"Name": "Bishop M.D.", "AuthorID": "57212211807", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Development and Family Sciences, University of Texas at Austin"}, "56525340300": {"Name": "Mallory A.B.", "AuthorID": "56525340300", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Development and Family Sciences, University of Texas at Austin"}, "57212211915": {"Name": "Gessner M.", "AuthorID": "57212211915", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Development and Family Sciences, University of Texas at Austin"}, "7401538008": {"Name": "Russell S.T.", "AuthorID": "7401538008", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Development and Family Sciences, University of Texas at Austin"}, "12807081700": {"Name": "Frost D.M.", "AuthorID": "12807081700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Science, University College London"}}}
