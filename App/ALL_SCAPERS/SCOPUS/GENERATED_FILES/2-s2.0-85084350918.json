A comprehensive analysis of fossil fuel consumption is useful for policymakers to reduce demand but still absent. This study explores the national contribution to global energy consumption from different perspectives in the global supply chain and is designed to complement current energy reduction policies. For the developed countries, energy consumptions are stable from 2000 to 2014, while that of emerging countries almost doubled (e.g., China and India). Most of the developing countries are producers whose production-based and final production-based energy consumptions are higher than their consumption-based ones, except India after the global financial crisis. In contrast, the developed countries are consumers, whose consumption-based energy consumptions are higher. At the sectoral level, the service sector is the largest contributor to consumption- and income-based energy consumption. The analysis in this study can create opportunities for all the parties alongside the supply chain in reducing fossil fuel consumption.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Consumption-based", "Energy consumption", "Income-based", "Inequality", "Production-based"], "IndexKeywords": ["China", "Fossil Fuels", "Income", "India", "Socioeconomic Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084350918", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Waste Management and Disposal", "ENVI", "2311"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"55975044300": {"Name": "Meng J.", "AuthorID": "55975044300", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London"}, "56603101200": {"Name": "Coffman D.M.", "AuthorID": "56603101200", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London"}, "55496233700": {"Name": "Hu X.", "AuthorID": "55496233700", "AffiliationID": "60013141", "AffiliationName": "Industrial Ecology Programme, Department of Energy and Process Engineering, Norwegian University of Science and Technology"}, "57203988041": {"Name": "Chen P.", "AuthorID": "57203988041", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "55755562600": {"Name": "Han M.", "AuthorID": "55755562600", "AffiliationID": "60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Regional Sustainable Development Modeling, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}}}
