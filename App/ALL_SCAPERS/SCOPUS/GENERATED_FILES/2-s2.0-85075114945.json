In occidental societies, homosexual men are feminized at various levels and they have more older brothers than heterosexual men. To evaluate whether femininity and the fraternal birth order (FBO) effect are universal features of MHP or not, we collected original data from homosexual men, heterosexual men, and heterosexual women from Java (Indonesia). Facial photographs were used to test whether homosexual faces are feminized when compared with heterosexual ones. We found that faces manipulated to resemble the average face of homosexual men are perceived as facially feminized, suggesting that homosexual men are facially feminized compared to heterosexual men, although a higher facial femininity was not captured by morphological analyses. Then, family data were used to detect differences in siblings\u2019 composition between homosexuals and heterosexuals. Homosexual men displayed a higher number of older brothers than heterosexual men, even when sibship size was controlled for, suggesting that the FBO effect exists in Indonesian populations. Independent of sexual orientation, men with older brothers seem more feminized than those without older brothers, consistent with the immune origin of the FBO effect. In conclusion, MHP in Indonesia is partially feminized and they have more older brothers. Such features are also associated with MHP in other cultural contexts, suggesting a cross-cultural effect of men homosexual preference. An evolutionary explanation is available for the feminizing effect, although the FBO effect remains unexplained even if proximal mechanisms start to be identified.", "AuthorKeywords": ["facial morphology", "fraternal birth order effect", "homosexuality", "sexual dimorphism", "sexual orientation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Birth Order", "Facial Recognition", "Female", "Femininity", "Heterosexuality", "Homosexuality, Male", "Humans", "Indonesia", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Social Perception", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075114945", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"57004771700": {"Name": "Nila S.", "AuthorID": "57004771700", "AffiliationID": "60069381", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, IPB University (Bogor Agricultural University)"}, "57196435939": {"Name": "Rianti P.", "AuthorID": "57196435939", "AffiliationID": "60069381", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, IPB University (Bogor Agricultural University)"}, "35105051700": {"Name": "Juliandi B.", "AuthorID": "35105051700", "AffiliationID": "60069381", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, IPB University (Bogor Agricultural University)"}, "6602437103": {"Name": "Suryobroto B.", "AuthorID": "6602437103", "AffiliationID": "60069381", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, IPB University (Bogor Agricultural University)"}, "36926549400": {"Name": "Crochet P.A.", "AuthorID": "36926549400", "AffiliationID": "60108488, 60008134, 60027946, 60068952, 60009278", "AffiliationName": "CEFE, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier, Universit\u00e9 Paul-Val\u00e9ry Montpellier, EPHE"}, "57197118236": {"Name": "Barthes J.", "AuthorID": "57197118236", "AffiliationID": "60108488, 60028993, 60008134, 60027946", "AffiliationName": "ISEM, Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier, CNRS, IRD, EPHE"}, "7101671787": {"Name": "Raymond M.", "AuthorID": "7101671787", "AffiliationID": "60108488, 60028993, 60008134, 60027946", "AffiliationName": "ISEM, Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier, CNRS, IRD, EPHE"}}}
