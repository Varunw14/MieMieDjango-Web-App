Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe ability to manipulate cellular organization within soft materials has important potential in biomedicine and regenerative medicine; however, it often requires complex fabrication procedures. Here, a simple, cost-effective, and one-step approach that enables the control of cell orientation within 3D collagen hydrogels is developed to dynamically create various tailored microstructures of cardiac tissues. This is achieved by incorporating iron oxide nanoparticles into human cardiomyocytes and applying a short-term external magnetic field to orient the cells along the applied field to impart different shapes without any mechanical support. The patterned constructs are viable and functional, can be detected by T2*-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and induce no alteration to normal cardiac function after grafting onto rat hearts. This strategy paves the way to creating customized, macroscale, 3D tissue constructs with various cell-types for therapeutic and bioengineering applications, as well as providing powerful models for investigating tissue behavior.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cardiac tissues", "cellular organization", "hydrogels", "magnetic nanoparticles", "patterning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cardiac tissues", "Cellular organization", "External magnetic field", "Fabrication procedure", "Iron oxide nanoparticle", "Magnetic nano-particles", "Mechanical support", "patterning", "Biocompatible Materials", "Cell Line", "Collagen", "Equipment Design", "Humans", "Hydrogels", "Magnetic Fields", "Magnetite Nanoparticles", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "Tissue Engineering", "Tissue Scaffolds"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076380204", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"36770011900": {"Name": "Zwi-Dantsis L.", "AuthorID": "36770011900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Department of Bioengineering, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "57212267443": {"Name": "Marijon C.", "AuthorID": "57212267443", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Department of Bioengineering, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "57204609786": {"Name": "Massi L.", "AuthorID": "57204609786", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Department of Bioengineering, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "7402243195": {"Name": "Stevens M.M.", "AuthorID": "7402243195", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Department of Bioengineering, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "57212269717": {"Name": "Wang B.", "AuthorID": "57212269717", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart & Lung Institute, Imperial College London, The Hammersmith Hospital"}, "57212272502": {"Name": "Ferrini A.", "AuthorID": "57212272502", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart & Lung Institute, Imperial College London, The Hammersmith Hospital"}, "7003667695": {"Name": "Terracciano C.M.", "AuthorID": "7003667695", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart & Lung Institute, Imperial College London, The Hammersmith Hospital"}, "57212273578": {"Name": "Zonetti S.", "AuthorID": "57212273578", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus"}, "14820025000": {"Name": "Stuckey D.J.", "AuthorID": "14820025000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, University College London"}}}
