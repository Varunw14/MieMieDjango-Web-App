We coupled a flexible chemical kinetics scheme to the Met Office Unified Model, which enables the study of the interaction of chemistry, radiative transfer, and fluid dynamics. We used a newly-released \"reduced\" chemical network, comprising 30 chemical species, that was specifically developed for its application in 3D atmosphere models. We simulated the atmospheres of the well-studied hot Jupiters HD 209458b and HD 189733b which both have dayside-nightside temperature contrasts of several hundred Kelvin and superrotating equatorial jets. We find qualitatively quite different chemical structures between the two planets, particularly for methane (CH4), when advection of chemical species is included. Our results show that consideration of 3D chemical transport is vital in understanding the chemical composition of hot Jupiter atmospheres. Three-dimensional mixing leads to significant changes in the abundances of absorbing gas-phase species compared with what would be expected by assuming local chemical equilibrium, or from models including 1D - and even 2D - chemical mixing. We find that CH4, carbon dioxide (CO2), and ammonia (NH3) are particularly interesting as 3D mixing of these species leads to prominent signatures of out-of-equilibrium chemistry in the transmission and emission spectra, which are detectable with near-future instruments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Planets and satellites: atmospheres", "Planets and satellites: composition", "Planets and satellites: gaseous planets"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chemical compositions", "Emission spectrums", "Local chemical equilibrium", "Out of equilibrium", "Radiation hydrodynamics", "Temperature contrast", "Three dimensional chemicals", "Threedimensional (3-d)"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083846962", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"56942309200": {"Name": "Drummond B.", "AuthorID": "56942309200", "AffiliationID": "60018258", "AffiliationName": "Met Office"}, "15033163800": {"Name": "H\u00e9brard E.", "AuthorID": "15033163800", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Astrophysics Group, University of Exeter"}, "16022263500": {"Name": "Mayne N.J.", "AuthorID": "16022263500", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Astrophysics Group, University of Exeter"}, "57216547060": {"Name": "Ridgway R.J.", "AuthorID": "57216547060", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Astrophysics Group, University of Exeter"}, "57221139349": {"Name": "Kohary K.", "AuthorID": "57221139349", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Astrophysics Group, University of Exeter"}, "26659116700": {"Name": "Manners J.", "AuthorID": "26659116700", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Global Systems Institute, University of Exeter"}, "55383456100": {"Name": "Venot O.", "AuthorID": "55383456100", "AffiliationID": "60122451, 60019908, 60025066", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire Interuniversitaire des Syst\u00e8mes Atmosph\u00e9riques (LISA), UMR CNRS 7583, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Est-Cr\u00e9teil, Universit\u00e9 de Paris, Institut Pierre Simon Laplace"}, "57212672802": {"Name": "Changeat Q.", "AuthorID": "57212672802", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57061487100": {"Name": "Tsai S.M.", "AuthorID": "57061487100", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Atmospheric, Oceanic, and Planetary Physics Department, Clarendon Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "35321650700": {"Name": "Tremblin P.", "AuthorID": "35321650700", "AffiliationID": "60106225, 60029937, 60106017, 60008134, 60007816", "AffiliationName": "Maison de la Simulation, CEA, CNRS, Univ.
