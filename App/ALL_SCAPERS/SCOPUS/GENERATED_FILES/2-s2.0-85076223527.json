We adapt the recent idea of Image Quality Transfer (IQT) to enhance very low-field structural images aiming to estimate the resolution, spatial coverage, and contrast of high-field images. Analogous to many learning-based image enhancement techniques, IQT generates training data from high-field scans alone by simulating low-field images through a pre-defined decimation model. However, the ground truth decimation model is not well-known in practice, and lack of its specification can bias the trained model, aggravating performance on the real low-field scans. In this paper we propose a probabilistic decimation simulator to improve robustness of model training. It is used to generate and augment various low-field images whose parameters are random variables and sampled from an empirical distribution related to tissue-specific SNR on a 0.36T scanner. The probabilistic decimation simulator is model-agnostic, that is, it can be used with any super-resolution networks. Furthermore we propose a variant of U-Net architecture to improve its learning performance. We show promising qualitative results from clinical low-field images confirming the strong efficacy of IQT in an important new application area: epilepsy diagnosis in sub-Saharan Africa where only low-field scanners are normally available.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Empirical distributions", "Learning performance", "Low magnetic fields", "New applications", "Robustness of model", "Spatial coverage", "Sub-saharan africa", "Tissue specifics"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076223527", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57212004415": {"Name": "Lin H.", "AuthorID": "57212004415", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing and Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "55796625500": {"Name": "Figini M.", "AuthorID": "55796625500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing and Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "57192061942": {"Name": "Tanno R.", "AuthorID": "57192061942", "AffiliationID": "60098463", "AffiliationName": "Machine Intelligence and Perception Group, Microsoft Research Cambridge"}, "57204343690": {"Name": "Blumberg S.B.", "AuthorID": "57204343690", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing and Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "21834356800": {"Name": "Kaden E.", "AuthorID": "21834356800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing and Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "8942330100": {"Name": "Fernandez-Reyes D.", "AuthorID": "8942330100", "AffiliationID": "60006270", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan"}, "7402830766": {"Name": "Alexander D.C.", "AuthorID": "7402830766", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing and Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "22938693200": {"Name": "Ogbole G.", "AuthorID": "22938693200", "AffiliationID": "60006270", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan"}, "25957585900": {"Name": "Brown B.J.", "AuthorID": "25957585900", "AffiliationID": "60006270", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan"}, "35610189800": {"Name": "Lagunju I.", "AuthorID": "35610189800", "AffiliationID": "60006270", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan"}, "57196118971": {"Name": "D\u2019Arco F.", "AuthorID": "57196118971", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "19834317000": {"Name": "Cross H.J.", "AuthorID": "19834317000", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "8588211000": {"Name": "Carmichael D.W.", "AuthorID": "8588211000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, King\u2019s College London"}}}
