In the context of invasion ecology, macroecological studies include, for example, analyses of the richness, diversity, distribution, and abundance of alien species in regional floras and faunas, spatio-temporal dynamics of alien species across regions, and cross-taxonomic analyses of species traits among comparable native and alien species pools. However, macroecological studies aiming to explain and predict plant and animal naturalisations and invasions, and the resulting impacts, have, to date, rarely considered the joint effects of species traits, environment, and socioeconomic characteristics. To address this, we present the MAcroecological Framework for Invasive Aliens (MAFIA). The MAFIA explains the invasion phenomenon using three interacting classes of factors \u2013 alien species traits, location characteristics, and factors related to introduction events \u2013 and explicitly maps these interactions onto the invasion sequence from transport to naturalisation to invasion. The framework therefore helps both to identify how anthropogenic effects interact with species traits and environmental characteristics to determine observed patterns in alien distribution, abundance, and richness; and to clarify why neglecting anthropogenic effects can generate spurious conclusions. Event-related factors include propagule pressure, colonisation pressure, and residence time that are important for mediating the outcome of invasion processes. However, because of context dependence, they can bias analyses, for example those that seek to elucidate the role of alien species traits. In the same vein, failure to recognise and explicitly incorporate interactions among the main factors impedes our understanding of which macroecological invasion patterns are shaped by the environment, and of the importance of interactions between the species and their environment. The MAFIA is based largely on insights from studies of plants and birds, but we believe it can be applied to all taxa, and hope that it will stimulate comparative research on other groups and environments. By making the biases in macroecological analyses of biological invasions explicit, the MAFIA offers an opportunity to guide assessments of the context dependence of invasions at broad geographical scales.", "AuthorKeywords": ["climate", "colonisation pressure", "geographic range", "habitats", "invasion stages", "non-native", "propagule pressure", "residence time", "species traits", "vertebrates"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85097534843", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Animal Science and Zoology", "AGRI", "1103"], ["Ecological Modeling", "ENVI", "2302"], ["Plant Science", "AGRI", "1110"], ["Insect Science", "AGRI", "1109"]], "AuthorData": {"7004095579": {"Name": "Py\u0161ek P.", "AuthorID": "7004095579", "AffiliationID": "60001565", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Invasion Biology, Department of Botany & Zoology, Stellenbosch University"}, "55539325600": {"Name": "Novoa A.", "AuthorID": "55539325600", "AffiliationID": "60031135, 60045994", "AffiliationName": "Czech Academy of Sciences, Institute of Botany, Department of Invasion Ecology"}, "8965078000": {"Name": "Pergl J.", "AuthorID": "8965078000", "AffiliationID": "60031135, 60045994", "AffiliationName": "Czech Academy of Sciences, Institute of Botany, Department of Invasion Ecology"}, "7403444596": {"Name": "Richardson D.M.", "AuthorID": "7403444596", "AffiliationID": "60001565", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Invasion Biology, Department of Botany & Zoology, Stellenbosch University"}, "55495798500": {"Name": "Wilson J.R.U.", "AuthorID": "55495798500", "AffiliationID": "60029287", "AffiliationName": "South African National Biodiversity Institute, Kirstenbosch Research Centre"}, "7102086774": {"Name": "Blackburn T.M.", "AuthorID": "7102086774", "AffiliationID": "60009498, 60005453", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "7004033052": {"Name": "Bacher S.", "AuthorID": "7004033052", "AffiliationID": "60024631", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Fribourg"}, "7005445011": {"Name": "K\u00fchn I.", "AuthorID": "7005445011", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig"}, "23476479900": {"Name": "Catford J.A.", "AuthorID": "23476479900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, King\u2019s College London"}, "7006913433": {"Name": "Hulme P.E.", "AuthorID": "7006913433", "AffiliationID": "60006625", "AffiliationName": "The Bio-Protection Research Centre, Lincoln University"}}}
