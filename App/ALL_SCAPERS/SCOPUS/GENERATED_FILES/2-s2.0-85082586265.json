All rights reserved.The GoGreenGas partners have built a commercial plant in the UK to demonstrate the technical and economic viability of producing green gas through the gasification of household waste. The plant will process 10,000 tonnes per annum of refuse-derived fuel and waste wood to produce 22 GWh per annum of grid-quality natural gas, enough to heat 1500 homes or power 75 heavy goods vehicles. The facility has been constructed in Swindon (UK) following the successful operation of a smaller demonstration plant (150 kWth output). The project combines a two-stage plasma-assisted gasification technology (also known as Gasplasma), which produces a high-quality, tar-fee syngas from biomass and household waste feedstocks, with Amec Foster Wheeler\u2019s Vesta technology, which converts the syngas to green natural gas. This chapter describes the outline design of commercial bio-SNG facilities developed in the GoGreenGas project and validated by the results from the demonstration plant in Swindon. The designs show the technical feasibility of bio-SNG production and underpin the economic assessment set out.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bio-sng", "Gasification", "Green gas", "Household waste", "Refuse-derived fuel"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082586265", "SubjectAreas": [["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"]], "AuthorData": {"55623473200": {"Name": "Materazzi M.", "AuthorID": "55623473200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56196096800": {"Name": "Taylor R.", "AuthorID": "56196096800", "AffiliationID": "60112883", "AffiliationName": "Technical and Operations Department, Go Green Fuels, Advanced Plasma Power"}}}
