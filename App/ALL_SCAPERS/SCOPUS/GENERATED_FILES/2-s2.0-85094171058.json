Internationally, reported DUED ranges from 2.5 to 6 years for different eating disorders (EDs). To shorten DUED, we developed FREED (First Episode Rapid Early Intervention for EDs), a service model and care pathway for emerging adults with EDs. Here, we assess the impact of FREED on DUED in a multi-centre study using a quasi-experimental design. Methods: Two hundred and seventy-eight patients aged 16\u201325, with first episode illness of less than 3 years duration, were recruited from specialist ED services and offered treatment via FREED. These were compared to 224 patients, of similar age and illness duration, seen previously in participating services (treatment as usual [TAU]) on DUED, waiting times and treatment uptake. Results: FREED patients had significantly shorter DUED and waiting times than TAU patients. On average, DUED was reduced by \u223c4 months when systemic delays were minimal. Furthermore, 97.8% of FREED patients took up treatment, versus 75.4% of TAU. Discussion: Findings indicate that FREED significantly improves access to treatment for emerging adults with first episode ED. FREED may reduce distress, prevent deterioration and facilitate recovery.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anorexia nervosa", "binge eating disorder", "bulimia nervosa", "duration of untreated illness", "early intervention", "eating disorders", "FREED"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094171058", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56539353600": {"Name": "Flynn M.", "AuthorID": "56539353600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Medicine, King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience"}, "57211532275": {"Name": "Austin A.", "AuthorID": "57211532275", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Medicine, King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience"}, "55696319500": {"Name": "Lang K.", "AuthorID": "55696319500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Medicine, King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience"}, "22633839000": {"Name": "Allen K.", "AuthorID": "22633839000", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "Eating Disorders Outpatient Service, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6508129252": {"Name": "Mountford V.", "AuthorID": "6508129252", "AffiliationID": "123929244", "AffiliationName": "Maudsley Health"}, "7402009547": {"Name": "Schmidt U.", "AuthorID": "7402009547", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "Eating Disorders Outpatient Service, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57219592272": {"Name": "Bassi R.", "AuthorID": "57219592272", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "Eating Disorders Outpatient Service, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57157969000": {"Name": "Brown A.", "AuthorID": "57157969000", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "Eating Disorders Outpatient Service, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55013463900": {"Name": "Glennon D.", "AuthorID": "55013463900", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "Eating Disorders Outpatient Service, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7102185224": {"Name": "Grant N.", "AuthorID": "7102185224", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "Eating Disorders Outpatient Service, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "44761131800": {"Name": "Koskina A.", "AuthorID": "44761131800", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "Eating Disorders Outpatient Service, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57219594169": {"Name": "Brady G.", "AuthorID": "57219594169", "AffiliationID": "60162114", "AffiliationName": "Vincent Square Eating Disorder Service, Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8746829100": {"Name": "Connan F.", "AuthorID": "8746829100", "AffiliationID": "60162114", "AffiliationName": "Vincent Square Eating Disorder Service, Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57219598086": {"Name": "Kali K.", "AuthorID": "57219598086", "AffiliationID": "60162114", "AffiliationName": "Vincent Square Eating Disorder Service, Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57219593065": {"Name": "Nunes N.", "AuthorID": "57219593065", "AffiliationID": "60162114", "AffiliationName": "Vincent Square Eating Disorder Service, Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57219605044": {"Name": "Franklin-Smith M.", "AuthorID": "57219605044", "AffiliationID": "60170525", "AffiliationName": "Eating Disorder Service, Leeds and York Partnership NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36523140500": {"Name": "Jones W.R.", "AuthorID": "36523140500", "AffiliationID": "60170525", "AffiliationName": "Eating Disorder Service, Leeds and York Partnership NHS Foundation Trust"}, "54888762300": {"Name": "Schelhase M.", "AuthorID": "54888762300", "AffiliationID": "60170525", "AffiliationName": "Eating Disorder Service, Leeds and York Partnership NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57219598853": {"Name": "Mahony K.", "AuthorID": "57219598853", "AffiliationID": "60107401", "AffiliationName": "Eating Disorder Service, North East London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55747914900": {"Name": "Serpell L.", "AuthorID": "55747914900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}}}
