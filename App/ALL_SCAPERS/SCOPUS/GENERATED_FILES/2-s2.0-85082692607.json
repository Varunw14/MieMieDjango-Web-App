The subsequent acquisition of the sarcophagus by John Soane was the catalyst in changing the government attitude to collecting antiquities for the national museum. The acceptance of a proposal made in 1835 by Giovanni D\u2019Athanasi to excavate in Egypt turned the government from a passive recipient into an active collector of antiquities for its museum. These episodes provide insights into the mechanisms by which the British Museum\u2019s collection was established. They also illuminate how collecting by a national museum established an object habit that linked antiquities acquisitions, nationalism, and restitution demands in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.", "AuthorKeywords": ["antiquities", "archaeology", "collecting", "consuls", "digital technologies", "Egypt", "heritage", "Museums", "nationalism", "provenance", "restitution"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082692607", "SubjectAreas": [["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Museology", "ARTS", "1209"], ["Conservation", "ARTS", "1206"]], "AuthorData": {"57216146583": {"Name": "Patrizio Gunning L.", "AuthorID": "57216146583", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of History, University College London"}}}
