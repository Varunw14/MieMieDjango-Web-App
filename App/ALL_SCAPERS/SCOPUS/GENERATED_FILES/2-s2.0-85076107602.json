Applying a single heating rate is not adequate, and thus many melting points in the literature and regulatory documentation are not valid. Our aim was to validate a five-stage approach for the melting point measurement of heat-sensitive drugs. These stages are; (1) observe melting; (2) record mass loss; (3) measure melting points at different heating rates; (4) characterise degradation and (5) test for potential isomerisation. Applying this approach to pilocarpine HCl illustrated the sensitivity of a melting point to thermal degradation. Due to salt disproportionation & loss of HCl gas, pilocarpine's melting point decreased by 14 \u00b0C when the heating rate was lowered from 20 to 1 \u00b0C/min. Epimerization occurred before melting was reached. Increasing the heating rate diminished disproportionation; however, this did not remove epimerization. Thus, the melting point of pilocarpine HCl of 205.5 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b0C measured at 20 \u00b0C/min represents the melt of a racemic mixture containing inactive isopilocarpine. Heating above the melting point accelerated degradation, a rate of 5 \u00b0C/min recovered just 38 \u00b1 1% of pilocarpine. Such data predicted a shelf-life of 6.6 years. Pilocarpine successfully validated the multistage approach by providing new knowledge concerning its thermal stability. Our 5-stage approach must be applied to all new drugs especially if their formulation requires heat. For example, thermal stability is an infrequently considered pre-requisite in the emerging field of 3D printing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Differential scanning calorimetry", "Disproportionation", "Epimerization", "Heat-sensitive drugs", "Melting point", "pilocarpine HCl", "Thermal degradation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Heating", "Hot Temperature", "Pilocarpine", "Thermodynamics", "Transition Temperature"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076107602", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"57200792101": {"Name": "Malallah O.S.", "AuthorID": "57200792101", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences King's, College London"}, "57212171598": {"Name": "Hammond B.", "AuthorID": "57212171598", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences King's, College London"}, "57212169036": {"Name": "Al-Adhami T.", "AuthorID": "57212169036", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences King's, College London"}, "56232895400": {"Name": "Rahman K.M.", "AuthorID": "56232895400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences King's, College London"}, "7005525236": {"Name": "Forbes B.", "AuthorID": "7005525236", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences King's, College London"}, "55989256900": {"Name": "Royall P.G.", "AuthorID": "55989256900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences King's, College London"}, "36020023200": {"Name": "Buanz A.", "AuthorID": "36020023200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57185708900": {"Name": "Alqurshi A.", "AuthorID": "57185708900", "AffiliationID": "60008920", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics and Pharmaceutical Technology, College of Pharmacy, Taibah University"}, "57212165573": {"Name": "Carswell W.D.", "AuthorID": "57212165573", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Interdisciplinary Research Centre in Polymer Science and Technology, University of Durham"}}}
