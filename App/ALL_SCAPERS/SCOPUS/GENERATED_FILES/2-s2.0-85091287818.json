However, BO is practically limited to optimizing 10\u201320 parameters. To scale BO to high dimensions, we usually make structural assumptions on the decomposition of the objective and/or exploit the intrinsic lower dimensionality of the problem, e.g. by using linear projections. We could achieve a higher compression rate with nonlinear projections, but learning these nonlinear embeddings typically requires much data. This contradicts the BO objective of a relatively small evaluation budget. To address this challenge, we propose to learn a low-dimensional feature space jointly with (a) the response surface and (b) a reconstruction mapping. Our approach allows for optimization of BO\u2019s acquisition function in the lower-dimensional subspace, which significantly simplifies the optimization problem. We reconstruct the original parameter space from the lower-dimensional subspace for evaluating the black-box function. For meaningful exploration, we solve a constrained optimization problem.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bayesian optimization", "Black-box functions", "Constrained optimi-zation problems", "Dimensional subspace", "Machine learning models", "Nonlinear projections", "Optimization problems", "Structural assumption"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091287818", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"57209356568": {"Name": "Moriconi R.", "AuthorID": "57209356568", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computing, Imperial College London"}, "24922891000": {"Name": "Deisenroth M.P.", "AuthorID": "24922891000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "56096945700": {"Name": "Sesh Kumar K.S.", "AuthorID": "56096945700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Data Science Institute, Imperial College London"}}}
