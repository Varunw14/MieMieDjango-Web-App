Case specificity of learning outcome elicited by Serious Games has not been studied in detail. This study investigated whether learning outcome elicited by repeated exposure to virtual patient cases is transferable to other cases addressing similar problems. Methods In this monocentric, prospective, randomized trial, 69 fifth-year medical students participated in ten 90-minute sessions of using a computer-based emergency ward simulation game. Students were randomized to 3 groups (A, B, AB) and subsequently exposed to up to 46 different virtual patients. Group A was presented with 2 specific cases that were not shown in group B and vice versa. Group AB was exposed to all 4 specific cases. After 6 weeks of using the game as a learning resource, students were presented with 4 cases addressing similar problems. For each case, an aggregate score reflecting clinical reasoning was calculated, and performance was compared across groups. Results In the final session, there were no significant between-group differences regarding the sum score reflecting aggregated performance in all 4 cases (A: 66.5 \u00b1 7.2% vs. B: 61.9 \u00b1 12.4% vs. AB: 64.8 \u00b1 11.1%, P = 0.399). An item-by-item analysis revealed that there were no between-group differences regarding correct therapeutic interventions. Conclusions Previous exposure had limited impact on subsequent performance in similar cases. This study suggests that case specificity of learning outcome elicited by the serious game is low and that acquired higher-order cognitive functions may transfer to similar virtual patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["case specificity", "clinical reasoning", "Serious Games", "undergraduate medical education"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082881645", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"]], "AuthorData": {"57197750074": {"Name": "Middeke A.", "AuthorID": "57197750074", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medical Education Research and Curriculum Development, Study Deanery of University Medical Centre G\u00f6ttingen, Department of Legal Medicine, University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf"}, "57200811182": {"Name": "Anders S.", "AuthorID": "57200811182", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medical Education Research and Curriculum Development, Study Deanery of University Medical Centre G\u00f6ttingen, Department of Legal Medicine, University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf"}, "23135592200": {"Name": "Raupach T.", "AuthorID": "23135592200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Behaviour Research Centre, University College London"}, "35093126800": {"Name": "Schuelper N.", "AuthorID": "35093126800", "AffiliationID": "60021110", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology and Medical Oncology, University Medical Centre G\u00f6ttingen"}}}
