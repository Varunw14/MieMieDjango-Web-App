The incidence of prosthetic joint infection ranges from 2% to 4% in primary procedures as opposed to nearly 20% in revisions. The challenges that arise here include mainly diagnostic uncertainty, management in immunocompromised patients, recurrent infection, infection around a well-fixed implant, and substantial bone loss, and require careful preoperative assessment and well-defined management plans. This article summarizes recent developments in the diagnosis and management of this increasingly prevalent issue specifically focusing on outcomes following debridement, antibiotics, and implants retention and one-stage revision procedures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dair", "Diagnosis", "One stage", "Prosthetic joint infection", "Two stage"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip", "Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee", "Biomarkers", "Debridement", "Device Removal", "Humans", "Joint Prosthesis", "Prosthesis-Related Infections", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078881381", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"35585275900": {"Name": "Ahmed S.S.", "AuthorID": "35585275900", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Lower Limb Arthroplasty, University College London Hospital"}, "57205598547": {"Name": "Yaghmour K.M.", "AuthorID": "57205598547", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital"}, "7203033976": {"Name": "Haddad F.S.", "AuthorID": "7203033976", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital"}}}
