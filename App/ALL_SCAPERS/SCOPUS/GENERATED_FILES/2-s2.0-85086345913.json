Although electron microscopy is capable of resolving a single particle down to the sub-nm scale, the reliable representation of entire populations is plagued by challenges in providing statistical significance, suboptimal preparation procedures and operator bias. While alternative techniques exist that provide ensemble information in solution, their implementation is generally challenging for non-monodisperse populations. Herein, we explore the use of small-angle X-ray scattering in combination with form-free Monte Carlo fitting of scattering profiles as an alternative to conventional electron microscopy imaging in providing access to any type of core size distribution. We report on a cross-method comparison for quasi-monodisperse, polydisperse and bimodal gold nanoparticles of 2-7 nm in diameter and discuss advantages and limitations of both techniques.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biomedical research", "Core-size distribution", "Method comparison", "Preparation procedures", "Research domains", "Scattering profiles", "Single particle", "Statistical significance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086345913", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57200640493": {"Name": "Yang Y.", "AuthorID": "57200640493", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57204211727": {"Name": "Qi R.", "AuthorID": "57204211727", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57204212322": {"Name": "Mac Fhionnlaoich N.", "AuthorID": "57204212322", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "25927105300": {"Name": "Guldin S.", "AuthorID": "25927105300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57204741479": {"Name": "Liao S.", "AuthorID": "57204741479", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Materials, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL)"}, "57190730570": {"Name": "Luo Z.", "AuthorID": "57190730570", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Materials, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL)"}, "6603088116": {"Name": "Stellacci F.", "AuthorID": "6603088116", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Interfaculty Bioengineering Institute, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL)"}}}
