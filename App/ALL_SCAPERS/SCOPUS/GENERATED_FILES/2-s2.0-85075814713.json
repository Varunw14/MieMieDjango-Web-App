METHODS: A cross-sectional study was undertaken with children who had undergone slide tracheoplasty. Participants included parents and children (age 5-15 years) recruited over a 13-month period, who were asked to complete validated measures of HRQoL, development and behaviour. Scores were compared to published norms. RESULTS: Forty-two children (male 69%; n = 29) were included; mean age was 5.3 (standard deviation 3.5) years and mean follow-up was 45 (range 4-179) months. Mean total HRQoL scores for children with repaired LSTS did not differ from those of healthy norms other than for children aged 13-23 months, but 10 children (24%) had scores >2 SD below the mean for healthy children. HRQoL was poorer in children with non-cardiac congenital comorbidities than in those with isolated LSTS (mean scores 60.34 \u00b1 17.19 and 85.52 \u00b1 12.19, respectively, P = 0.01). There was good agreement between children's and parents' scores, although children rated their HRQoL as better than their parents did. Anxious parents rated their children's HRQoL as significantly worse than non-anxious parents (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Older children with isolated LSTS can have excellent HRQoL after surgery. Younger children, at an earlier time point postoperatively, and those with non-cardiac congenital comorbidities have poorer HRQoL. Further longitudinal evaluation is required to identify psycho-social (including parental) predictors of outcome which may inform, or be amenable to, intervention.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Children", "Development", "Long-segment tracheal stenosis", "Quality of life"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Quality of Life", "Reconstructive Surgical Procedures", "Retrospective Studies", "Trachea", "Tracheal Stenosis", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075814713", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57203081145": {"Name": "Wray J.", "AuthorID": "57203081145", "AffiliationID": "107343571", "AffiliationName": "Heart and Lung Direct., Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57212056043": {"Name": "Ryde M.", "AuthorID": "57212056043", "AffiliationID": "107343571", "AffiliationName": "Heart and Lung Direct., Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "26421052200": {"Name": "Butler C.R.", "AuthorID": "26421052200", "AffiliationID": "107343571", "AffiliationName": "Heart and Lung Direct., Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7102286392": {"Name": "Hewitt R.J.", "AuthorID": "7102286392", "AffiliationID": "107343571", "AffiliationName": "Heart and Lung Direct., Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
