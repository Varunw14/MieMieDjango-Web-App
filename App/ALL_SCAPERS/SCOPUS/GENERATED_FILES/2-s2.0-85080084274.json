Epilepsy, a condition characterised by spontaneous recurrent seizures, is common in older adults (aged >65 years) and yet has received comparatively little attention in this age group. In this Review, we evaluate the underlying causes of epilepsy in older people, explore difficulties in establishing a diagnosis of epilepsy in this population, discuss appropriate antiseizure medications, and evaluate potential surgical treatment options. We consider cognitive, psychological, and psychosocial comorbidities and the effect that epilepsy might have on an older person's broader social or care network in high-income versus middle-income and low-income countries. We emphasise the need for clinical trials to be more inclusive of older people with epilepsy to help inform therapeutic decision making and discuss whether measures to improve vascular risk factors might be an important strategy to reduce the probability of developing epilepsy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Anticonvulsants", "Autoimmune Diseases of the Nervous System", "Brain Neoplasms", "Cerebrovascular Disorders", "Clinical Decision-Making", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Comorbidity", "Developed Countries", "Developing Countries", "Epilepsy", "Humans", "Incidence", "Mental Disorders", "Neurosurgical Procedures", "Prevalence", "Status Epilepticus", "Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85080084274", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"8615156400": {"Name": "Sen A.", "AuthorID": "8615156400", "AffiliationID": "60008323, 60172675, 60002634", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Epilepsy Research Group, National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "57209451065": {"Name": "Jette N.", "AuthorID": "57209451065", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Neurology and Population Health Sciences & Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}, "7201522757": {"Name": "Husain M.", "AuthorID": "7201522757", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Oxford"}, "57188659835": {"Name": "Sander J.W.", "AuthorID": "57188659835", "AffiliationID": "60027759", "AffiliationName": "Stichting Epilepsie Instellingen Nederland (SEIN)"}}}
