Alimentary Pharmacology & Therapeutics published by John Wiley & Sons LtdBackground: No prognostic tools are established for alcohol-related liver disease (ALD). Collagen proportionate area (CPA) measurement is a technique that quantifies fibrous tissue in liver biopsies using digital image analysis. Aim: To assess the predictive value of CPA on hepatic decompensation and liver-related mortality in ALD. Methods: In a multicentre cohort study, we included 386 patients with biopsy-verified ALD and with long-term follow-up. In the development cohort of 276 patients, we assessed the predictors of hepatic decompensation and liver-related death in standard and competing risk multivariable Cox regression analyses. The results were validated in an independent prospective cohort of 110 patients, where CPA was also correlated with liver stiffness measurement (LSM). Results: In the development cohort, 231 (84%) patients had early/compensated ALD (non-cirrhotic or compensated cirrhosis) and 45 (16%) had decompensated cirrhosis. In the validation cohort, all patients had early/compensated ALD. Independent predictors of liver-related mortality were higher CPA values (HR = 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.04) and advanced fibrosis (HR = 2.80, 95% CI 1.29-6.05) with similar results in standard and competing risk multivariable Cox regression analysis. In early/compensated ALD, CPA was the only independent predictor of hepatic decompensation and liver-related death (HR = 1.08, 95% CI 1.06-1.11). In the prospective cohort, we validated that CPA independently predicts hepatic decompensation in early/compensated ALD. The predictive power of CPA and LSM was equally strong. Conclusions: CPA predicts liver-related mortality in ALD and hepatic decompensation and/or liver-related death in early/compensated ALD. Traditional histological assessment may benefit from the addition of CPA to the evaluation of ALD.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092268138", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"55758938100": {"Name": "Israelsen M.", "AuthorID": "55758938100", "AffiliationID": "60011350, 60019160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Research, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Southern Denmark"}, "56518225700": {"Name": "Guerrero Misas M.", "AuthorID": "56518225700", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, Royal Free Hospital and UCL"}, "57219337481": {"Name": "Koutsoumourakis A.", "AuthorID": "57219337481", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, Royal Free Hospital and UCL"}, "57202032852": {"Name": "Buzzetti E.", "AuthorID": "57202032852", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, Royal Free Hospital and UCL"}, "57211147744": {"Name": "Prat L.I.", "AuthorID": "57211147744", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, Royal Free Hospital and UCL"}, "22958739600": {"Name": "Roccarina D.", "AuthorID": "22958739600", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, Royal Free Hospital and UCL"}, "7005412715": {"Name": "Pinzani M.", "AuthorID": "7005412715", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, Royal Free Hospital and UCL"}, "16023392700": {"Name": "Tsochatzis E.A.", "AuthorID": "16023392700", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, Royal Free Hospital and UCL"}, "55134983800": {"Name": "Thiele M.", "AuthorID": "55134983800", "AffiliationID": "60011350, 60019160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Research, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Southern Denmark"}, "55175686500": {"Name": "Rasmussen D.", "AuthorID": "55175686500", "AffiliationID": "60011350, 60019160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Research, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Southern Denmark"}, "14034289900": {"Name": "Krag A.", "AuthorID": "14034289900", "AffiliationID": "60011350, 60019160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Research, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Southern Denmark"}, "9738567200": {"Name": "Detlefsen S.", "AuthorID": "9738567200", "AffiliationID": "60015591", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Odense University Hospital"}, "55821620600": {"Name": "Huang Y.", "AuthorID": "55821620600", "AffiliationID": "60087991, 60025898, 60031806", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine and Pharmacology, University of Western Australia and Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital"}, "7006756025": {"Name": "Jeffrey G.", "AuthorID": "7006756025", "AffiliationID": "60087991, 60025898, 60031806", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine and Pharmacology, University of Western Australia and Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital"}, "57220873579": {"Name": "Hall A.", "AuthorID": "57220873579", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cellular Pathology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College of London"}, "54916621100": {"Name": "Luong T.V.", "AuthorID": "54916621100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cellular Pathology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College of London"}, "55357692500": {"Name": "Quaglia A.", "AuthorID": "55357692500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cellular Pathology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College of London"}, "57119851800": {"Name": "Covelli C.", "AuthorID": "57119851800", "AffiliationID": "60070410", "AffiliationName": "Pathology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza"}}}
