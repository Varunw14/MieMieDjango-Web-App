Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.Background: Typhoid fever remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in low- and middle-income settings. In the last 10 years, several reports have described the reemergence of typhoid fever in southern and eastern Africa, associated with multidrug-resistant H58 Salmonella Typhi. Here, we identify risk factors for pediatric typhoid fever in a large epidemic in Blantyre, Malawi. Methods: A case-control study was conducted between April 2015 and November 2016. Cases were recruited at a large teaching hospital, and controls were recruited from the community, matched by residential ward. Stepwise variable selection and likelihood ratio testing were used to select candidate risk factors for a final logistic regression model. Results: Use of river water for cooking and cleaning was highly associated with risk of typhoid fever (odds ratio [OR], 4.6 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.7-12.5]). Additional risk factors included protective effects of soap in the household (OR, 0.6 [95% CI,. 4-.98]) and >1 water source used in the previous 3 weeks (OR, 3.2 [95% CI, 1.6-6.2]). Attendance at school or other daycare was also identified as a risk factor (OR, 2.7 [95% CI, 1.4-5.3]) and was associated with the highest attributable risk (51.3%). Conclusions: These results highlight diverse risk factors for typhoid fever in Malawi, with implications for control in addition to the provision of safe drinking water. There is an urgent need to improve our understanding of transmission pathways of typhoid fever, both to develop tools for detecting S. Typhi in the environment and to inform water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["environment", "Salmonella Typhi", "sanitation", "WASH", "water"], "IndexKeywords": ["Africa, Eastern", "Case-Control Studies", "Child", "Humans", "Malawi", "Rivers", "Salmonella typhi", "Typhoid Fever", "Water"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077210335", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57204182579": {"Name": "Gauld J.S.", "AuthorID": "57204182579", "AffiliationID": "60118104, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Informatics, Computing, and Statistics, Lancaster University"}, "36761595400": {"Name": "Read J.M.", "AuthorID": "36761595400", "AffiliationID": "60118104, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Informatics, Computing, and Statistics, Lancaster University"}, "7006313409": {"Name": "Diggle P.J.", "AuthorID": "7006313409", "AffiliationID": "60118104, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Informatics, Computing, and Statistics, Lancaster University"}, "57210452773": {"Name": "Olgemoeller F.", "AuthorID": "57210452773", "AffiliationID": "60072678", "AffiliationName": "Malawi-Liverpool Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"}, "56593766400": {"Name": "Li C.", "AuthorID": "56593766400", "AffiliationID": "60029003", "AffiliationName": "Xi'An Jiaotong University Health Science Center"}, "36479968900": {"Name": "Feasey N.A.", "AuthorID": "36479968900", "AffiliationID": "60072678", "AffiliationName": "Malawi-Liverpool Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"}, "44661289000": {"Name": "Nkhata R.", "AuthorID": "44661289000", "AffiliationID": "60072678", "AffiliationName": "Malawi-Liverpool Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"}, "57216560748": {"Name": "Chirambo A.", "AuthorID": "57216560748", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool"}, "7402800616": {"Name": "Gordon M.A.", "AuthorID": "7402800616", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool"}, "23474335000": {"Name": "Morse T.", "AuthorID": "23474335000", "AffiliationID": "60072660", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Water, Sanitation, Health and Appropriate Technology Development, University of Malawi-Polytechnic"}, "7005251165": {"Name": "Heyderman R.S.", "AuthorID": "7005251165", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "7101730459": {"Name": "Kennedy N.", "AuthorID": "7101730459", "AffiliationID": "60014295, 60029738", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, Dentistry and Biomedical Sciences, Queen's University Belfast"}}}
