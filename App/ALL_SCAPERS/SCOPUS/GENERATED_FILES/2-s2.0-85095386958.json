However, the specific kill mechanism(s) are still debated, and how primary production subsequently recovered remains elusive. We used marine plankton microfossils and eco-evolutionary modeling to determine strategies for survival and recovery, finding that widespread phagotrophy (prey ingestion) was fundamental to plankton surviving the impact and also for the subsequent reestablishment of primary production. Ecological selectivity points to extreme postimpact light inhibition as the principal kill mechanism, with the marine food chain temporarily reset to a bacteria-dominated state. Subsequently, in a sunlit ocean inhabited by only rare survivor grazers but abundant small prey, it was mixotrophic nutrition (autotrophy and heterotrophy) and increasing cell sizes that enabled the eventual reestablishment of marine food webs some 2 million years later.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bolide impact", "Evolutionary models", "Heterotrophy", "Light inhibition", "Marine food web", "Marine planktons", "Post impacts", "Primary production"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095386958", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57219929330": {"Name": "Gibbs J.", "AuthorID": "57219929330", "AffiliationID": "60025225, 60010934", "AffiliationName": "Ocean and Earth Science, National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, University of Southampton"}, "55438794600": {"Name": "Ward B.A.", "AuthorID": "55438794600", "AffiliationID": "60025225, 60010934", "AffiliationName": "Ocean and Earth Science, National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, University of Southampton"}, "6701346236": {"Name": "Bown P.R.", "AuthorID": "6701346236", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "57205481335": {"Name": "Alvarez S.A.", "AuthorID": "57205481335", "AffiliationID": "60111693", "AffiliationName": "University of Gibraltar, Europa Point Campus, Gibraltar"}, "57211248326": {"Name": "Kim H.", "AuthorID": "57211248326", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "57192955441": {"Name": "Archontikis O.A.", "AuthorID": "57192955441", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "57190689611": {"Name": "Sauterey B.", "AuthorID": "57190689611", "AffiliationID": "60105781, 60000179, 60008134, 60000905, 60108665", "AffiliationName": "Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, PSL Research University, Institut de Biologie de l'Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure (IBENS), Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) Unit\u00e9 Mixte de Recherche (UMR) 8197, Institut National de la Sant\u00e9 et de la Recherche M\u00e9dicale (INSERM) U1024"}, "6701523871": {"Name": "Poulton A.J.", "AuthorID": "6701523871", "AffiliationID": "60019656, 60171663", "AffiliationName": "Lyell Centre for Earth and Marine Science and Technology, Heriot-Watt University"}, "57190004815": {"Name": "Wilson J.", "AuthorID": "57190004815", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Geographical Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "6602583456": {"Name": "Ridgwell A.", "AuthorID": "6602583456", "AffiliationID": "60029526", "AffiliationName": "Earth and Planetary Sciences, University of California at Riverside"}}}
