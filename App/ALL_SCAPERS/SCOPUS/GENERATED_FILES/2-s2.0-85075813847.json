Blocking the ensuing reconsolidation process is suggested as a therapeutic target for unwanted aversive memories. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is required for structural synapse remodeling involved in memory consolidation. Inhibiting MMP-9 with doxycycline is suggested to attenuate human threat conditioning. Here, we investigated whether MMP-9 inhibition also interferes with threat memory reconsolidation. Male and female human participants (N = 78) learned the association between two visual conditioned stimuli (CS +) and a 50% chance of an unconditioned nociceptive stimulus (US), and between CS - and the absence of US. On day 7, one CS + was reminded without reinforcement 3.5 h after ingesting either 200 mg of doxycycline or placebo. On day 14, retention of CS memory was assessed under extinction by fear-potentiated startle. Contrary to our expectations, we observed a greater CS +/CS - difference in participants who were reminded under doxycycline compared with placebo. Participants who were reminded under placebo showed extinction learning during the retention test, which was not observed in the doxycycline group. There was no difference between the reminded and the nonreminded CS + in either group. In contrast, during relearning after the retention test, the CS +/CS - difference was more pronounced in the placebo group than in the doxycycline group. To summarize, a single dose of doxycycline before threat memory reminder appeared to have no specific impact on reconsolidation, but to globally impair extinction learning, and threat relearning, beyond drug clearance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fear-potentiated startle", "Matrix metalloproteinase", "Psychophysiological modeling", "Reconsolidation", "Threat conditioning", "Trauma-related disorder"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Doxycycline", "Extinction, Psychological", "Fear", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Matrix Metalloproteinase 9", "Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors", "Memory", "Neuronal Plasticity", "Random Allocation", "Reflex, Startle", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075813847", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"9746516300": {"Name": "Bach D.R.", "AuthorID": "9746516300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60122566, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research, University College London"}, "57200543356": {"Name": "N\u00e4f M.", "AuthorID": "57200543356", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Experimental and Clinical Pharmacopsychology, Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, University of Zurich"}, "57212057883": {"Name": "Deutschmann M.", "AuthorID": "57212057883", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Computational Psychiatry Research, Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, University of Zurich"}, "54950947800": {"Name": "Tyagarajan S.K.", "AuthorID": "54950947800", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Zurich"}, "7003344504": {"Name": "Quednow B.B.", "AuthorID": "7003344504", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Experimental and Clinical Pharmacopsychology, Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, University of Zurich"}}}
