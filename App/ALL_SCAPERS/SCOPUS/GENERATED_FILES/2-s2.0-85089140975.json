The results of the systematic review showed support for the trans-diagnostic approach to eating disorders. There was no strong evidence to support the characterisation of AN as high in compulsivity (and low in impulsivity), nor to support the characterisation of BN as high in impulsivity (and low in compulsivity). There appeared to be mixed findings for both impulsivity and compulsivity across AN and BN. Results were highly variable due to the heterogeneous tasks used, and lack of replication across studies. There was no consensus amongst the included studies on the most appropriate task and/or outcome measures that should be used to study the constructs of impulsivity and compulsivity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Action cancellation", "Action inhibition", "Action restraint", "Eating disorders", "Interference control", "Risk taking", "Set-shifting"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089140975", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"56192217000": {"Name": "Howard M.", "AuthorID": "56192217000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational, and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "57193700903": {"Name": "Gregertsen E.C.", "AuthorID": "57193700903", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational, and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "56149013800": {"Name": "Hindocha C.", "AuthorID": "56149013800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational, and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "55747914900": {"Name": "Serpell L.", "AuthorID": "55747914900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational, and Health Psychology, University College London"}}}
