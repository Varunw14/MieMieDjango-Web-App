Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are valuable for displaying and analyzing spatial data, revealing spatial patterns that may otherwise go unnoticed. The ubiquity of web and mobile platforms, used to create and share geographic information has reified the value of GIS to a wider audience bringing new popularity to GIS. As a result, GIS and Geographic Information Science (GIScience) are becoming increasingly sought after in interdisciplinary research, which often addresses multifaceted, real-world problems. To understand the necessary level of GIS expertise for a specific interdisciplinary research project, we suggest that the team early on identify the role of GIS within the research. Is it simply the use of GIS as a Tool, employing a GIS Toolmaker for bespoke applications or a GIScientist for new forms of spatial analyses and guidance on social, ethical and spatial ambiguities? To allay future challenges and miscommunication in interdisciplinary research involving GIS, three case studies are presented and common themes related to challenges for the GIScientists are shared.", "AuthorKeywords": ["geographic information science", "Interdisciplinary research", "Science-technology-society", "spatial turn", "webgis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Future challenges", "Geographic information", "Geographic information science", "Interdisciplinary research", "Mobile platform", "Real-world problem", "Spatial analysis", "Spatial patterns"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084312506", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"36955512100": {"Name": "Ricker B.A.", "AuthorID": "36955512100", "AffiliationID": "60018815, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development, Utrecht University"}, "56404634600": {"Name": "Rickles P.R.", "AuthorID": "56404634600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental, and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "57189576764": {"Name": "Fagg G.A.", "AuthorID": "57189576764", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental, and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "6602429978": {"Name": "Haklay M.E.", "AuthorID": "6602429978", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}}}
