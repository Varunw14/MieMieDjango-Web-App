Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Society for Rheumatology. All rights reserved.Racial factors play a significant role in SSc. We evaluated differences in SSc presentations between white patients (WP), Asian patients (AP) and black patients (BP) and analysed the effects of geographical locations. Methods: SSc characteristics of patients from the EUSTAR cohort were cross-sectionally compared across racial groups using survival and multiple logistic regression analyses. Results: The study included 9162 WP, 341 AP and 181 BP. AP developed the first non-RP feature faster than WP but slower than BP. AP were less frequently anti-centromere (ACA; odds ratio (OR) = 0.4, P < 0.001) and more frequently anti-topoisomerase-I autoantibodies (ATA) positive (OR = 1.2, P = 0.068), while BP were less likely to be ACA and ATA positive than were WP [OR(ACA) = 0.3, P < 0.001; OR(ATA) = 0.5, P = 0.020]. AP had less often (OR = 0.7, P = 0.06) and BP more often (OR = 2.7, P < 0.001) diffuse skin involvement than had WP. AP and BP were more likely to have pulmonary hypertension [OR(AP) = 2.6, P < 0.001; OR(BP) = 2.7, P = 0.03 vs WP] and a reduced forced vital capacity [OR(AP) = 2.5, P < 0.001; OR(BP) = 2.4, P < 0.004] than were WP. AP more often had an impaired diffusing capacity of the lung than had BP and WP [OR(AP vs BP) = 1.9, P = 0.038; OR(AP vs WP) = 2.4, P < 0.001]. After RP onset, AP and BP had a higher hazard to die than had WP [hazard ratio (HR) (AP) = 1.6, P = 0.011; HR(BP) = 2.1, P < 0.001]. Conclusion: Compared with WP, and mostly independent of geographical location, AP have a faster and earlier disease onset with high prevalences of ATA, pulmonary hypertension and forced vital capacity impairment and higher mortality. BP had the fastest disease onset, a high prevalence of diffuse skin involvement and nominally the highest mortality.", "AuthorKeywords": ["organ manifestations", "races", "systemic sclerosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "African Continental Ancestry Group", "Aged", "Asian Continental Ancestry Group", "Autoantibodies", "DNA Topoisomerases, Type I", "European Continental Ancestry Group", "Female", "Humans", "Hypertension, Pulmonary", "Lung", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Scleroderma, Systemic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088708108", "SubjectAreas": [["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"56201755200": {"Name": "Jaeger V.K.", "AuthorID": "56201755200", "AffiliationID": "60028287", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, University Hospital Basel"}, "7003907112": {"Name": "Walker U.A.", "AuthorID": "7003907112", "AffiliationID": "60028287", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, University Hospital Basel"}, "7004118459": {"Name": "Tikly M.", "AuthorID": "7004118459", "AffiliationID": "60027219, 60016218", "AffiliationName": "Division of Rheumatology, Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital, University of the Witwatersrand"}, "55683664900": {"Name": "Xu D.", "AuthorID": "55683664900", "AffiliationID": "100468695", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, Peking Union Medical, College Hospital"}, "57215063207": {"Name": "Li M.", "AuthorID": "57215063207", "AffiliationID": "100468695", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, Peking Union Medical, College Hospital"}, "24173610000": {"Name": "Siegert E.", "AuthorID": "24173610000", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, University Hospital Charit\u00e9"}, "35377410100": {"Name": "Hachulla E.", "AuthorID": "35377410100", "AffiliationID": "60104665, 60107862, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "D\u00e9partement de M\u00e9decine Interne et Immunologie Clinique, Centre de R\u00e9f\u00e9rence des Maladies Syst\u00e9miques et, Auto-Immunes Rares du Nord et Nord-Ouest (CERAINO), Liric, Inserm, Univ.
