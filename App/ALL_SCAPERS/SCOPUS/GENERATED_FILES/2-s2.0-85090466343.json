Magnetic Resonance in Medicine published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of International Society for Magnetic Resonance in MedicinePurpose: A fundamental goal in the drive to understand and find better treatments for dementia is the identification of the factors that render the aging brain vulnerable to neurodegenerative disease. Recent evidence indicates the integrity of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) to be an important component of functional failure underlying age-related cognitive decline. Practical and sensitive measurement is necessary, therefore, to support diagnostic and therapeutic strategies targeted at maintaining BBB integrity in aging patients. Here, we investigated changes in BBB permeability to endogenous blood water in the aging brain. Methods: A multiple-echo-time arterial spin-labeling MRI technique, implemented on a 9.4T Bruker imaging system, was applied to 7- and 27-month-old mice to measure changes in water permeability across the BBB with aging. Results: We observed that BBB water permeability was 32% faster in aged mice. This occurred along with a 2.1-fold increase in mRNA expression of aquaporin-4 water channels and a 7.1-fold decrease in mRNA expression of \u03b1-syntrophin protein, which anchors aquaporin-4 to the BBB. Conclusion: Age-related changes to water permeability across the BBB can be captured using noninvasive noncontrast MRI techniques.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aging", "aquaporin-4", "arterial spin labeling", "blood\u2013brain barrier", "blood\u2013brain interface", "water permeability"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age-related changes", "Arterial spin labeling", "Cognitive decline", "Functional failure", "mRNA expression", "Sensitive measurement", "Therapeutic strategy", "Water permeability"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090466343", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57203525812": {"Name": "Ohene Y.", "AuthorID": "57203525812", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "55382681000": {"Name": "Harrison I.F.", "AuthorID": "55382681000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "57203535214": {"Name": "Evans P.G.", "AuthorID": "57203535214", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "7004107686": {"Name": "Lythgoe M.F.", "AuthorID": "7004107686", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "35220662900": {"Name": "Wells J.A.", "AuthorID": "35220662900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "55485914900": {"Name": "Thomas D.L.", "AuthorID": "55485914900", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
