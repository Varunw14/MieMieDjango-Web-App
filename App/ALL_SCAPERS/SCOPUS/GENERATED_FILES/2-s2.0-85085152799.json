Patients are usually screened four months after starting fingolimod for fingolimod-associated macular oedema (FAME). Large registration trials with stringent eligibility criteria have reported a FAME incidence of 0 \u2013 2.08%. Objectives: To determine the real-world incidence of FAME in a London population, and to describe the clinical characteristics and management of confirmed cases. Methods: All patients started on fingolimod from September 2012 to September 2018 were referred for ophthalmology clinical examination and macular spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) at four months after starting treatment. Exclusion criteria were failure to attend or non-gradable OCT images. Results: Of 228 patients, two had FAME at initial screening, giving an incidence of 0.88% (95% confidence interval 0.10\u20133.10). Another case emerged subsequently, at 637 days, resulting in a final incidence of 1.32% (95% confidence interval 0.30\u20133.80). Fingolimod was discontinued in two cases. FAME resolved in all cases within two to 10 months, with no persistent visual loss or symptoms. Conclusions: The real-world FAME incidence is consistent with fingolimod registration studies. FAME may have a delayed onset and may be better detected with newer OCT devices.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fingolimod", "Macular oedema", "Multiple sclerosis", "Optical coherence tomography"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085152799", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56100374000": {"Name": "Goh L.Y.", "AuthorID": "56100374000", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, King's College Hospital NHS Trust"}, "57221028157": {"Name": "Harvey J.P.", "AuthorID": "57221028157", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, King's College Hospital NHS Trust"}, "36056795700": {"Name": "Kirthi V.", "AuthorID": "36056795700", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, School of Life Science and Medicine, King's College London"}, "7401595709": {"Name": "Jackson T.L.", "AuthorID": "7401595709", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, School of Life Science and Medicine, King's College London"}, "57204026828": {"Name": "Silber E.", "AuthorID": "57204026828", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, King's College Hospital NHS Trust"}}}
