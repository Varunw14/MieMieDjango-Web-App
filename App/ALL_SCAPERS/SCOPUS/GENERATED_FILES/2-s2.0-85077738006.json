Quantizers are typically designed to obtain an accurate digital representation of the input signal, operating independently of the system task, and are commonly implemented using serial scalar analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). In this work, we study hardware-limited task-based quantization, where a system utilizing a serial scalar ADC is designed to provide a suitable representation in order to allow the recovery of a parameter vector underlying the input signal. We propose hardware-limited task-based quantization systems for a fixed and finite quantization resolution, and characterize their achievable distortion. We then apply the analysis to the practical setups of channel estimation and eigen-spectrum recovery from quantized measurements. Our results illustrate that properly designed hardware-limited systems can approach the optimal performance achievable with vector quantizers, and that by taking the underlying task into account, the quantization error can be made negligible with a relatively small number of bits.", "AuthorKeywords": ["analog-to-digital conversion", "Quantization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Analog to digital converters", "Digital representations", "Digital signal processing systems", "Quantization", "Quantization errors", "Quantization resolution", "Quantized measurements", "Spectrum recoveries"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077738006", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56049577600": {"Name": "Shlezinger N.", "AuthorID": "56049577600", "AffiliationID": "60017563", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Weizmann Institute of Science"}, "35562426100": {"Name": "Eldar Y.", "AuthorID": "35562426100", "AffiliationID": "60017563", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Weizmann Institute of Science"}, "57210526627": {"Name": "Rodrigues M.", "AuthorID": "57210526627", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
