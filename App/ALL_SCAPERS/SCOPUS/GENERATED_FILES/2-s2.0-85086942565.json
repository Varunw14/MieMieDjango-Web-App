The same systems are also of direct interest in modeling selective photo-detachment experiments in cold ion traps where the He atoms function as the chief buffer gas at the low trap temperatures. This study employs accurate, ab initio calculations of the interaction potential energy surfaces for these anions, treated as rigid rotors, and the He atom to obtain a wide range of state-changing quantum cross sections and rates at temperatures up to about 100 K. The results are analyzed and compared for the two systems to show differences and similarities between their rates of state-changing dynamics.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Ab initio calculations", "Changing dynamics", "Chemical networks", "Computational comparisons", "Interaction potentials", "Interstellar environment", "Quantum calculation", "Rotational dynamics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086942565", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"14829990900": {"Name": "Franz J.", "AuthorID": "14829990900", "AffiliationID": "60027012", "AffiliationName": "Department of Theoretical Physics and Quantum Informatics, Faculty of Applied Physics and Mathematics, Gda\u0144sk University of Technology"}, "55633703600": {"Name": "Mant B.P.", "AuthorID": "55633703600", "AffiliationID": "60009999", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Ion Physics and Applied Physics, University of Innsbruck"}, "7006645985": {"Name": "Wester R.", "AuthorID": "7006645985", "AffiliationID": "60009999", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Ion Physics and Applied Physics, University of Innsbruck"}, "7102308377": {"Name": "Gianturco F.A.", "AuthorID": "7102308377", "AffiliationID": "60009999", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Ion Physics and Applied Physics, University of Innsbruck"}, "6602434366": {"Name": "Gonz\u00e1lez-S\u00e1nchez L.", "AuthorID": "6602434366", "AffiliationID": "60025028", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Qu\u00edmica F\u00edsica, University of Salamanca"}}}
