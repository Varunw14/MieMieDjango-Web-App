Chatterjee and Leonie Hannan 2015.The use of museum collections as a path to learning for university students is fast becoming a new pedagogy for higher education. Despite a strong tradition of using lectures as a way of delivering the curriculum, the positive benefits of \u2018active\u2019 and \u2018experiential learning\u2019 are being recognised in universities at both a strategic level and in daily teaching practice. As museum artefacts, specimens and art works are used to evoke, provoke, and challenge students\u2019 engagement with their subject, so transformational learning can take place. This unique book presents the first comprehensive exploration of \u2018object-based learning\u2019 as a pedagogy for higher education in a broad context. An international group of authors offer a spectrum of approaches at work in higher education today. They explore contemporary principles and practice of object-based learning in higher education, demonstrating the value of using collections in this context and considering the relationship between academic discipline and object-based learning as a teaching strategy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086962588", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"14063145400": {"Name": "Chatterjee H.J.", "AuthorID": "14063145400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, Division of Biosciences, School of Life and Medical Sciences and Department of Public and Cultural Engagement, University College"}, "55356167000": {"Name": "Hannan L.", "AuthorID": "55356167000", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Collaborative Research in the Humanities, Queen\u2019s University"}}}
