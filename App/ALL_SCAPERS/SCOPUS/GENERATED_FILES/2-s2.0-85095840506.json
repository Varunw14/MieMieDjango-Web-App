Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Radar measurements of gravitational mass-movements like snow avalanches have become increasingly important for scientific flow observations, real-time detection and monitoring. Independence of visibility is a main advantage for rapid and reliable detection of those events, and achievable high-resolution imaging proves invaluable for scientific measurements of the complete flow evolution. Existing radar systems are made for either detection with low-resolution or they are large devices and permanently installed at test-sites. We present mGEODAR, a mobile FMCW (frequency modulated continuous wave) radar system for high-resolution measurements and low-resolution gravitational mass-movement detection and monitoring purposes due to a versatile frequency generation scheme. We optimize the performance of different frequency settings with loop cable measurements and show the freespace range sensitivity with data of a car as moving point source. About 15 dB signal-to-noise ratio is achieved for the cable test and about 5 dB or 10 dB for the car in detection and research mode, respectively. By combining continuous recording in the low resolution detection mode with real-time triggering of the high resolution research mode, we expect that mGEODAR enables autonomous measurement campaigns for infrastructure safety and mass-movement research purposes in rapid response to changing weather and snow conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Flow dynamics", "FMCW Radar", "Geophysical mass-movements", "Movement detection", "Natural hazards"], "IndexKeywords": ["Different frequency", "Frequency generation", "Frequency-modulated continuous waves", "High-resolution imaging", "High-resolution measurements", "Measurement campaign", "Moving point source", "Real-time detection"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095840506", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56594443400": {"Name": "K\u00f6hler A.", "AuthorID": "56594443400", "AffiliationID": "60018789", "AffiliationName": "WSL-Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research SLF"}, "57219872210": {"Name": "Felbermayr S.", "AuthorID": "57219872210", "AffiliationID": "60004100", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechatronic, Management Centre Innsbruck (MCI)"}, "8987589300": {"Name": "Fischer J.T.", "AuthorID": "8987589300", "AffiliationID": "60026496", "AffiliationName": "Department of Natural Hazards, Austrian Research Centre for Forests (BFW)"}, "57198996462": {"Name": "Lok L.B.", "AuthorID": "57198996462", "AffiliationID": "60117770, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering, Lancaster University"}, "35220363000": {"Name": "Peters N.", "AuthorID": "35220363000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "35087329300": {"Name": "Brennan P.V.", "AuthorID": "35087329300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
