Based on other countries\u2019 experience, uptake may initially be lower in boys than girls. We assessed HPV vaccine attitudes and decision-making in parents of boys and girls, to explore sex differences and inform public health messages. Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional population-based survey using home-based interviews in spring 2019. Participants were adults in England and Wales, with a child in school years 5\u20137 (aged 9\u201312 and eligible for HPV vaccination within 3 years). Measures included awareness of HPV and the vaccine, demographic factors, previous vaccine refusal and (after exposure to brief information) whether participants would allow their child to have the HPV vaccine (decided to vaccinate; decided not to vaccinate; undecided). We also assessed vaccine attitudes. Data were weighted to adjust for non-response. Multinomial logistic regression was used to explore predictors of deciding to (or not to) vaccinate compared with being undecided. Results: Among 1049 parents (weighted n = 1156), 55% were aware of HPV and the girls\u2019 vaccination programme, but only 23% had heard of plans to vaccinate boys. After information exposure, 62% said they would vaccinate their child, 10% would not, and 28% were undecided. Parents of girls were more willing to vaccinate than parents of boys (adjusted odds ratio: 1.80 (1.32\u20132.45)). Positive attitudes and HPV/vaccine awareness were significantly independently associated with deciding to vaccinate. Previous vaccine refusal for a child was the strongest predictor of not wanting the HPV vaccine. Conclusions: Our findings suggest a need for public health campaigns to raise awareness of plans to extend HPV vaccination to boys. Reassuringly only 10% of all parents were unwilling to vaccinate and our data suggest further information, including about safety and efficacy, may be important in supporting undecided parents to make the decision to vaccinate.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Attitudes", "Boys", "HPV vaccine", "Precaution adoption process model"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076201304", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Veterinary (all)", "VETE", "3400"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57191898211": {"Name": "Waller J.", "AuthorID": "57191898211", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Communication & Screening Group, Department of Behavioural Science and Health, UCL"}, "6508131110": {"Name": "Marlow L.", "AuthorID": "6508131110", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Communication & Screening Group, Department of Behavioural Science and Health, UCL"}, "16300728600": {"Name": "Forster A.", "AuthorID": "16300728600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Communication & Screening Group, Department of Behavioural Science and Health, UCL"}, "57208719314": {"Name": "Ryan M.", "AuthorID": "57208719314", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Communication & Screening Group, Department of Behavioural Science and Health, UCL"}, "57212215069": {"Name": "Richards R.", "AuthorID": "57212215069", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Communication & Screening Group, Department of Behavioural Science and Health, UCL"}, "7004859466": {"Name": "Bedford H.", "AuthorID": "7004859466", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice Research and Teaching Department, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}}}
