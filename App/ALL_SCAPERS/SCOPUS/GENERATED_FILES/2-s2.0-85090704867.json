HIV infection in adults depletes circulating ILCs, but the impact on children infected from birth remains unknown. We study vertically HIV-infected children from birth to adulthood and find severe and persistent depletion of all circulating ILCs that, unlike CD4+ T cells, are not restored by long-term antiretroviral therapy unless initiated at birth. Remaining ILCs upregulate genes associated with cellular activation and metabolic perturbation. Unlike HIV-infected adults, ILCs are also profoundly depleted in tonsils of vertically infected children. Transcriptional profiling of remaining ILCs reveals ongoing cell-type-specific activity despite antiretroviral therapy. Collectively, these data suggest an important and ongoing role for ILCs in lymphoid tissue of HIV-infected children from birth, where persistent depletion and sustained transcriptional activity are likely to have long-term immune consequences that merit further investigation.\u00a9 2020 The Author(s)ILCs are dysregulated during HIV-1 infection in adults, but their fate in children is unknown. Singh et al. demonstrate that circulating and tonsil-resident ILCs are depleted in children infected with HIV-1 since birth. Transcriptionally, ILCs exhibit cell-type- and compartment-specific activity in HIV-1 infected children compared to healthy controls.", "AuthorKeywords": ["HIV", "ILCs", "NK cells", "pediatric infection", "tonsil", "vertical transmission"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090704867", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"57209245458": {"Name": "Singh A.", "AuthorID": "57209245458", "AffiliationID": "60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute (AHRI)"}, "54790224600": {"Name": "Roider J.", "AuthorID": "54790224600", "AffiliationID": "60000291, 60028717", "AffiliationName": "Medizinische Klinik IV, Department of Infectious Diseases, Ludwig-Maximilians-University"}, "57210840984": {"Name": "Asowata O.E.", "AuthorID": "57210840984", "AffiliationID": "60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute (AHRI)"}, "57203842461": {"Name": "Ngoepe A.", "AuthorID": "57203842461", "AffiliationID": "60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute (AHRI)"}, "53878362600": {"Name": "Ramsuran D.", "AuthorID": "53878362600", "AffiliationID": "60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute (AHRI)"}, "57199861881": {"Name": "Fardoos R.", "AuthorID": "57199861881", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology and Microbiology, University of Copenhagen"}, "57206208443": {"Name": "Ardain A.", "AuthorID": "57206208443", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "School of Laboratory Medicine and Medical Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "55235090000": {"Name": "Karim F.", "AuthorID": "55235090000", "AffiliationID": "60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute (AHRI)"}, "6507164421": {"Name": "Ndung'u T.", "AuthorID": "6507164421", "AffiliationID": "60022344", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology"}, "7003741802": {"Name": "Goulder P.", "AuthorID": "7003741802", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "HIV Pathogenesis Programme, The Doris Duke Medical Research Institute, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "7102795676": {"Name": "Leslie A.", "AuthorID": "7102795676", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "School of Laboratory Medicine and Medical Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "16230399500": {"Name": "Kl\u00f8verpris H.N.", "AuthorID": "16230399500", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "School of Laboratory Medicine and Medical Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "54787737600": {"Name": "Kazer S.W.", "AuthorID": "54787737600", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Ragon Institute of MGH, Harvard, and MIT"}, "57218905335": {"Name": "Krista K.C.", "AuthorID": "57218905335", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Ragon Institute of MGH, Harvard, and MIT"}, "9536603100": {"Name": "Shalek A.K.", "AuthorID": "9536603100", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Ragon Institute of MGH, Harvard, and MIT"}, "57203155376": {"Name": "Millar J.", "AuthorID": "57203155376", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "HIV Pathogenesis Programme, The Doris Duke Medical Research Institute, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "55848587500": {"Name": "Muenchhoff M.", "AuthorID": "55848587500", "AffiliationID": "125105690", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Infection Research (DZIF)"}, "57089819400": {"Name": "Kuhn W.", "AuthorID": "57089819400", "AffiliationID": "60010499, 60078844", "AffiliationName": "ENT Department General Justice Gizenga Mpanza Regional Hospital (Stanger Hospital), University of KwaZulu-Natal"}}}
