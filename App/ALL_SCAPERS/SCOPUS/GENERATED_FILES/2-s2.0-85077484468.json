Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.RNA:5-methylcytosine (m5C) methyltransferases are currently the focus of intense research following a series of high-profile reports documenting their physiological links to several diseases. However, no methods exist which permit the specific analysis of RNA:m5C methyltransferases in cells. Herein, we described how a combination of biophysical studies led us to identify distinct duplex-remodelling effects of m5C on RNA and DNA duplexes. Specifically, m5C induces a C3\u2032-endo to C2\u2032-endo sugar-pucker switch in CpG RNA duplex but triggers a B-to-Z transformation in CpG DNA duplex. Inspired by these different 'structural signatures', we developed a m5C-sensitive probe which fluoresces spontaneously in response to m5C-induced sugar-pucker switch, hence useful for sensing RNA:m5C methyltransferase activity. Through the use of this probe, we achieved real-time imaging and flow cytometry analysis of NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase 2 (NSUN2) activity in HeLa cells. We further applied the probe to the cell-based screening of NSUN2 inhibitors. The developed strategy could also be adapted for the detection of DNA:m5C methyltransferases. This was demonstrated by the development of DNA m5C-probe which permits the screening of DNA methyltransferase 3A inhibitors. To our knowledge, this study represents not only the first examples of m5C-responsive probes, but also a new strategy for discriminating RNA and DNA m5C methyltransferase activity in cells.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["DNA", "DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases", "Drug Design", "Enzyme Inhibitors", "Flow Cytometry", "Fluorescent Dyes", "HeLa Cells", "Humans", "Kinetics", "Methyltransferases", "Molecular Imaging", "Molecular Probes", "Nucleic Acid Conformation", "RNA", "Single-Cell Analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077484468", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"55470243000": {"Name": "Yang T.", "AuthorID": "55470243000", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, National University of Singapore"}, "56450142300": {"Name": "Low J.J.A.", "AuthorID": "56450142300", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, National University of Singapore"}, "8845545300": {"Name": "Woon E.C.Y.", "AuthorID": "8845545300", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, National University of Singapore"}}}
