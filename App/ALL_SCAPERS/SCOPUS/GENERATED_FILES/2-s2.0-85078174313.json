Methods: Of twenty-eight consecutive DMEK cases, five (18%) required re-bubbling. A 20-gauge side port blade was used to make a paracentesis in the inferior temporal quadrant. A 30-gauge cannula mounted on a 3 ml syringe was employed to inject air using the paracentesis as a valve allowing better control over intraocular pressure and percentage anterior chamber air fill. Results: Graft re-attachment was achieved in all cases. One case required two re-bubbling procedures. There were no cases of pupil block glaucoma or other complications. Conclusion: Slit-lamp re-bubbling is a practical and safe alternative to taking patients back to the operating room. Using a new paracentesis for valve action control over air injection with a blunt cannula adds better control and may help to reduce complications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DMEK", "Paracentesis", "Re-bubbling", "Slit lamp", "Valve"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078174313", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"57191439856": {"Name": "Vasquez-Perez A.", "AuthorID": "57191439856", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7102506160": {"Name": "Allan B.", "AuthorID": "7102506160", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "55340829200": {"Name": "Fernandez-Vega Cueto L.", "AuthorID": "55340829200", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "57094732600": {"Name": "Aiello F.", "AuthorID": "57094732600", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}}}
