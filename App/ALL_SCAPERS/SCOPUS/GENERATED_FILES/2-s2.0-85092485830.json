Our unit utilizes standardized torsional springs with a central helix for spring-assisted surgery. This design allows a high degree of accuracy and reproducibility of the force vectors and force distance curves. In this manuscript, we expand on the biomechanical testing and properties of these springs. Standardization of design has enabled us to study the springs on bench and in vivo and a comprehensive repository of calvarial remodeling and spring dynamics has been acquired and analyzed.Finite element modeling is a technique utilized to predict the outcomes of spring-assisted surgery. We have found this to be a useful tool, in planning our surgical strategy and improving outcomes. This technique has also contributed significantly to the process of informed consent preoperatively. In this article, we expand on our spring design and dynamics as well as the finite element modeling used to predict and improve outcomes.In our unit, this practice has led to a significant improvement in patient outcomes and parental satisfaction and we hope to make our techniques available to a wider audience.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biomechanical Phenomena", "Craniosynostoses", "Finite Element Analysis", "Humans", "Retrospective Studies", "Surgical Equipment", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092485830", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"]], "AuthorData": {"55401970300": {"Name": "Jeelani N.U.O.", "AuthorID": "55401970300", "AffiliationID": "125208428", "AffiliationName": "Craniofacial Research Unit"}, "23396002400": {"Name": "Borghi A.", "AuthorID": "23396002400", "AffiliationID": "125208428", "AffiliationName": "Craniofacial Research Unit"}, "55539055900": {"Name": "Florez N.R.", "AuthorID": "55539055900", "AffiliationID": "125208428", "AffiliationName": "Craniofacial Research Unit"}, "35100053600": {"Name": "Bozkurt S.", "AuthorID": "35100053600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Cardiovascular Science"}, "7003742514": {"Name": "Dunaway D.", "AuthorID": "7003742514", "AffiliationID": "125208428", "AffiliationName": "Craniofacial Research Unit"}, "13410386200": {"Name": "Schievano S.", "AuthorID": "13410386200", "AffiliationID": "125208428", "AffiliationName": "Craniofacial Research Unit"}}}
