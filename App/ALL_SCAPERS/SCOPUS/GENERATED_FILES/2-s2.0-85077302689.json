Unplanned critical care admission poses a potential risk to patients and pressure on services. Existing guidelines base admission criteria on predicted risk of 30-day mortality; however, this may not provide the best predictor of which patients would benefit from this service, and how unplanned admission might be avoided. A systematic review of MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, the Cochrane database and the grey literature identified 44 studies assessing risk factors for unplanned critical care admission in adult populations undergoing non-cardiac, non-thoracic and non-neurological surgery. Comparative, quantitative analysis of the admission criteria was not feasible due to heterogeneity in study design. Age, anaemia, ASA physical status, body mass index, comorbidity burden, emergency surgery, high-risk surgery, male sex, obstructive sleep apnoea, increased blood loss and operative duration were all independent risk factors for unplanned critical care admission. Age, body mass index, comorbidity extent and emergency surgery were the most common independent risk factors identified in the USA, UK, Asia and Australia. These risk factors could be used in the development of a risk tool or decision tree for determining which patients might benefit from planned critical care admission. Future work should involve testing the sensitivity and specificity of these measures, either alone or in combination, to guide planned critical care admission, reduce patient deterioration and unplanned admissions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["critical care", "high-risk", "major surgery", "risk factors", "unplanned admission"], "IndexKeywords": ["Critical Care", "Humans", "Patient Readmission", "Risk Factors", "Surgical Procedures, Operative"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077302689", "SubjectAreas": [["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"54966704200": {"Name": "Onwochei D.N.", "AuthorID": "54966704200", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, Guy's & St. Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust"}, "12798737700": {"Name": "Fabes J.", "AuthorID": "12798737700", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57191839341": {"Name": "Walker D.", "AuthorID": "57191839341", "AffiliationID": "60176023, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Anaesthesia and Peri-operative Medicine, UCL Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "55430370000": {"Name": "Kumar G.", "AuthorID": "55430370000", "AffiliationID": "60176023, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Anaesthesia and Peri-operative Medicine, UCL Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "15046929200": {"Name": "Moonesinghe S.R.", "AuthorID": "15046929200", "AffiliationID": "60176023, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Anaesthesia and Peri-operative Medicine, UCL Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}}}
