Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Society for Rheumatology.SLE is a severe autoimmune disease characterized by autoreactive B cells and IC formation, which causes systemic inflammation. B cell-targeted therapy could be a promising treatment strategy in SLE patients; nevertheless, randomized clinical trials have not always been successful. However, some groups have demonstrated beneficial effects in severe SLE patients with off-label rituximab (RTX) with belimumab (BLM), or bortezomib (BTZ), which targeted different B cells subsets. This study assembled sera from SLE cohorts treated with RTX+BLM (n = 15), BTZ (n = 11) and RTX (n = 16) to get an in-depth insight into the immunological effects of these therapies on autoantibodies and IC formation. Methods: Autoantibodies relevant for IC formation and the avidity of anti-dsDNA were determined by ELISA. IC-mediated inflammation was studied by complement levels and ex vivo serum-induced neutrophil extracellular trap formation. Results: Reductions in autoantibodies were observed after all approaches, but the spectrum differed depending upon the treatment. Specifically, only RTX+BLM significantly decreased anti-C1q. Achieving seronegativity of \u22651 autoantibody, specifically anti-C1q, was associated with lower disease activity. In all SLE patients, the majority of anti-dsDNA autoantibodies had low avidity. RTX+BLM significantly reduced low-, medium- and high-avidity anti-dsDNA, while RTX and BTZ only significantly reduced medium avidity. IC-mediated inflammation, measured by C3 levels and neutrophil extracellular trap formation, improved after RTX+BLM and RTX but less after BTZ. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the impact of different B cell-targeted strategies on autoantibodies and IC formation and their potential clinical relevance in SLE.", "AuthorKeywords": ["autoantibodies", "B cell-targeted therapies", "immune-complex formation", "neutrophil extracellular traps", "SLE"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized", "Antigen-Antibody Complex", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological", "Autoantibodies", "B-Lymphocyte Subsets", "B-Lymphocytes", "Bortezomib", "Complement System Proteins", "Drug Therapy, Combination", "Extracellular Traps", "Female", "Humans", "Immunity, Humoral", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Research Design", "Rituximab"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089731512", "SubjectAreas": [["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57201381567": {"Name": "Van Dam L.S.", "AuthorID": "57201381567", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC)"}, "57219205963": {"Name": "Osmani Z.", "AuthorID": "57219205963", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC)"}, "7003578106": {"Name": "Kamerling S.W.A.", "AuthorID": "7003578106", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC)"}, "56590525600": {"Name": "Kraaij T.", "AuthorID": "56590525600", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC)"}, "55897548800": {"Name": "Rabelink T.J.", "AuthorID": "55897548800", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC)"}, "7004678500": {"Name": "Van Kooten C.", "AuthorID": "7004678500", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC)"}, "8715477500": {"Name": "Teng Y.K.O.", "AuthorID": "8715477500", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC)"}, "7203072531": {"Name": "Bakker J.A.", "AuthorID": "7203072531", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine"}, "36828427600": {"Name": "Scherer H.U.", "AuthorID": "36828427600", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, Leiden University Medical Centre"}, "7006018669": {"Name": "Voll R.E.", "AuthorID": "7006018669", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg"}, "25957613200": {"Name": "Alexander T.", "AuthorID": "25957613200", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Charit\u00e9-University Medicine Berlin"}, "57201108555": {"Name": "Isenberg D.A.", "AuthorID": "57201108555", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology, Division of Medicine, University College London"}}}
