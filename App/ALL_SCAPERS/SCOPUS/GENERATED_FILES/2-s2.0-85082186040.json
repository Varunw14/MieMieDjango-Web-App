Drawing on astronaut testimony, experiences of microgravity environments, laboratory experiments and art practice this paper argues that gravity, or rather its absence, offers a unique vantage point through which to consider the human relationship to emotion, cognition, and the curation of social relations via experiences of the body in different gravitational environments. The analysis draws attention to the contextual, embodied and contingent moments of social relations through using a holistic materialist position with theories of affect and work on the anthropology of the body. An anthropology of gravity recognises the ethno-physical conditions of space-living by showing that microgravity environments disturb the habitual affective landscapes of human interaction. It suggests that body, emotion, social relations and environment can be better understood when they are contextualised by the underlying forces that operate subtly throughout them; forces that are more fully understood once they are no longer present.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Affect", "Anthropology", "Gravity", "Movement", "Outerspace", "The body"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082186040", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"]], "AuthorData": {"55830212200": {"Name": "Parkhurst A.", "AuthorID": "55830212200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lecturer in Biosocial and Medical Anthropology, Department of Anthropology, University College London (UCL)"}, "56166778700": {"Name": "Jeevendrampillai D.", "AuthorID": "56166778700", "AffiliationID": "60013141", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Anthropology, NTNU Norwegian University of Science and Technology"}}}
