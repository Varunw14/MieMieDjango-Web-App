Pediatric Obesity published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of World Obesity Federation.Background: Attending childcare is related to greater childhood obesity risk, but there are few long-term follow-up studies. We aimed to examine the associations of childcare type, age at start, and intensity with body mass index body mass index (BMI) trajectories from ages 10 to 42 years. Methods: The sample comprised 8234 individuals in the 1970 British Cohort Study, who had data on childcare attendance (no, yes), type (formal, informal), age at start (4-5, 3-3.99, 0-2.99 years old), and intensity (1, 2, 3, 4-5 days/week) reported at age 5 years and 32 563 BMI observations. Multilevel linear spline models were used to estimate the association of each exposure with the sample-average BMI trajectory, with covariate adjustment. A combined age at start and intensity exposure was also examined. Results: Attending vs not attending and the type of childcare (none vs formal/informal) were not strongly related to BMI trajectories. Among participants who attended childcare 1 to 2 days a week, those who started when 3 to 3.99 years old had a 0.197 (\u22120.004, 0.399) kg/m2 higher BMI at age 10 years than those who started when 4 to 5 years old, and those who started when 0 to 2.99 years old had a 0.289 (0.049, 0.529) kg/m2 higher BMI. A similar dose-response pattern for intensity was observed when holding age at start constant. By age 42 years, individuals who started childcare at age 0 to 2.99 years and attended 3 to 5 days/week had a 1.356 kg/m2 (0.637, 2.075) higher BMI than individuals who started at age 4 to 5 years and attended 1 to 2 days/week. Conclusions: Children who start childcare earlier and/or attend more frequently may have greater long-term obesity risk.", "AuthorKeywords": ["birth cohort study", "body mass index", "childcare", "obesity", "trajectories"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age Factors", "Body Mass Index", "Child", "Child Care", "Child, Preschool", "Cohort Studies", "England", "Ethnic Groups", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Obesity", "Pediatric Obesity", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085144995", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"56374325100": {"Name": "Costa S.", "AuthorID": "56374325100", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University"}, "35431196500": {"Name": "Johnson W.", "AuthorID": "35431196500", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University"}, "55790281500": {"Name": "Bann D.", "AuthorID": "55790281500", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Longitudinal Studies, University College London (UCL) Institute of Education"}, "16243910000": {"Name": "Benjamin-Neelon S.E.", "AuthorID": "16243910000", "AffiliationID": "60006183, 60005248", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health, Behavior and Society, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University"}, "7404784266": {"Name": "Adams J.", "AuthorID": "7404784266", "AffiliationID": "60025649, 60009969, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "UKCRC Centre for Diet and Activity Research (CEDAR), MRC Epidemiology Unit, School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge"}}}
