Papers published in Educational Management, Administration and Leadership and Management in Education over the last few years confirm this view. This article argues that although there is a significant overlap between them, leadership, management and administration are different from each other and this should be recognised when talking and writing about school organisation and development, with not all three being subsumed under the banner of \u2018leadership\u2019. In particular, the article argues for the re-establishment of management as a major element in the development and training of heads and prospective heads of schools and colleges.", "AuthorKeywords": ["administration", "headship", "leadership", "management", "school organisation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092199524", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"]], "AuthorData": {"57219314564": {"Name": "Craig I.", "AuthorID": "57219314564", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}}}
