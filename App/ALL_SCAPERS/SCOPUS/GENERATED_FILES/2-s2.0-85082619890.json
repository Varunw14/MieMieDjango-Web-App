Clinical & Translational Immunology published by John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd on behalf of Australian and New Zealand Society for Immunology Inc.There is growing recognition that mucus and mucin biology have a considerable impact on respiratory health, and subsequent global morbidity and mortality. Mucins play a critical role in chronic lung disease, not only by providing a physical barrier and clearing pathogens, but also in immune homeostasis. The aim of this review is to familiarise the reader with the role of mucins in both lung health and disease, with particular focus on function in immunity, infection and inflammation. We will also discuss their receptors, termed glycan-binding proteins, and how they provide an attractive prospect for therapeutic intervention.", "AuthorKeywords": ["glycan-binding protein", "glycosylation", "immunology", "mucin", "pulmonary"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082619890", "SubjectAreas": [["Nursing (all)", "NURS", "2900"], ["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"57216127431": {"Name": "Denneny E.", "AuthorID": "57216127431", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Leukocyte Trafficking Laboratory, Centre for Inflammation and Tissue Repair, UCL Respiratory, Rayne Institute, University College London"}, "57201311165": {"Name": "Sahota J.", "AuthorID": "57201311165", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Leukocyte Trafficking Laboratory, Centre for Inflammation and Tissue Repair, UCL Respiratory, Rayne Institute, University College London"}, "7403426976": {"Name": "Porter J.", "AuthorID": "7403426976", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Leukocyte Trafficking Laboratory, Centre for Inflammation and Tissue Repair, UCL Respiratory, Rayne Institute, University College London"}, "36156969900": {"Name": "Beatson R.", "AuthorID": "36156969900", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Breast Cancer Biology Group, Division of Cancer Studies, King's College London, Guy's Hospital"}, "7003872134": {"Name": "Burchell J.", "AuthorID": "7003872134", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Breast Cancer Biology Group, Division of Cancer Studies, King's College London, Guy's Hospital"}, "7102566694": {"Name": "Thornton D.", "AuthorID": "7102566694", "AffiliationID": "60105831, 60111801, 60172345", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell-Matrix Research, School of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, Manchester Academic Health Sciences Centre, University of Manchester"}}}
