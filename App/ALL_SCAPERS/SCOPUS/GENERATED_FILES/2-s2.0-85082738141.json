We introduce a phenomenological parametrisation of the simplified one-generation seesaw model with one active and two sterile neutrino states in terms of experimentally measurable quantities, such as active-sterile neutrino mixing angles, CP phases, masses and mass splittings. This simple parametrisation enables us to analytically derive a spectrum of possible scenarios between the canonical seesaw with purely Majorana heavy neutrinos and inverse seesaw with pseudo-Dirac ones. We then go on to constrain the simplified parameters of this model from various experiments at the energy, intensity and cosmic frontiers. We emphasise that the constraints from lepton number violating processes strongly depend on the mass splitting between the two sterile states and the relative CP phase between them. This is particularly relevant for neutrinoless double beta decay, which is weakened for small mass splitting and opposite CP parities between the sterile states. On the other hand, neutrinoless double beta decay is especially sensitive for Majorana sterile neutrinos with masses around 0.1 \u2212 10 GeV.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Beyond Standard Model", "Neutrino Physics"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082738141", "SubjectAreas": [["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"]], "AuthorData": {"57209750414": {"Name": "Bolton P.D.", "AuthorID": "57209750414", "AffiliationID": "60005455, 60025576", "AffiliationName": "Wright Laboratory, Department of Physics, Yale University"}, "8903178300": {"Name": "Deppisch F.F.", "AuthorID": "8903178300", "AffiliationID": "60025205, 60003156", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Hochenergiephysik, \u00d6sterreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften"}, "57195551051": {"Name": "Dev P.S.B.", "AuthorID": "57195551051", "AffiliationID": "60074756, 60010261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and McDonnell Center for the Space Sciences, Washington University"}}}
