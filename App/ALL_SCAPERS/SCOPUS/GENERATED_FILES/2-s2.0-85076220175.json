We tested the role of different mechanical loads on extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling gene expression and the morphology of tendon fibroblasts in collagen hydrogels, designed to mimic native tissue. Hydrogels were subjected to precise static or uniaxial loading patterns of known magnitudes and sampled to analyse gene expression of known mechano-responsive ECM-associated genes (Collagen I, Collagen III, Tenomodulin, and TGF-\u03b2). Tendon fibroblast cytomechanics was studied under load by using a tension culture force monitor, with immunofluorescence and immunohistological staining used to examine cell morphology. Tendon fibroblasts subjected to cyclic load showed that endogenous matrix tension was maintained, with significant concomitant upregulation of ECM remodelling genes, Collagen I, Collagen III, Tenomodulin, and TGF-\u03b2 when compared with static load and control samples. These data indicate that tendon fibroblasts acutely adapt to the mechanical forces placed upon them, transmitting forces across the ECM without losing mechanical dynamism. This model demonstrates cell-material (ECM) interaction and remodelling in preclinical a platform, which can be used as a screening tool to understand tendon regeneration.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cytomechanics", "extracellular matrix", "tendon", "tendon fibroblast", "tendon healing", "tissue remodelling"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076220175", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"56209158300": {"Name": "Sawadkar P.", "AuthorID": "56209158300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and interventional Science, UCL Stanmore campus"}, "44861723400": {"Name": "Player D.", "AuthorID": "44861723400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and interventional Science, UCL Stanmore campus"}, "56188117800": {"Name": "Mudera V.", "AuthorID": "56188117800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and interventional Science, UCL Stanmore campus"}, "6602787947": {"Name": "Bozec L.", "AuthorID": "6602787947", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}}}
