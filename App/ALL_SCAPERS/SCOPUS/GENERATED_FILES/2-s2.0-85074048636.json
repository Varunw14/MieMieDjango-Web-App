Whether it is effective after this age is unknown. We assessed whether height and weight SDS changed after tube feeding was started in children with CKD above 2 years of age. Methods: Retrospective study of pre-transplant, pre-pubertal children (< 11 years) with CKD stages 2\u20135 started on nasogastric tube or gastrostomy feeds for the first time after age 2 years. Children were identified by searching dietetic records and the renal database. Children on growth hormone were excluded. Height, weight, and BMI were documented 1 year prior to and at the start of tube feeds, and after 1 and 2 years. Data collection ceased at transplantation. Results: Fifty children (25 male) were included. The median (range) age at start of tube feeds was 5.6 (2.1\u201310.9) years. Sixteen children were dialysed (1 haemodialysis, 15 peritoneal dialysis); 34 predialysis patients had a median (range) eGFR of 22 (6\u201388) ml/min/1.73 m2. Overall height SDS (Ht SDS) improved from \u2212 2.39 to \u2212 2.27 at 1 year and \u2212 2.18 after 2 years (p = 0.02). BMI SDS improved from \u2212 0.72 to 0.23 after 1 year and was 0.09 after 2 years of enteral feeding (p < 0.0001). Height SDS improved more in children aged 2\u20136 years (\u2212 2.13 to \u2212 1.68, p = 0.03) and in children not on dialysis (\u2212 2.33 to \u2212 1.99, p = 0.002). Conclusions: Enteral tube feeding commenced after 2 years of age in prepubertal children with CKD improves height and weight SDS, with stability of BMI during the second year. Younger children and those not on dialysis had the greatest benefit.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chronic kidney disease", "Enteral feeding", "Gastrostomy", "Growth", "Paediatrics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Body Height", "Body Mass Index", "Child", "Child Development", "Child, Preschool", "Enteral Nutrition", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Peritoneal Dialysis", "Renal Dialysis", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic", "Retrospective Studies", "Time-to-Treatment", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074048636", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"57208565754": {"Name": "Marlais M.", "AuthorID": "57208565754", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "56086171700": {"Name": "Stojanovic J.", "AuthorID": "56086171700", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "14519125100": {"Name": "Cleghorn S.", "AuthorID": "14519125100", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "16146771300": {"Name": "Rees L.", "AuthorID": "16146771300", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "23469780100": {"Name": "Jones H.", "AuthorID": "23469780100", "AffiliationID": "60107269", "AffiliationName": "Evelina London Children\u2019s Hospital"}}}
