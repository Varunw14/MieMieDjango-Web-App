Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Mac Keith PressVariants in the gene SCN1A are a common genetic cause for a wide range of epilepsy phenotypes ranging from febrile seizures to Dravet syndrome. Focal onset seizures and structural lesions can be present in these patients and the question arises whether epilepsy surgery should be considered. We report eight patients (mean age 13y 11mo [SD 8y 1mo], range 3\u201326y; four females, four males) with SCN1A variants, who underwent epilepsy surgery. Outcomes were variable and seemed to be directly related to the patient\u2019s anatomo-electroclinical epilepsy phenotype. Patients with Dravet syndrome had unfavourable outcomes, whilst patients with focal epilepsy, proven to arise from a single structural lesion, had good results. We conclude that the value of epilepsy surgery in patients with an SCN1A variant rests on two issues: understanding whether the variant is pathogenic and the patient\u2019s anatomo-electroclinical phenotype. Careful evaluation of epilepsy phenotype integrated with understanding the significance of genetic variants is essential in determining a patient\u2019s suitability for epilepsy surgery. Patients with focal onset epilepsy may benefit from epilepsy surgery, whereas those with Dravet syndrome do not. What this paper adds: Patients should not automatically be excluded from epilepsy surgery evaluation if they carry an SCN1A variant. Patients with focal epilepsy may benefit from epilepsy surgery; those with Dravet syndrome do not.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Epilepsies, Myoclonic", "Epilepsies, Partial", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "NAV1.1 Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel", "Outcome Assessment, Health Care", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086438670", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57212510133": {"Name": "Vezyroglou A.", "AuthorID": "57212510133", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "56347087500": {"Name": "Cross J.H.", "AuthorID": "56347087500", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "6602286208": {"Name": "Varadkar S.", "AuthorID": "6602286208", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "7004934157": {"Name": "Bast T.", "AuthorID": "7004934157", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Medical Faculty of the University of Freiburg"}, "6701850511": {"Name": "Strobl K.", "AuthorID": "6701850511", "AffiliationID": "100351304", "AffiliationName": "Kork Epilepsy Center"}, "7201435231": {"Name": "Hirsch E.", "AuthorID": "7201435231", "AffiliationID": "60103368, 60010247", "AffiliationName": "Medical and Surgical Epilepsy Unit, Hautepierre Hospital, University of Strasbourg"}, "7402410288": {"Name": "Harvey A.S.", "AuthorID": "7402410288", "AffiliationID": "60026489", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, The Royal Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "7006332397": {"Name": "Scheffer I.E.", "AuthorID": "7006332397", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60026489, 60005087, 60110201, 60009102", "AffiliationName": "Florey Institute and Murdoch Children\u2019s Research Institute, Austin Health and Royal Children\u2019s Hospital, University of Melbourne"}, "7005111176": {"Name": "Sisodiya S.M.", "AuthorID": "7005111176", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "57210075693": {"Name": "Devlin A.", "AuthorID": "57210075693", "AffiliationID": "112928806", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology, Great North Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "8622598700": {"Name": "Hedrich U.B.S.", "AuthorID": "8622598700", "AffiliationID": "60084331, 60017246", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Epileptology, Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research, University of Tuebingen"}, "57203078114": {"Name": "Lerche H.", "AuthorID": "57203078114", "AffiliationID": "60084331, 60017246", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Epileptology, Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research, University of Tuebingen"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
