Because children appear to be less severely affected than adults, their imaging appearances have not been extensively reported. Objective: To systematically review available literature regarding imaging findings in paediatric cases of COVID-19. Materials and methods: We searched four databases (Medline, Embase, Cochrane, Google Scholar) for articles describing imaging findings in children with COVID-19. We included all modalities, age <18 years, and foreign language articles, using descriptive statistics to identify patterns and locations of imaging findings, and their association with outcomes. Results: Twenty-two articles were included, reporting chest imaging findings in 431 children, of whom 421 (97.7%) underwent CT. Criteria for imaging were lacking. At diagnosis, 143/421 (34.0%) had a normal CT. Abnormalities were more common in the lower lobes and were predominantly unilateral. The most common imaging pattern was ground-glass opacification (159/255, 62.4%). None of the studies described lymphadenopathy, while pleural effusions were rare (three cases). Improvement at follow-up CT imaging (3\u201315 days later) was seen in 29/100 (29%), remained normal in 25/100 (25%) and progressed in 9/100 (9%). Conclusion: CT chest findings in children with COVID-19 are frequently normal or mild. Lower lobes are predominantly affected by patchy ground-glass opacification. Appearances at follow-up remain normal or improve in the majority of children. Chest CT imaging adds little to the further management of the patient and should be reserved for severe cases or for identifying alternative diagnoses.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adolescents", "Children", "Computed tomography", "Coronavirus", "COVID-19", "Imaging", "Radiology", "Systematic review"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Betacoronavirus", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Coronavirus Infections", "Databases, Factual", "Humans", "Infant", "Lung", "Pandemics", "Pneumonia, Viral", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086578942", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"55545709400": {"Name": "Shelmerdine S.C.", "AuthorID": "55545709400", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital NIHR Biomedical Research Centre"}, "23994045100": {"Name": "Lovrenski J.", "AuthorID": "23994045100", "AffiliationID": "112653686", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Children and Adolescents Health Care of Vojvodina"}, "53063176800": {"Name": "Caro-Dom\u00ednguez P.", "AuthorID": "53063176800", "AffiliationID": "60033267", "AffiliationName": "Unidad de Radiolog\u00eda Pedi\u00e1trica, Servicio de Radiodiagn\u00f3stico, Hospital Universitario Virgen del Roc\u00edo"}, "55242395700": {"Name": "Toso S.", "AuthorID": "55242395700", "AffiliationID": "122209109", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diagnostics, Pediatric Radiology, Geneva Children\u2019s Hospitals"}, "56482992200": {"Name": "Alexopoulou E.", "AuthorID": "56482992200", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57217167972": {"Name": "Almanza J.", "AuthorID": "57217167972", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "23481036600": {"Name": "Calder A.D.", "AuthorID": "23481036600", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "55344559800": {"Name": "Ciet P.", "AuthorID": "55344559800", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57215028217": {"Name": "Damasio B.", "AuthorID": "57215028217", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "55609249000": {"Name": "Desoky S.M.", "AuthorID": "55609249000", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "6602255617": {"Name": "Gomez-Pastrana D.", "AuthorID": "6602255617", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "6701781494": {"Name": "Goo H.W.", "AuthorID": "6701781494", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "25629613100": {"Name": "Gorkem S.B.", "AuthorID": "25629613100", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7102856182": {"Name": "Hirsch F.W.", "AuthorID": "7102856182", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "6701705137": {"Name": "Kellenberger C.", "AuthorID": "6701705137", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57216877902": {"Name": "Mahani M.G.", "AuthorID": "57216877902", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "35795737000": {"Name": "Navallas M.", "AuthorID": "35795737000", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7102511623": {"Name": "Owens C.M.", "AuthorID": "7102511623", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "6602073955": {"Name": "Raissaki M.", "AuthorID": "6602073955", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "55555343000": {"Name": "Riaza L.", "AuthorID": "55555343000", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7003453510": {"Name": "van Rijn R.R.", "AuthorID": "7003453510", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "38461819100": {"Name": "van Schuppen J.", "AuthorID": "38461819100", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "53867270200": {"Name": "Secinaro A.", "AuthorID": "53867270200", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7006406607": {"Name": "Toma P.", "AuthorID": "7006406607", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57220306555": {"Name": "Ugas Charcape C.S.", "AuthorID": "57220306555", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
