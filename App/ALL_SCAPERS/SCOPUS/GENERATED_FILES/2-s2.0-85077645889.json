Bla1 is a class A beta-lactamase whereas Bla2 is a Metallo beta-lactamase. In the current study, we have attempted in-detailed characterization of Bla1 beta-lactamase by taking interdisciplinary approaches. Our study includes structure and sequence comparison of this enzyme with other members of the class, to know the conservation pattern that includes active site residues, secondary structure, conserved fold, evolutionary relationships, etc. Dynamic characterizations of the enzyme, unfolding kinetics were determined with the help of Molecular dynamics simulation. Detailed enzyme stability and catalytic activity towards various physical (Temperature and pH), and chemical parameters (Urea, GnHCl) were performed. Together, our study helps to develop a proper understanding of this beta-lactamase by characterizing its biochemical, biophysical, dynamic, kinetic and thermodynamic properties. This would help contribute towards a better understanding of beta-lactamase based AMR emergence.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antimicrobial resistance", "Biochemical studies", "Biophysical characterization", "Catalytic divergence", "Minimum inhibitory concentration", "Molecular docking", "Molecular dynamics simulation", "Spectrophotometry techniques"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Bacillus anthracis", "beta-Lactamases", "Humans", "Kinetics", "Microbial Sensitivity Tests", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Thermodynamics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077645889", "SubjectAreas": [["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"]], "AuthorData": {"57202078739": {"Name": "Bhattacharya S.", "AuthorID": "57202078739", "AffiliationID": "60031818", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee"}, "57200569168": {"Name": "Junghare V.", "AuthorID": "57200569168", "AffiliationID": "60031818", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee"}, "57213174613": {"Name": "Pandey N.K.", "AuthorID": "57213174613", "AffiliationID": "60031818", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee"}, "15837197000": {"Name": "Hazra S.", "AuthorID": "15837197000", "AffiliationID": "60031818", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Nanotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee"}, "9941456000": {"Name": "Ghosh D.", "AuthorID": "9941456000", "AffiliationID": "60022334", "AffiliationName": "Biotechnology Conversion Area, Bio Fuels Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Petroleum"}, "14067825400": {"Name": "Patra H.", "AuthorID": "14067825400", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Cambridge"}}}
