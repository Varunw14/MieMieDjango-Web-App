We consider an autoencoder based on the recently proposed sliding window bidirectional recurrent neural network (SBRNN) design to realize the transceiver for optical IMDD communication. We show that its performance can be improved by introducing a weighted sequence estimation scheme at the receiver. Moreover, we perform bit-to-symbol mapping optimization to reduce the bit-error rate (BER) of the system. Furthermore, we carry out a detailed comparison with classical schemes based on pulse-amplitude modulation and maximum likelihood sequence detection (MLSD). Our investigation shows that for a reference 42 Gb/s transmission, the SBRNN autoencoder achieves a BER performance comparable to MLSD, when both systems account for the same amount of memory. In contrast to MLSD, the SBRNN performance is achieved without incurring a computational complexity exponentially growing with the processed memory.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bidirectional recurrent neural networks", "Bit-to-symbol mapping", "Classical schemes", "Dispersive channels", "Maximum-likelihood sequence detection", "Nonlinear channel", "Optical intensity modulation", "Weighted sequences"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077796850", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"]], "AuthorData": {"57194377945": {"Name": "Karanov B.", "AuthorID": "57194377945", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, University College London"}, "57110068500": {"Name": "Lavery D.", "AuthorID": "57110068500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, University College London"}, "7005053644": {"Name": "Bayvel P.", "AuthorID": "7005053644", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, University College London"}, "56114715000": {"Name": "Liga G.", "AuthorID": "56114715000", "AffiliationID": "60032882", "AffiliationName": "Eindhoven University of Technology, Signal Processing Systems Group"}, "30867529700": {"Name": "Aref V.", "AuthorID": "30867529700", "AffiliationID": "60021378", "AffiliationName": "Nokia Bell Labs"}, "24315127300": {"Name": "Schmalen L.", "AuthorID": "24315127300", "AffiliationID": "60102538", "AffiliationName": "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Communications Engineering Lab"}}}
