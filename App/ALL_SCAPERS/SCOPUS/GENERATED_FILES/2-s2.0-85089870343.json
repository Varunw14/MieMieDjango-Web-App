Somatic evolution drives cancer progression and treatment resistance, fuelled not only by genetic and epigenetic mutation but also by selection from interactions between tumour cells, normal cells and physical micro-environment. Ecological habitats influence evolutionary dynamics, but the impact on tempo of evolution is less clear. Methods: We explored this complex dialogue with a combined clinical\u2013theoretical approach by simulating a proliferative hierarchy under heterogeneous oxygen availability with an agent-based model. Predictions were compared against histology samples taken from glioblastoma patients, stained to elucidate areas of necrosis and TP53 expression heterogeneity. Results: Results indicate that cell division in hypoxic environments is effectively upregulated, with low-oxygen niches providing avenues for tumour cells to spread. Analysis of human data indicates that cell division is not decreased under hypoxia, consistent with our results. Conclusions: Our results suggest that hypoxia could be a crucible that effectively warps evolutionary velocity, making key mutations more likely. Thus, key tumour ecological niches such as hypoxic regions may alter the evolutionary tempo, driving mutations fuelling tumour heterogeneity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089870343", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"36543768900": {"Name": "Grimes D.R.", "AuthorID": "36543768900", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK/MRC Oxford Institute for Radiation Oncology, Gray Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "57220668111": {"Name": "Jansen M.", "AuthorID": "57220668111", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Endoscopy and Pathology, University College London Hospital"}, "57218631957": {"Name": "Macauley R.J.", "AuthorID": "57218631957", "AffiliationID": "60004803", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, H.
