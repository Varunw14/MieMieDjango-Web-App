Re-use permitted under CC BY. Published by BMJ.To examine the association between age at period cessation and trajectories of anthropometry, blood pressure, lipids and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) from midlife to age 69 years. Methods We used data from the UK Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development to examine the association between age at period cessation and trajectories of systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) from 36 to 69 years and trajectories of triglyceride, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and HbA1c from 53 to 69 years. Results We found no evidence that age at period cessation was associated with trajectories of log triglyceride, LDL-C and HDL-C from 53 to 69 years and trajectories of SBP or DBP from 36 to 69 years, regardless of whether period cessation occurred naturally or due to hysterectomy. While we found some evidence of associations of age at period cessation with log BMI, log WC and log HbA1c, patterns were not consistent and differences were small at age 69 years, with confidence intervals that spanned the null value. Conclusion How and when women experience period cessation is unlikely to adversely affect conventional cardiovascular risk factors across mid and later life. Women and clinicians concerned about the impact of type and timing of period cessation on conventional cardiovascular intermediates from midlife should be reassured that the impact over the long term is small.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cardiac risk factors and prevention", "epidemiology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Aged", "Blood Pressure", "Body Mass Index", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Female", "Glycated Hemoglobin A", "Humans", "Lipids", "Menopause", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Waist Circumference"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85080899332", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"56153764000": {"Name": "O'Keeffe L.M.", "AuthorID": "56153764000", "AffiliationID": "60025160", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Health, University College Cork"}, "8329745200": {"Name": "Kuh D.", "AuthorID": "8329745200", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60172455", "AffiliationName": "MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, University of Bristol"}, "55770838500": {"Name": "Fraser A.", "AuthorID": "55770838500", "AffiliationID": "60171764", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Science, Bristol Medical School"}, "14630195700": {"Name": "Howe L.D.", "AuthorID": "14630195700", "AffiliationID": "60171764", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Science, Bristol Medical School"}, "57204025615": {"Name": "Hardy R.", "AuthorID": "57204025615", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "CLOSER, UCL Institute of Education"}, "57206515095": {"Name": "Lawlor D.", "AuthorID": "57206515095", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL"}}}
