In our recently published study \u201cTemporal evolution of Myeloperoxidase and Galectin 3 during 1 year after acute coronary syndrome admission\u201d [1] in the American Heart Journal, we demonstrated that repeatedly measuring MPO and Galectin-3 does not aid to differentiate between patients with and without adverse cardiac events during 1-year follow-up. In this Data-In-Brief article, we present further details on data collections and data analysis. In addition, a detailed description of baseline characteristics and the distribution of blood sampling moments is provided. The BIOMArCS dataset contains clinical information and follow-up data on all enrolled 844 patients. These patients underwent a median of 17 (25th \u221275th percentile 12\u201320) repeated blood samples in the first year after the index ACS. Blood samples were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C within a median of 82 (25th-75th percentile 58\u2013117) minutes after withdrawal. We collected whole blood, citrate plasma, EDTA plasma, serum and DNA. The dataset used for the analysis in the accompanying research paper has been made available online. We welcome collaborations for further use of our data, whether or not in combination with other biobanks.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acute coronary syndrome", "Biomarkers", "Repeated blood sampling"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074503287", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"7102815542": {"Name": "Boersma E.", "AuthorID": "7102815542", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Thoraxcenter, Department of Cardiology"}, "57200413457": {"Name": "Vroegindewey M.", "AuthorID": "57200413457", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Thoraxcenter, Department of Cardiology"}, "56513845800": {"Name": "van den Berg V.", "AuthorID": "56513845800", "AffiliationID": "120497242", "AffiliationName": "Northwest Clinics, Department of Cardiology"}, "24172653000": {"Name": "Oemrawsingh R.", "AuthorID": "24172653000", "AffiliationID": "60070185", "AffiliationName": "Albert Schweitzer Hospital"}, "6602755087": {"Name": "Akkerhuis K.", "AuthorID": "6602755087", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Thoraxcenter, Department of Cardiology"}, "25946404200": {"Name": "Umans V.", "AuthorID": "25946404200", "AffiliationID": "120497242", "AffiliationName": "Northwest Clinics, Department of Cardiology"}, "57202567488": {"Name": "Asselbergs F.", "AuthorID": "57202567488", "AffiliationID": "60032724, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "University Medical Centre Utrecht, Division Heart & Lungs, Department of Cardiology, University of Utrecht"}, "6602378288": {"Name": "van der Harst P.", "AuthorID": "6602378288", "AffiliationID": "60006027", "AffiliationName": "University Medical Centre Groningen"}, "9234318900": {"Name": "Kietselaer B.", "AuthorID": "9234318900", "AffiliationID": "121362544", "AffiliationName": "Zuyderland Hospital"}, "6602754385": {"Name": "Lenderink T.", "AuthorID": "6602754385", "AffiliationID": "121362544", "AffiliationName": "Zuyderland Hospital"}, "6507286036": {"Name": "Oude Ophuis A.", "AuthorID": "6507286036", "AffiliationID": "107898206", "AffiliationName": "Working Group on Cardiovascular Research Netherlands"}, "7005751745": {"Name": "de Winter R.", "AuthorID": "7005751745", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Academic Medical Center"}}}
