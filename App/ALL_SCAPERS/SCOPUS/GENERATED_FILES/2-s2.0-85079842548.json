Re-use permitted under CC BY. Published by BMJ.Background Silver-Russell syndrome is an imprinting disorder that restricts growth, resulting in short adult stature that may be ameliorated by treatment. Approximately 50% of patients have loss of methylation of the imprinting control region (H19/IGF2:IG-DMR) on 11p15.5 and 5%-10% have maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7. Most published research focuses on the childhood phenotype. Our aim was to describe the phenotypic characteristics of older patients with SRS. Methods A retrospective cohort of 33 individuals with a confirmed molecular diagnosis of SRS aged 13 years or above were carefully phenotyped. Results The median age of the cohort was 29.6 years; 60.6% had a height SD score (SDS) \u2264-2 SDS despite 70% having received growth hormone treatment. Relative macrocephaly, feeding difficulties and a facial appearance typical of children with SRS were no longer discriminatory diagnostic features. In those aged \u226518 years, impaired glucose tolerance in 25%, hypertension in 33% and hypercholesterolaemia in 52% were noted. While 9/33 accessed special education support, university degrees were completed in 40.0% (>21 years). There was no significant correlation between quality of life and height SDS. 9/25 were parents and none of the 17 offsprings had SRS. Conclusion Historical treatment regimens for SRS were not sufficient for normal adult growth and further research to optimise treatment is justified. Clinical childhood diagnostic scoring systems are not applicable to patients presenting in adulthood and SRS diagnosis requires molecular confirmation. Metabolic ill-health warrants further investigation but SRS is compatible with a normal quality of life including normal fertility in many cases.", "AuthorKeywords": ["imprinting", "short stature", "Silver Russell syndrome", "uniparental disomy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079842548", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"57205109209": {"Name": "Lokulo-Sodipe O.", "AuthorID": "57205109209", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Endocrinology, University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundations Trust"}, "57207894459": {"Name": "Byrne C.D.", "AuthorID": "57207894459", "AffiliationID": "60000703, 60175924", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Southampton Biomedical Research Centre, University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7402243794": {"Name": "Mackay D.J.G.", "AuthorID": "7402243794", "AffiliationID": "60002284", "AffiliationName": "Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "26767740200": {"Name": "Davies J.H.", "AuthorID": "26767740200", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Endocrinology, University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"}, "12789387300": {"Name": "Karen Temple I.", "AuthorID": "12789387300", "AffiliationID": "60002967, 60000703", "AffiliationName": "Wessex Clinical Genetics Service, University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57202781965": {"Name": "Ballard L.", "AuthorID": "57202781965", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Sciences, University of Southampton Faculty of Medicine"}, "57202773400": {"Name": "Child J.", "AuthorID": "57202773400", "AffiliationID": "125159471", "AffiliationName": "Child Growth Foundation, Sutton Coldfield"}, "22998230100": {"Name": "Inskip H.M.", "AuthorID": "22998230100", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60023615", "AffiliationName": "MRC Epidemiology Unit, University of Southampton Faculty of Medicine"}, "55111372900": {"Name": "Ishida M.", "AuthorID": "55111372900", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7403283500": {"Name": "Moore G.E.", "AuthorID": "7403283500", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "6701763099": {"Name": "Wakeling E.L.", "AuthorID": "6701763099", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004545498": {"Name": "Fenwick A.", "AuthorID": "7004545498", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Ethics and Law at Southampton (CELS), Faculty of Medicine University of Southampton"}}}
