KGaA, WeinheimPhotoionisation in DNA, i. e. the process of photoinduced electron removal from the chromophoric species \u2013 the nucleobases \u2013 leading to their cationic form, has been scarcely studied despite being considered to be responsible for significant damaging instances in our genetic material. In this contribution we theoretically characterise the electronic ground and excited state decay pathways of cationic DNA nucleobase cytosine+ and its epigenetic derivative 5-methyl-cytosine+, including the effects of dynamic electron correlation on energies and geometries of minima and conical intersections. We do this by comparing the results of XMS-CASPT2 calculations with CASSCF estimates and we find some significant differences between the results of these two methods. In particular, including dynamic electron correlation is found to significantly reduce the barrier to access the (Formula presented.) conical intersection. We find notable similarities in both cytosine and 5-methyl-cytosine cations, and accessible conical intersections in the vicinity of the Franck-Condon region are found. This points towards an ultrafast depopulation of their electronic excited states. Moreover, the shape of the ground state potential energy surface strongly directs the decaying excited state population towards the cationic ground state minimum on ultrafast timescales, preventing photo-fragmentation and thus explaining their photostability. To better compare our calculations with the available experimental data we compute the UV (ground and excited state) and IR absorptions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["computational photochemistry", "DNA", "nucleobases", "photoionisation", "photostability", "radiationless decay"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082805050", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"]], "AuthorData": {"55295883500": {"Name": "Segarra-Mart\u00ed J.", "AuthorID": "55295883500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Molecular Sciences Research Hub, Imperial College London"}, "57209547250": {"Name": "Tran T.", "AuthorID": "57209547250", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Molecular Sciences Research Hub, Imperial College London"}, "7003882175": {"Name": "Bearpark M.J.", "AuthorID": "7003882175", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Molecular Sciences Research Hub, Imperial College London"}}}
