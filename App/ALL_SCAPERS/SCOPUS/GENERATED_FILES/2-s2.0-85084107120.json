The application of imaging biomarkers specifically for the in vivo investigation of neurodegenerative disorders has increased substantially over the past decades and continues to provide further benefits both to the diagnosis and understanding of these diseases. This review forms part of a series of articles which stem from the University College London/University of Gothenburg course \"Biomarkers in neurodegenerative diseases\". In this review, we focus on neuroimaging, specifically positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), giving an overview of the current established practices clinically and in research as well as new techniques being developed. We will also discuss the use of machine learning (ML) techniques within these fields to provide additional insights to early diagnosis and multimodal analysis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "dementia", "Machine learning", "MRI", "Neurodegenerative diseases", "Neuroimaging", "PET"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084107120", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"57216626483": {"Name": "Young P.N.E.", "AuthorID": "57216626483", "AffiliationID": "60046006, 60016437, 60031699", "AffiliationName": "Wallenberg Centre for Molecular and Translational Medicine, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, University of Gothenburg, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "57216627218": {"Name": "Srikrishna M.", "AuthorID": "57216627218", "AffiliationID": "60046006, 60016437, 60031699", "AffiliationName": "Wallenberg Centre for Molecular and Translational Medicine, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, University of Gothenburg, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "35070295800": {"Name": "Sch\u00f6ll M.", "AuthorID": "35070295800", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Physiology, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "57204582659": {"Name": "Estarellas M.", "AuthorID": "57204582659", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC), Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "57212149456": {"Name": "Coomans E.", "AuthorID": "57212149456", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC"}, "57213217287": {"Name": "Beaumont H.", "AuthorID": "57213217287", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience and Aphasia Research Unit, Division of Neuroscience and Experimental Psychology, University of Manchester"}, "56425646600": {"Name": "Maass A.", "AuthorID": "56425646600", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}, "36840399500": {"Name": "Betts M.J.", "AuthorID": "36840399500", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neurology and Dementia Research, Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg"}, "57193333379": {"Name": "Venkataraman A.V.", "AuthorID": "57193333379", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "United Kingdom Dementia Research Institute, Imperial College London"}, "57216626962": {"Name": "Lissaman R.", "AuthorID": "57216626962", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre (CUBRIC), School of Psychology"}, "57216627403": {"Name": "Jim\u00e9nez D.", "AuthorID": "57216627403", "AffiliationID": "60012464, 60002946", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurological Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Chile"}, "57205566889": {"Name": "O'Connor A.", "AuthorID": "57205566889", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7201444328": {"Name": "Fox N.C.", "AuthorID": "7201444328", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "55799312800": {"Name": "Paterson R.W.", "AuthorID": "55799312800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "55522241500": {"Name": "McGlinchey E.", "AuthorID": "55522241500", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Trinity College Dublin, University of Dublin"}, "56525318400": {"Name": "Berron D.", "AuthorID": "56525318400", "AffiliationID": "60118587, 60029170", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Memory Research Unit, Department of Clinical Sciences Malm\u00f6, Lund University"}, "26666254700": {"Name": "Pereira J.B.", "AuthorID": "26666254700", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Geriatrics, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet"}, "7006830290": {"Name": "Jagust W.", "AuthorID": "7006830290", "AffiliationID": "60007174", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"}, "23007332900": {"Name": "Carter S.F.", "AuthorID": "23007332900", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60111801", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Molecular Imaging Centre, Division of Neuroscience and Experimental Psychology, MAHSC, University of Manchester"}}}
