Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) could represent an especially vulnerable population because of the high mortality rates reported for respiratory infections. However, the number of COVID-19 cases reported among PAH and CTEPH patients is surprisingly low. Furthermore, the clinical picture that has been described in these patients is far from the severity that experts would expect. Endothelial dysfunction is a common feature between patients with PAH/CTEPH and COVID-19, leading to ventilation/perfusion mismatch, vasoconstriction, thrombosis and inflammation. In this picture, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 plays an essential role, being directly involved in the pathophysiology of both clinical entities. Some of these common characteristics could explain the good adaptation of PAH and CTEPH patients to COVID-19, who could also have obtained a benefit from the disease's specific treatments (anticoagulant and pulmonary vasodilators), probably due to its protective effect on the endothelium. Additionally, these common features could also lead to PAH/CTEPH as a potential sequelae of COVID-19. Throughout this comprehensive review, we describe the similarities and differences between both conditions and the possible pathophysiological and therapeutic-based mechanisms leading to the low incidence and severity of COVID-19 reported in PAH/CTEPH patients to date. Nevertheless, international registries should look carefully into this population for better understanding and management.", "AuthorKeywords": ["COVID-19", "Endothelial dysfunction", "Pulmonary circulation", "Pulmonary hypertension"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090250282", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"]], "AuthorData": {"57204759373": {"Name": "Nuche J.", "AuthorID": "57204759373", "AffiliationID": "60027282", "AffiliationName": "Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Complutense de Madrid"}, "6507662844": {"Name": "Guarch C.J.L.", "AuthorID": "6507662844", "AffiliationID": "60027282", "AffiliationName": "Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Complutense de Madrid"}, "56575648300": {"Name": "Ynsaurriaga F.A.", "AuthorID": "56575648300", "AffiliationID": "60027282", "AffiliationName": "Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Complutense de Madrid"}, "57210732293": {"Name": "Delgado J.F.", "AuthorID": "57210732293", "AffiliationID": "60027282", "AffiliationName": "Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Complutense de Madrid"}, "13907649300": {"Name": "Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez B.", "AuthorID": "13907649300", "AffiliationID": "60019290", "AffiliationName": "IIS-Fundaci\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez D\u00edaz"}, "25640140800": {"Name": "Oliver E.", "AuthorID": "25640140800", "AffiliationID": "60011100", "AffiliationName": "Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares"}, "6505896105": {"Name": "Sub\u00edas P.E.", "AuthorID": "6505896105", "AffiliationID": "60027282", "AffiliationName": "Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Complutense de Madrid"}, "57218773096": {"Name": "de la Cal T.S.", "AuthorID": "57218773096", "AffiliationID": "60004024, 60105312", "AffiliationName": "Servicio de Cardiolog\u00eda, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n Sanitaria Hospital"}, "57218774613": {"Name": "Delgado C.P.O.", "AuthorID": "57218774613", "AffiliationID": "60004024, 60105312", "AffiliationName": "Servicio de Cardiolog\u00eda, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n Sanitaria Hospital"}, "56517105700": {"Name": "L\u00f3pez-Medrano F.", "AuthorID": "56517105700", "AffiliationID": "60004024", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Instituto de Investigacio\u00f3n Sanitaria Hospital"}}}
