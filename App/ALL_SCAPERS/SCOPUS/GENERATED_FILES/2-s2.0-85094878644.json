However, bolt EVDs tend to be perceived as a more challenging technique, particularly when dealing with small ventricles or when there is midline shift distorting the ventricular morphology. Furthermore, if neuronavigation guidance is felt to be necessary, this usually assumes a transfer to an operating theatre. In this technical note, we describe the use of electromagnetic neuronavigation for bolt EVD insertion on the ICU and assess the protocol\u2019s feasibility and accuracy. Methods: Case series of neuronavigation-assisted bolt EVD insertion in ICU setting, using Medtronic Flat Emitter for StealthStation EM. Results: Neuronavigation-guided bolt EVDs were placed at the bedside in n = 5 patients on ICU. Their widest frontal ventricular horn diameter in the coronal plane ranged from 11 to 20 mm. No procedural complications were encountered. Post-procedural CT confirmed the optimal placement of the EVDs. Conclusions: Electromagnetic neuronavigation is feasible at the ICU bedside and can assist the insertion of bolt EVDs in this setting. The preference for a bolt EVD to be inserted in ICU\u2014as is standard practice at this unit\u2014should not prohibit patients from benefitting from image guidance if required.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bolt external ventricular drain", "Electromagnetic neuronavigation", "Intensive care unit", "Ventriculostomy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094878644", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55341098200": {"Name": "Cabrilo I.", "AuthorID": "55341098200", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Neurosurgery Department, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square, University College London Hospitals"}, "56419604800": {"Name": "Craven C.L.", "AuthorID": "56419604800", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Neurosurgery Department, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square, University College London Hospitals"}, "57219709745": {"Name": "Abuhusain H.", "AuthorID": "57219709745", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Neurosurgery Department, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square, University College London Hospitals"}, "57211073732": {"Name": "Pradini-Santos L.", "AuthorID": "57211073732", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Neurosurgery Department, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square, University College London Hospitals"}, "24069969200": {"Name": "Asif H.", "AuthorID": "24069969200", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Neurosurgery Department, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square, University College London Hospitals"}, "16643089500": {"Name": "Marcus H.J.", "AuthorID": "16643089500", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Neurosurgery Department, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square, University College London Hospitals"}, "7102438957": {"Name": "Watkins L.D.", "AuthorID": "7102438957", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Neurosurgery Department, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square, University College London Hospitals"}, "22958811100": {"Name": "Toma A.K.", "AuthorID": "22958811100", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Neurosurgery Department, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square, University College London Hospitals"}, "36911725200": {"Name": "Reddy U.", "AuthorID": "36911725200", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Neuro-intensive Care Department, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square, University College London Hospitals"}}}
