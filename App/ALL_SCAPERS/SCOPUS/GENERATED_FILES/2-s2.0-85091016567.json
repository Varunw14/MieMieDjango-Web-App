Methods: Using a naturalistic, interpretative approach, within Northwest England, a purposive sample of adult head and neck cancer patients was selected. Their family carers were invited to participate. Healthcare professionals (representing head and neck surgery and specialist nursing; oncology; specialist palliative care; general practice and community nursing) were recruited. All participants underwent face-to-face or telephone interviews. A thematic approach, using a modified version of Colazzi\u2019s framework, was used to analyze the data. Results: Seventeen interviews were conducted (9 patients, 4 joint with family carers and 8 healthcare professionals). Two main barriers were identified by healthcare professionals: \u201clack of consensus about timing of Specialist Palliative Care engagement\u201d and \u201chigh stake decisions with uncertainty about treatment outcome.\u201d The main barrier identified by patients and family carers was \u201clack of preparedness when transitioning from curable to incurable disease.\u201d There were 2 overlapping themes from both groups: \u201cuncertainty about meeting psychological needs\u201d and \u201cmisconceptions of palliative care.\u201d Conclusions: Head and neck cancer has a less predictable disease trajectory, where complex decisions are made and treatment outcomes are less certain. Specific focus is needed to define the optimal way to initiate Specialist Palliative Care referrals which may differ from those used for the wider cancer population. Clearer ways to effectively communicate goals of care are required potentially involving collaboration between Specialist Palliative Care and the wider head and neck cancer team.", "AuthorKeywords": ["end-of-life care", "head and neck cancer", "integrated care", "palliative care", "qualitative research"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091016567", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"6506654797": {"Name": "Mayland C.R.", "AuthorID": "6506654797", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Palliative Care Institute, University of Liverpool"}, "57219006607": {"Name": "Doughty H.C.", "AuthorID": "57219006607", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Mental Health, University of Liverpool"}, "35788306100": {"Name": "Mason S.", "AuthorID": "35788306100", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Palliative Care Institute, University of Liverpool"}, "57105908800": {"Name": "Rogers S.N.", "AuthorID": "57105908800", "AffiliationID": "60160274", "AffiliationName": "Aintree University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57206354534": {"Name": "Jack B.A.", "AuthorID": "57206354534", "AffiliationID": "60162382, 60022506", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Social Care, Edge Hill University"}, "57217036717": {"Name": "Macareavy D.", "AuthorID": "57217036717", "AffiliationID": "60160274", "AffiliationName": "Aintree University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56226371200": {"Name": "Gola A.", "AuthorID": "56226371200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Department, University College London"}, "57219006364": {"Name": "Hubbert C.", "AuthorID": "57219006364", "AffiliationID": "101804960", "AffiliationName": null}}}
