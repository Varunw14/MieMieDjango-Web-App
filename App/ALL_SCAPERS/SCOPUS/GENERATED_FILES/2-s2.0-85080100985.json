Raynaud phenomenon occurs in virtually all patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and is often the earliest clinical manifestation to occur. Careful assessment is required in patients with Raynaud phenomenon to avoid missing secondary causes such as SSc. Digital ulcers are a painful and disabling visible manifestation of digital vascular injury in patients with SSc. Progress has been made in the classification and assessment of digital ulcers and in understanding ulcer pathogenesis, and there are a wide range of treatments available to both prevent and heal digital ulcers, some of which are also used in Raynaud phenomenon management. In this Review, the assessment of patients with Raynaud phenomenon is discussed, including \u2018red flags\u2019 that are suggestive of SSc. The pathogenesis, classification and assessment of SSc-associated digital ulcers are also covered, alongside an overview of management approaches for SSc-associated Raynaud phenomenon and digital ulcers. Finally, unmet needs are discussed and the concept of a unified vascular phenotype in which therapies that affect the vasculature to support disease modification strategies is introduced.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Fingers", "Humans", "Raynaud Disease", "Scleroderma, Systemic", "Skin Ulcer"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85080100985", "SubjectAreas": [["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"]], "AuthorData": {"57210547929": {"Name": "Hughes M.", "AuthorID": "57210547929", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Musculoskeletal Research, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, The University of Manchester"}, "7003519327": {"Name": "Allanore Y.", "AuthorID": "7003519327", "AffiliationID": "60019163, 60123796, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, Cochin Hospital, AP-HP, Paris Descartes University"}, "57207967935": {"Name": "Chung L.", "AuthorID": "57207967935", "AffiliationID": "60028084, 60032838", "AffiliationName": "Division of Immunology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine and Palo Alto VA Health Care System"}, "24759261700": {"Name": "Pauling J.D.", "AuthorID": "24759261700", "AffiliationID": "60027647, 60000080", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases (part of Royal United Hospitals Bath NHS Foundation Trust)"}, "7006031021": {"Name": "Denton C.P.", "AuthorID": "7006031021", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, Royal Free Hospital, University College London"}, "7005642558": {"Name": "Matucci-Cerinic M.", "AuthorID": "7005642558", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Division of Rheumatology, University of Florence"}}}
