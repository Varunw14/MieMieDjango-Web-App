Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a critical process in the electrolysis of water. Recently, much effort has been dedicated to developing low-cost, highly efficient, and stable electrocatalysts. Transition metal phosphides are investigated intensively due to their high electronic conductivity and optimized absorption energy of intermediates in acid electrolytes. However, the low stability of metal phosphide materials in air and during electrocatalytic processes causes a decay of performance and hinders the discovery of specific active sites. The HER in alkaline media is more intricate, which requires further delicate design due to the Volmer steps. In this work, phosphorus-modified monoclinic \u03b2-CoMoO4 is developed as a low-cost, efficient, and stable HER electrocatalyst for the electrolysis of water in alkaline media. The optimized catalyst shows a small overpotential of 94 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm\u22122 for the HER with high stability in KOH electrolyte, and an overpotential of 197 mV to reach a current density of 100 mA cm\u22122. Combined computational and in situ spectroscopic techniques show P is present as a surface phosphate ion; that electron holes localize on the surface ions and both (P-O1\u2212) and Co3+-OH\u2212 are prospective surface active sites for the HER.", "AuthorKeywords": ["density functional theory", "electrocatalysts", "hydrogen evolution", "in situ ATR-IR"], "IndexKeywords": ["Absorption energies", "Electrocatalytic process", "Electrolysis of waters", "Electronic conductivity", "Hydrogen evolution", "In-situ spectroscopic techniques", "Surface active sites", "Transition metal phosphide"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083784480", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)", "BIOC", "1301"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57215220056": {"Name": "Zhao S.", "AuthorID": "57215220056", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Christopher Ingold Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57216526619": {"Name": "Berry-Gair J.", "AuthorID": "57216526619", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Christopher Ingold Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57216525042": {"Name": "Yang M.", "AuthorID": "57216525042", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Christopher Ingold Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57205155714": {"Name": "Li J.", "AuthorID": "57205155714", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Christopher Ingold Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55944154200": {"Name": "Cor\u00e0 F.", "AuthorID": "55944154200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Christopher Ingold Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7005668268": {"Name": "Holt K.", "AuthorID": "7005668268", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Christopher Ingold Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55626024600": {"Name": "He G.", "AuthorID": "55626024600", "AffiliationID": "60026830", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Lincoln, Joseph Banks Laboratories"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Christopher Ingold Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "51763877800": {"Name": "Li W.", "AuthorID": "51763877800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.J.L.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57189455897": {"Name": "Guan G.", "AuthorID": "57189455897", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory for Modification of Chemical Fibers and Polymer Materials, College of Materials Science and Engineering, Donghua University"}, "56688138200": {"Name": "Lai F.", "AuthorID": "56688138200", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory for Modification of Chemical Fibers and Polymer Materials, College of Materials Science and Engineering, Donghua University"}}}
