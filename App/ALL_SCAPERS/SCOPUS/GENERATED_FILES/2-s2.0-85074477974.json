MV structure abnormalities might cause valve regurgitation which in turn can lead to heart failure. Patient-specific computational models of the MV could provide a personalised understanding of MV mechanics, dysfunctions and possible interventions. In this study, we propose a semi-automatic pipeline for MV modelling based on the integration of state-of-the-art medical imaging, i.e. cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and 3D transoesophageal-echocardiogram (TOE) with fluid\u2013structure interaction (FSI) simulations. An FSI model of a patient with MV regurgitation was implemented using the finite element (FE) method and smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Our study showed the feasibility of combining image information and computer simulations to reproduce patient-specific MV mechanics as seen on medical images, and the potential for efficient in-silico studies of MV disease, personalised treatments and device design.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D transoesophageal-echocardiogram", "Cardiac magnetic resonance", "Fluid-structure interaction simulations", "Left heart", "Mitral valve", "Patient-specific modelling", "Smoothed particles hydrodynamics"], "IndexKeywords": ["3D transoesophageal-echocardiogram", "Anatomical structures", "Cardiac magnetic resonance", "Interaction analysis", "Mitral regurgitation", "Mitral valves", "Patient-specific modelling", "Smoothed particle hydrodynamics", "Electrocardiography", "Finite Element Analysis", "Hemodynamics", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mitral Valve", "Mitral Valve Insufficiency", "Patient-Specific Modeling", "Workflow"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074477974", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"57073707600": {"Name": "Biffi B.", "AuthorID": "57073707600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "55767012200": {"Name": "Milano E.G.", "AuthorID": "55767012200", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Cardiovascular Engineering, UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science & Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "57211576298": {"Name": "Alkareef H.", "AuthorID": "57211576298", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Cardiovascular Engineering, UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science & Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "57199718533": {"Name": "Sauvage E.", "AuthorID": "57199718533", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Cardiovascular Engineering, UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science & Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "57211580716": {"Name": "Maria Bosi G.", "AuthorID": "57211580716", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Cardiovascular Engineering, UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science & Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "13410386200": {"Name": "Schievano S.", "AuthorID": "13410386200", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Cardiovascular Engineering, UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science & Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "24922737800": {"Name": "Capelli C.", "AuthorID": "24922737800", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Cardiovascular Engineering, UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science & Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "57211574081": {"Name": "Gritti M.", "AuthorID": "57211574081", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60029950", "AffiliationName": "The National Amyloidosis Centre, Division of Medicine, UCL Medical School, Royal Free Hospital"}, "16306839900": {"Name": "Fontana M.", "AuthorID": "16306839900", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60029950", "AffiliationName": "The National Amyloidosis Centre, Division of Medicine, UCL Medical School, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57211580265": {"Name": "Anderson S.", "AuthorID": "57211580265", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60029950", "AffiliationName": "The National Amyloidosis Centre, Division of Medicine, UCL Medical School, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57211583198": {"Name": "Lorusso D.", "AuthorID": "57211583198", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60029950", "AffiliationName": "The National Amyloidosis Centre, Division of Medicine, UCL Medical School, Royal Free Hospital"}, "25723207100": {"Name": "Grasso A.", "AuthorID": "25723207100", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "6507903916": {"Name": "Davar J.", "AuthorID": "6507903916", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "8434302300": {"Name": "Jeetley P.", "AuthorID": "8434302300", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "36647033100": {"Name": "Whelan C.", "AuthorID": "36647033100", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
