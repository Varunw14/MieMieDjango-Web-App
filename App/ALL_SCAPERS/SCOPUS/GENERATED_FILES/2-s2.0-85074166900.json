To improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease, we conducted a genome-wide DNA methylation profiling in granulosa lutein cells collected from 16 women suffering from PCOS, in comparison to 16 healthy controls. Samples were collected by follicular aspiration during routine egg collection for IVF treatment. Study groups were matched for age and BMI, did not suffer from other disease and were not taking confounding medication. Comparing women with polycystic versus normal ovarian morphology, after correcting for multiple comparisons, we identified 106 differentially methylated CpG sites with p-values <5.8 \u00d7 10\u22128 that were associated with 88 genes, several of which are known to relate either to PCOS or to ovarian function. Replication and validation of the experiment was done using pyrosequencing to analyse six of the identified differentially methylated sites. Pathway analysis indicated potential disruption in canonical pathways and gene networks that are, amongst other, associated with cancer, cardiogenesis, Hedgehog signalling and immune response. In conclusion, these novel findings indicate that women with PCOS display epigenetic changes in ovarian granulosa cells that may be associated with the heterogeneity of the disorder.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DNA methylation", "EWAS", "Metabolic syndrome", "PCOS", "Reproduction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Case-Control Studies", "DNA Methylation", "DNA Mutational Analysis", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Female", "Gene Regulatory Networks", "Humans", "Luteal Cells", "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome", "Whole Genome Sequencing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074166900", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"57211487961": {"Name": "Makrinou E.", "AuthorID": "57211487961", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London, Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology"}, "57201073865": {"Name": "Lerner A.", "AuthorID": "57201073865", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London, Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology"}, "57211483070": {"Name": "Chapa-Chorda I.", "AuthorID": "57211483070", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London, Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology"}, "35512807500": {"Name": "Hardy K.", "AuthorID": "35512807500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London, Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology"}, "7102615765": {"Name": "Franks S.", "AuthorID": "7102615765", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London, Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology"}, "57202126567": {"Name": "Drong A.W.", "AuthorID": "57202126567", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Big Data Institute at the Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Information and Discovery, University of Oxford"}, "57218362371": {"Name": "Lindgren C.M.", "AuthorID": "57218362371", "AffiliationID": "60001001", "AffiliationName": "Program in Medical and Population Genetics, Broad Institute"}, "55753877700": {"Name": "Christopoulos G.", "AuthorID": "55753877700", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60111785", "AffiliationName": "IVF Unit, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "7003683036": {"Name": "Lavery S.", "AuthorID": "7003683036", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60111785", "AffiliationName": "IVF Unit, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "26424286300": {"Name": "Karaderi T.", "AuthorID": "26424286300", "AffiliationID": "60071323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Eastern Mediterranean University"}}}
