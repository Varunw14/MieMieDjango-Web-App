Inappropriate and inaccurate penicillin allergy labelling is a barrier to antimicrobial stewardship and can lead to patient harm. This review assesses an emergent evidence base and trend favouring delabelling using direct oral penicillin challenges following a stratified risk assessment of the likelihood and existence of true penicillin allergy, to identify and make recommendations for key components for implementation in standard practice. Research to date has focussed on the feasibility and clinical and financial outcomes of these direct delabelling strategies. There is a paucity of studies exploring the views and engagement of patients and healthcare professionals, and a gap in the evidence for prerequisites to safely deliver, sustain and spread the implementation of such services across health systems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Allergy", "improvement science", "patient safety", "penicillin"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078682982", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"6603352762": {"Name": "Jani Y.H.", "AuthorID": "6603352762", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medicines Optimisation Research and Education, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust & UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "15063758900": {"Name": "Williams I.", "AuthorID": "15063758900", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Health Services Management Centre, University of Birmingham"}, "55827578700": {"Name": "Krishna M.T.", "AuthorID": "55827578700", "AffiliationID": "60026493, 60019702", "AffiliationName": "University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust and Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham"}}}
