Owing to such conditions, we demonstrate the feedback this landscape in Garhwal Himalaya in response to episodic tectonic uplift and monsoon precipitation. We calculated conventional geomorphic parameters to access the tectonic deformation across the major thrusts and faults. We further analyzed the normalized steepness index (Ksn), Chi (\u03c7), and knickpoints along the longitudinal course of rivers. Additionally, the study attributed to active nature of Chail/Ramgarh thrust along the Balganga valley as envisaged by five levels of unpaired fluvial terraces, entrenched stream course, river ponding, active and stabilized landslide deposits, etc. Moreover, the flooding during the heavy rainfall events induced river toe cutting makes an effect on settlement over fluvial deposits. Therefore, we suggested that the highly dissected and tilted basins with deep V shaped valleys and ongoing seismicity also fabricates the region more vulnerable for hazards which threaten the human lives.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Garhwal himalaya", "Landscape evolution", "Morphotectonic analysis", "Tectonic imprints"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089012237", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"]], "AuthorData": {"57193899636": {"Name": "Taloor A.K.", "AuthorID": "57193899636", "AffiliationID": "60031541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Remote Sensing and GIS, University of Jammu"}, "57196538727": {"Name": "Joshi L.M.", "AuthorID": "57196538727", "AffiliationID": "60002280", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Advanced Study in Geology, Kumaun University"}, "6603729296": {"Name": "Kotlia B.S.", "AuthorID": "6603729296", "AffiliationID": "60002280", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Advanced Study in Geology, Kumaun University"}, "55991333400": {"Name": "Alam A.", "AuthorID": "55991333400", "AffiliationID": "60016300", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography & Regional Development, University of Kashmir"}, "12792682800": {"Name": "Kothyari G.C.", "AuthorID": "12792682800", "AffiliationID": "60097642", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Seismological Research Gandhinagar"}, "56957140300": {"Name": "Kandregula R.S.", "AuthorID": "56957140300", "AffiliationID": "60097642", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Seismological Research Gandhinagar"}, "23567617800": {"Name": "Dumka R.K.", "AuthorID": "23567617800", "AffiliationID": "60097642", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Seismological Research Gandhinagar"}, "57212846091": {"Name": "Singh A.K.", "AuthorID": "57212846091", "AffiliationID": "60004095", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geology, Lucknow University"}}}
