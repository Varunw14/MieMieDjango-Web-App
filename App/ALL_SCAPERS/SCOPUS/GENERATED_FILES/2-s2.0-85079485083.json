We show how the topological phases at half-filling can be characterized by a reduced Zak phase defined based on the reduced density matrix of each spin subsystem. Signatures of bulk\u2013boundary correspondence are observed in the triplon excitation of the bulk and the edge states of uncoupled spins at the boundaries. At quarter-filling, we show that owing to the presence of the Hubbard interaction the system can undergo a transition to the topological ground state of the non-interacting Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger model with the application of a moderate-strength external magnetic field. We propose a robust experimental realization with a chain of dopant atoms in silicon or gate-defined quantum dots in GaAs where the transition can be probed by measuring the tunneling current through the many-body state of the chain.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Artificial lattice", "Experimental realizations", "External magnetic field", "Hubbard interaction", "Quantum simulations", "Reduced-density matrix", "Topological materials", "Topological phasis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079485083", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (miscellaneous)", "COMP", "1701"], ["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"]], "AuthorData": {"57200092580": {"Name": "Le N.H.", "AuthorID": "57200092580", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Technology Institute and Department of Physics, University of Surrey"}, "56495169700": {"Name": "Ginossar E.", "AuthorID": "56495169700", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Technology Institute and Department of Physics, University of Surrey"}, "7403451968": {"Name": "Fisher A.J.", "AuthorID": "7403451968", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy and London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "6701786801": {"Name": "Curson N.J.", "AuthorID": "6701786801", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering and London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}}}
