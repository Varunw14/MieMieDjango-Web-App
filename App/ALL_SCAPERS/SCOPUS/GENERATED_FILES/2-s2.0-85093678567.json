HIV-associated immune dysfunction and inflammation have been suggested to contribute to this age advancement and increased risk of comorbidities. Method: Partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to explore associations between biological age advancement and immunological changes in the T cell and monocyte compartment in people with HIV (n=40), comparable HIV-negative individuals (n=40) participating in the Comorbidity in Relation to AIDS (COBRA) cohort, and blood donors (n=35). Results: We observed that age advancement in all three groups combined was associated with a monocyte immune phenotypic profile related to inflammation and a T cell immune phenotypic associated with immune senescence and chronic antigen exposure. Interestingly, a unique monocyte and T cell immune phenotypic profile predictive for age advancement was found within each group. An inflammatory monocyte immune phenotypic profile associated with age advancement in HIV-negative individuals, while the monocyte profile in blood donors and people with HIV was more reflective of loss of function. The T cell immune phenotypic profile in blood donors was related to loss of T cell function, whereas the same set of markers were related to chronic antigen stimulation and immune senescence in HIV-negative individuals. In people with HIV, age advancement was related to changes in the CD4+ T cell compartment and more reflective of immune recovery after cART treatment. Impact: The identified monocyte and T cell immune phenotypic profiles that were associated with age advancement, were strongly related to inflammation, chronic antigen exposure and immune senescence. While the monocyte and T cell immune phenotypic profile within the HIV-negative individuals reflected those observed in the combined three groups, a distinct profile related to immune dysfunction, was observed within blood donors and people with HIV. These data suggest that varying exposures to lifestyle and infection-related factors may be associated with specific changes in the innate and adaptive immune system, that all contribute to age advancement.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aging", "HIV", "immune activation", "immune dysfunction", "inflammation", "monocyte", "T cell"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85093678567", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"56074756400": {"Name": "De Francesco D.", "AuthorID": "56074756400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "57216577030": {"Name": "Sabin C.A.", "AuthorID": "57216577030", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "7005073010": {"Name": "Reiss P.", "AuthorID": "7005073010", "AffiliationID": "60172322", "AffiliationName": "HIV Monitoring Foundation"}, "6603966335": {"Name": "Kootstra N.A.", "AuthorID": "6603966335", "AffiliationID": "60001157, 60002483", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Immunology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
