The powerful combination of the techniques has been the driving force to design and engineer suitable spectroscopic operando reactors that can mitigate limitations inherent to conventional reaction cells and facilitate experiments under kinetic regimes. Microreactors have recently emerged as effective spectroscopic operando cells due to their plug-flow type operation with no dead volume and negligible mass and heat transfer resistances. Here we present a novel microfabricated reactor that can be used for both operando XAS and DRIFTS studies. The reactor has a glass-silicon-glass sandwich-like structure with a reaction channel (3000 \u03bcm \u00d7 600 \u03bcm; width \u00d7 depth) packed with a catalyst bed (ca. 25 mg) and placed sideways to the X-ray beam, while the infrared beam illuminates the catalyst bed from the top. The outlet of the reactor is connected to MS for continuous monitoring of the reactor effluent. The feasibility of the microreactor is demonstrated by conducting two reactions: i) combustion of methane over 2 wt% Pd/Al2O3 studied by operando XAS at the Pd K-edge and ii) CO oxidation over 1 wt% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst studied by operando DRIFTS. The former shows that palladium is in an oxidised state at all studied temperatures, 250, 300, 350, 400 \u00b0C and the latter shows the presence of linearly adsorbed CO on the platinum surface. Furthermore, temperature-resolved reduction of palladium catalyst with methane and CO oxidation over platinum catalyst are also studied. Based on these results, the catalyst structure and surface reaction dynamics are discussed, which demonstrate not only the applicability and versatility of the microreactor for combined operando XAS and DRIFTS studies, but also illustrate the unique advantages of the microreactor for high space velocity and transient response experiments.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Catalyst structures", "Continuous monitoring", "Diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopies", "Heterogeneous catalytic reactions", "Mass and heat transfers", "Microfabricated reactors", "Sandwich-like structure", "Surface reaction mechanism"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85098095829", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"]], "AuthorData": {"57193182782": {"Name": "Venezia B.", "AuthorID": "57193182782", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "9241458400": {"Name": "Cao E.", "AuthorID": "9241458400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56640992900": {"Name": "Waldron C.", "AuthorID": "56640992900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003522751": {"Name": "Gavriilidis A.", "AuthorID": "7003522751", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "55909685500": {"Name": "Matam S.K.", "AuthorID": "55909685500", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff Catalysis Institute, School of Chemistry, Cardiff University"}, "8306766600": {"Name": "Gibson E.K.", "AuthorID": "8306766600", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Glasgow"}, "7201752667": {"Name": "Wells P.P.", "AuthorID": "7201752667", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Southampton"}, "57218594176": {"Name": "Catlow C.R.A.", "AuthorID": "57218594176", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6701577282": {"Name": "Golunski S.", "AuthorID": "6701577282", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff Catalysis Institute, School of Chemistry, Cardiff University"}, "6603438328": {"Name": "Cibin G.", "AuthorID": "6603438328", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd.
