This approach yielded LPCMP1-4, CMPs with significantly higher Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas (more than 5 times higher) than other related BH-based CMPs. These CMPs possess not only high BET specific surface areas and high chemical and thermal stabilities, but also exhibit outstanding swellability. To the best of our knowledge, swellable behavior was studied in great detail for CMPs for the first time, with the greatest degree of swelling for methanol reaching 16.5 and 16.3 mL g-1 for LPCMP1 and LPCMP3, respectively. Owing to their excellent swellability, we further studied the adsorption capacity of these CMPs for different toxic organic vapors (including toluene and methanol). LPCMP1 and LPCMP3 adsorbed 124 and 117 mg g-1 toluene, respectively, at saturated vapor pressure. For methanol, the adsorption capacities of LPCMP1 and LPCMP3 were up to 250 and 215 mg g-1, respectively, which are the highest recorded values when compared with published data for CMPs, HCPs, MOFs, and porous carbons. These materials are promising candidates for the removal and elimination of hazardous organic vapors and chemical warfare agents. Moreover, all the polymers show high sensitivity to nitroaromatic explosives. LPCMP2 and LPCMP4 exhibit high selectivity for TNT and may be suitable as new candidates to selectively detect TNT for security or environmental applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["conjugated microporous polymers", "detection of nitroaromatic", "fluorescence", "methanol adsorption", "swellability"], "IndexKeywords": ["BET specific surface area", "Brunauer-emmett-teller surface areas", "Conjugated microporous polymers", "Environmental applications", "Methanol adsorption", "Nitroaromatic explosives", "Saturated vapor pressure", "Swellability"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076808860", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57217071936": {"Name": "Pan L.", "AuthorID": "57217071936", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Bristol"}, "56210377800": {"Name": "Faul C.F.J.", "AuthorID": "56210377800", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Bristol"}, "57203715293": {"Name": "Liu Z.", "AuthorID": "57203715293", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "37116115600": {"Name": "Schroeder B.C.", "AuthorID": "37116115600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7102384385": {"Name": "Aliev A.E.", "AuthorID": "7102384385", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57189728817": {"Name": "Tian M.", "AuthorID": "57189728817", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Bath"}}}
