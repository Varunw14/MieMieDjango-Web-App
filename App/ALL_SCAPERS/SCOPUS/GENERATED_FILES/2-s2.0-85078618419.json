Ageing in workers is often associated with a temporal polyethism in the tasks performed both inside and outside the colony. Such behavioral transition is sometimes linked to a gradual reduction in individual immunity. Here, we studied the immune ability of Apis mellifera guard bees, which represent an intermediate stage between house bees working inside the nest and foragers collecting resources outside, to assess if their specific task is associated with an immune specialization. Through immune challenge with Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, we compared the guards ability to clear bacterial cells from their haemolymph with respect to house bees and foragers. Our findings demonstrate that guards do not show an immune specialization linked to their task but seem to represent a transition also in terms of immunity, since their anti-bacterial response appears intermediate between house bees and foragers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Apis mellifera", "bacterial clearance", "division of labor", "Escherichia coli", "immune challenge"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078618419", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Animal Science and Zoology", "AGRI", "1103"]], "AuthorData": {"54788783100": {"Name": "Cappa F.", "AuthorID": "54788783100", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Biology Department, University of Florence"}, "35768356400": {"Name": "Petrocelli I.", "AuthorID": "35768356400", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Biology Department, University of Florence"}, "22133717200": {"Name": "Cini A.", "AuthorID": "22133717200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research, University College London"}, "57200581687": {"Name": "Pepiciello I.", "AuthorID": "57200581687", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Biology Department, University of Florence"}, "57207193991": {"Name": "Giovannini M.", "AuthorID": "57207193991", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Biology Department, University of Florence"}, "55570015000": {"Name": "Lazzeri A.M.", "AuthorID": "55570015000", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Biology Department, University of Florence"}, "6507496691": {"Name": "Perito B.", "AuthorID": "6507496691", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Biology Department, University of Florence"}, "7006953870": {"Name": "Turillazzi S.", "AuthorID": "7006953870", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Biology Department, University of Florence"}, "6603953920": {"Name": "Cervo R.", "AuthorID": "6603953920", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Biology Department, University of Florence"}}}
