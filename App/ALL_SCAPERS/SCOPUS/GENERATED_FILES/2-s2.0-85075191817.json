Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Long-haul optical fiber communication employing digital signal processing (DSP)-based dispersion compensation can be distorted by the phenomenon of equalization-enhanced phase noise (EEPN), due to the reciprocities between the dispersion compensation unit and the local oscillator (LO) laser phase noise (LPN). The impact of EEPN scales increases with the increase of the fiber dispersion, laser linewidths, symbol rates, signal bandwidths, and the order of modulation formats. In this work, the phase noise cancellation (PNC) employing a radio frequency (RF) pilot tone in coherent optical transmission systems has been investigated. A 28-Gsym/s QPSK optical transmission system with a significant EEPN has been implemented, where the carrier phase recovery (CPR) was realized using the one-tap normalized least-mean-square (NLMS) estimation and the differential phase detection (DPD), respectively. It is shown that the RF pilot tone can entirely eliminate the LPN and efficiently suppress the EEPN when it is applied prior to the CPR.", "AuthorKeywords": ["carrier phase recovery (CPR)", "coherent optical fiber communication", "equalization enhanced phase noise (EEPN)", "laser phase noise (LPN)", "phase noise cancellation (PNC)", "radio frequency (RF) pilot tone"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075191817", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Process Chemistry and Technology", "CENG", "1508"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes", "CENG", "1507"]], "AuthorData": {"7401627190": {"Name": "Xu T.", "AuthorID": "7401627190", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, University College London"}, "7405910538": {"Name": "Liu T.", "AuthorID": "7405910538", "AffiliationID": "60019533", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Opto-Electronic Information Technology (MoE), School of Precision Instruments and Opto-Electronics Engineering, Tianjin University"}, "57211869303": {"Name": "Jin C.", "AuthorID": "57211869303", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Warwick"}, "7006572210": {"Name": "Leeson M.", "AuthorID": "7006572210", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Warwick"}, "57204177308": {"Name": "Zhang S.", "AuthorID": "57204177308", "AffiliationID": "60019616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Optical Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology"}, "7102705046": {"Name": "Jacobsen G.", "AuthorID": "7102705046", "AffiliationID": "60002014", "AffiliationName": "Optics and Photonics Group, KTH Royal Institute of Technology"}, "7202624351": {"Name": "Popov S.", "AuthorID": "7202624351", "AffiliationID": "60002014", "AffiliationName": "Optics and Photonics Group, KTH Royal Institute of Technology"}}}
