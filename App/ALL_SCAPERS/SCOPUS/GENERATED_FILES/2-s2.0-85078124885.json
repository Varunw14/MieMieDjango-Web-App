This study investigated whether and how bilinguals' code-switching practices modulate different aspects of executive functioning. Our findings suggest that existing processing models of code-switching should be extended by a dual control mode perspective, differentiating between reactive and proactive monitoring. Bilinguals engaging in code-switching types that keep languages more separate (Alternation) displayed inhibitory advantages in a flanker task inducing reactive control. Dense code-switching, which requires bilinguals to constantly monitor cross-linguistic competition, explained performance in proactive monitoring conditions. Furthermore, a correlation between Dense code-switching and response inhibition suggests that linguistic co-activation may persist during articulatory stages of language processing. Crucially, bilinguals outperformed monolinguals at those aspects of the executive system that were trained by their most frequent code-switching habits. This underlines the importance of sociolinguistic variables in bilingualism research.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bilingualism", "code-switching", "executive functions", "interference suppression", "response inhibition"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078124885", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"57191590322": {"Name": "Hofweber J.", "AuthorID": "57191590322", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012197", "AffiliationName": "University College London, University of Reading"}, "12753856900": {"Name": "Marinis T.", "AuthorID": "12753856900", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "University of Reading"}, "55665478600": {"Name": "Treffers-Daller J.", "AuthorID": "55665478600", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "University of Reading"}}}
