The technique has become increasingly popular as a tool for the training of brain self-regulation, fueled by the superiority in spatial resolution and fidelity brought along with real-time analysis of fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) data, compared to the more traditional EEG (electroencephalography) approach. NF learning is a complex phenomenon and a controversial discussion on its feasibility and mechanisms has arisen in the literature. Critical aspects of the design of fMRI-NF studies include the localization of neural targets, cognitive and operant aspects of the training procedure, personalization of training, and the definition of training success, both through neural effects and (for studies with therapeutic aims) through clinical effects. In this paper, we argue that a developmental perspective should inform neural target selection particularly for pediatric populations, and different success metrics may allow in-depth analysis of NF learning. The relevance of the functional neuroanatomy of NF learning for brain target selection is discussed. Furthermore, we address controversial topics such as the role of strategy instructions, sometimes given to subjects in order to facilitate learning, and the timing of feedback. Discussion of these topics opens sight on problems that require further conceptual and empirical work, in order to improve the impact that fMRI-NF could have on basic and applied research in future.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BCI", "Developmental cognitive neuroscience", "Multivariate pattern analysis", "Neurofeedback", "Real-time fMRI", "Review", "Translational research"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Neurofeedback"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072559346", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"55376138200": {"Name": "Paret C.", "AuthorID": "55376138200", "AffiliationID": "60005681", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychological Science and Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University"}, "56866295200": {"Name": "Goldway N.", "AuthorID": "56866295200", "AffiliationID": "60005681", "AffiliationName": "Sagol School of Neuroscience Tel Aviv University"}, "57185701800": {"Name": "Keynan J.N.", "AuthorID": "57185701800", "AffiliationID": "60005681", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychological Science and Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University"}, "7004564546": {"Name": "Hendler T.", "AuthorID": "7004564546", "AffiliationID": "60005681", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychological Science and Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University"}, "55916575100": {"Name": "Zich C.", "AuthorID": "55916575100", "AffiliationID": "60020306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Oldenburg"}, "12243251700": {"Name": "Cohen Kadosh K.", "AuthorID": "12243251700", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Surrey"}, "7102905437": {"Name": "Linden D.", "AuthorID": "7102905437", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "School of Mental Health and Neuroscience, Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences, Maastricht University"}}}
