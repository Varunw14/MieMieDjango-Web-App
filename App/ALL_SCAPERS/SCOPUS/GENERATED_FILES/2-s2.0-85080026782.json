Secondary degeneration is believed to be the major contributor to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death, the endpoint of optic neuropathy. Partial optic nerve transection (pONT) is an established model of optic neuropathy. Although the mechanisms of primary and secondary degeneration have been delineated in this model, until now how this is influenced by therapy is not well-understood. In this article, we describe a clinically translatable topical, neuroprotective treatment (recombinant human nerve growth factor, rh-NGF) predominantly targeting secondary degeneration in a pONT rat model. Topical application of rh-NGF twice daily for 3 weeks significantly improves RGC survival as shown by reduced RGC apoptosis in vivo and increased RGC population in the inferior retina, which is predominantly affected in this model by secondary degeneration. Topical rh-NGF also promotes greater axonal survival and inhibits astrocyte activity in the optic nerve. Collectively, these results suggest that topical rh-NGF exhibits neuroprotective effects on retinal neurons via influencing secondary degeneration process. As topical rh-NGF is already involved in early clinical trials, this highlights its potential in multiple indications in patients, including those affected by glaucomatous optic neuropathy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Topical", "Animals", "Apoptosis", "Axons", "Cell Survival", "Disease Models, Animal", "Drug Administration Schedule", "Humans", "Male", "Nerve Growth Factor", "Neuroprotective Agents", "Optic Nerve Injuries", "Rats", "Recombinant Proteins", "Retina", "Retinal Ganglion Cells"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85080026782", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"42561262400": {"Name": "Guo L.", "AuthorID": "42561262400", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "36909794600": {"Name": "Davis B.M.", "AuthorID": "36909794600", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57194035424": {"Name": "Ravindran N.", "AuthorID": "57194035424", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "37112209300": {"Name": "Galvao J.", "AuthorID": "37112209300", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57215183738": {"Name": "Kapoor N.", "AuthorID": "57215183738", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "55860183700": {"Name": "Haamedi N.", "AuthorID": "55860183700", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57195998108": {"Name": "Shamsher E.", "AuthorID": "57195998108", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57215196309": {"Name": "Luong V.", "AuthorID": "57215196309", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57201944789": {"Name": "Fico E.", "AuthorID": "57201944789", "AffiliationID": "60018783", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biotechnological and Applied Clinical Sciences, University of L'Aquila"}, "57210287162": {"Name": "Cordeiro M.F.", "AuthorID": "57210287162", "AffiliationID": "60016550, 60111785", "AffiliationName": "Western Eye Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}}}
