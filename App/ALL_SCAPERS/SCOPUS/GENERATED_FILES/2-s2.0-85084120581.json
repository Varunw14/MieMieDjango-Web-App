An integrated design of transport infrastructure and public space is beneficial for mediating these negative impacts. In this paper, we propose an integrated methodology, which combines urban design, computational scenario evaluation and decision-making processes, based on a conceptual model of human and ecological needs-driven planning. To evaluate the impacts of the road network and public space design on individual outdoor activities, travel behavior and air pollution, an agent-based model is demonstrated. This model is then applied to a case study in Beijing, leading to hourly traffic volume maps and car-related air pollution heat maps of a baseline road network-public space design.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Agent-based modeling", "Air pollution simulation", "Environmental evaluation", "Human behavior", "Policy-making support", "Public space", "Urban transport infrastructure"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084120581", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"57211687492": {"Name": "Yang L.", "AuthorID": "57211687492", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "Center of Architecture Research and Design, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "8278082900": {"Name": "van Dam K.H.", "AuthorID": "8278082900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "56442218700": {"Name": "Anvari B.", "AuthorID": "56442218700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Transport Studies, University College London"}, "6504250744": {"Name": "de Nazelle A.", "AuthorID": "6504250744", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Environmental Policy, Imperial College London"}}}
