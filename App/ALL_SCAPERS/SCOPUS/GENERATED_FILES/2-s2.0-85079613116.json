In addition, a wealth of studies have led to the conclusion that the commensal microbiota (mainly bacteria) within the intestine contributes to host homeostasis by regulating circadian rhythmicity, metabolism, and the immune system. Experimental studies on how these four biological domains interact with each other have mainly focused on any two of those domains at a time and only occasionally on three. However, a systematic analysis of how these four domains concurrently interact with each other seems to be missing. We have analyzed current evidence that signposts a role for mitochondria as a key hub that supports and integrates activity across all four domains, circadian clocks, metabolic pathways, the intestinal microbiota, and the immune system, coordinating their integration and crosstalk. This work will hopefully provide a new perspective for both hypothesis-building and more systematic experimental approaches.", "AuthorKeywords": ["circadian rhythmicity", "immune system", "intestinal microbiota", "metabolism", "mitochondria"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079613116", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57204875060": {"Name": "Aguilar-L\u00f3pez B.A.", "AuthorID": "57204875060", "AffiliationID": "60019176", "AffiliationName": "Laboratorio de Inmunorregulaci\u00f3n, Departamento de Inmunolog\u00eda, Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biol\u00f3gicas, Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional"}, "6507417733": {"Name": "Moreno-Altamirano M.M.B.", "AuthorID": "6507417733", "AffiliationID": "60019176", "AffiliationName": "Laboratorio de Inmunorregulaci\u00f3n, Departamento de Inmunolog\u00eda, Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biol\u00f3gicas, Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional"}, "7003798055": {"Name": "S\u00e1nchez-Garc\u00eda F.J.", "AuthorID": "7003798055", "AffiliationID": "60019176", "AffiliationName": "Laboratorio de Inmunorregulaci\u00f3n, Departamento de Inmunolog\u00eda, Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biol\u00f3gicas, Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional"}, "56931730800": {"Name": "Dockrell H.M.", "AuthorID": "56931730800", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection Biology, London School of Hygiene Tropical Medicine"}, "7005847722": {"Name": "Duchen M.R.", "AuthorID": "7005847722", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}}}
