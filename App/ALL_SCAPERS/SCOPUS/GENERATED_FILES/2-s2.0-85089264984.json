The genetic basis of prostate cancer visibility and invisibility on mpMRI remains uncertain. Objective: To systematically review the literature on differential gene expression between mpMRI-visible and mpMRI-invisible prostate cancer, and to use bioinformatic analysis to identify enriched processes or cellular components in genes validated in more than one study. Evidence acquisition: We performed a systematic literature search of the Medline, EMBASE, PubMed, and Cochrane databases up to January 2020 in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. The primary endpoint was differential genetic features between mpMRI-visible and mpMRI-invisible tumours. Secondary endpoints were explanatory links between gene function and mpMRI conspicuity, and the prognostic value of differential gene enrichment. Evidence synthesis: We retrieved 445 articles, of which 32 met the criteria for inclusion. Thematic synthesis from the included studies showed that mpMRI-visible cancer tended towards enrichment of molecular features associated with increased disease aggressivity, including phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) loss and higher genomic classifier scores, such as Oncotype and Decipher. Three of the included studies had accompanying publicly available data suitable for further bioinformatic analysis. An over-representation analysis of these datasets revealed increased expression of genes associated with extracellular matrix components in mpMRI-visible tumours. Conclusions: Prostate cancer that is visible on mpMRI is generally enriched with molecular features of tumour development and aggressivity, including activation of proliferative signalling, DNA damage, and inflammatory processes. Additionally, there appears to be concordant cellular components and biological processes associated with mpMRI conspicuity, as highlighted by bioinformatic analysis of large genetic datasets. Patient summary: Prostate cancer that is detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tends to have genetic features that are associated with more aggressive disease. This suggests that MRI can be used to assess the likelihood of aggressive prostate cancer, based on tumour visibility. The genomic evidence surrounding multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) visibility is varied and often discordant; however, the literature suggests that tumour mpMRI visibility correlates with aggressive genomic features.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bioinformatic analysis", "Genetics", "Genomics", "Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging", "Prostate cancer", "Systematic review"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089264984", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"55192676400": {"Name": "Norris J.M.", "AuthorID": "55192676400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57210910366": {"Name": "Simpson B.S.", "AuthorID": "57210910366", "AffiliationID": "60176023, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London"}, "35336774700": {"Name": "Kasivisvanathan V.", "AuthorID": "35336774700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57211975112": {"Name": "Whitaker H.C.", "AuthorID": "57211975112", "AffiliationID": "60176023, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London"}, "7004667094": {"Name": "Emberton M.", "AuthorID": "7004667094", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57196813076": {"Name": "Parry M.A.", "AuthorID": "57196813076", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "7402266611": {"Name": "Allen C.", "AuthorID": "7402266611", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "15053220400": {"Name": "Kirkham A.", "AuthorID": "15053220400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57212561286": {"Name": "Ball R.", "AuthorID": "57212561286", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8972541300": {"Name": "Freeman A.", "AuthorID": "8972541300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7403137588": {"Name": "Kelly D.", "AuthorID": "7403137588", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Healthcare Sciences, Cardiff University"}, "7410128662": {"Name": "Kim H.L.", "AuthorID": "7410128662", "AffiliationID": "60016173", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"}, "24069443900": {"Name": "You S.", "AuthorID": "24069443900", "AffiliationID": "60016173", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"}}}
