We aimed to assess the concordance between CA-125 and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) criteria for progression in patients with BRCA mutations on maintenance PARPi or placebo. Methods: We extracted data on progression as defined by Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup CA-125, investigator- and independent central-assessed RECIST from the SOLO2/ENGOT-ov21(NCT01874353) trial. We excluded those with progression other than by RECIST, progression on date of randomisation, and no repeat CA-125 beyond baseline. We evaluated the concordance between CA-125 progression and RECIST progression, and assessed the negative (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV). Results: Of 295 randomised patients, 275 (184 olaparib, 91 placebo) were included. 171 patients had investigator-assessed RECIST progression. Of 80 patients with CA-125 progression, 77 had concordant RECIST progression (PPV 96%, 95% confidence interval 90\u201399%). Of 195 patients without CA-125 progression, 94 had RECIST progression (NPV 52%, 45\u201359%). Within treatment arms, PPV was similar (olaparib: 95% [84\u201399%], placebo: 97% [87\u2013100%]) but NPV was lower in patients on placebo (olaparib: 60% [52\u201368%], placebo: 30% [20\u201344%]). Of 94 patients with RECIST but without CA-125 progression, 64 (68%) had CA-125 that remained within normal range. We observed similar findings using independent-assessed RECIST. Conclusions: Almost half the patients without CA-125 progression had RECIST progression, and most of these had CA-125 within the normal range. Regular computed tomography imaging should be considered as part of surveillance in patients treated with or without maintenance olaparib rather than relying on CA-125 alone.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BRCA mutation", "CA-125", "CT", "Olaparib", "Ovarian cancer", "Poly(ADP-Ribose) polymerase inhibitors", "Response evaluation criteria in solid tumours"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091255673", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"55331681900": {"Name": "Tjokrowidjaja A.", "AuthorID": "55331681900", "AffiliationID": "60000260", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, St George Hospital"}, "35329796000": {"Name": "Lee C.K.", "AuthorID": "35329796000", "AffiliationID": "60000260", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, St George Hospital"}, "16233175200": {"Name": "Gebski V.", "AuthorID": "16233175200", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60088313", "AffiliationName": "National Health and Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Centre, The University of Sydney"}, "57195998975": {"Name": "Asher R.", "AuthorID": "57195998975", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60088313", "AffiliationName": "National Health and Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Centre, The University of Sydney"}, "57203084835": {"Name": "Lord S.J.", "AuthorID": "57203084835", "AffiliationID": "60031487", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, The University of Notre Dame"}, "55021516700": {"Name": "Friedlander M.", "AuthorID": "55021516700", "AffiliationID": "60001801", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, Prince of Wales Hospital"}, "57202563903": {"Name": "Gladieff L.", "AuthorID": "57202563903", "AffiliationID": "60025238", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, Institut Claudius Regaud, IUCT-Oncopole"}, "7007134127": {"Name": "Ledermann J.", "AuthorID": "7007134127", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "7006892163": {"Name": "Penson R.", "AuthorID": "7006892163", "AffiliationID": "60029929", "AffiliationName": "Division of Hematology and Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital"}, "19737542700": {"Name": "Oza A.", "AuthorID": "19737542700", "AffiliationID": "60008768, 60016849, 60014468", "AffiliationName": "Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto"}, "7004199102": {"Name": "Korach J.", "AuthorID": "7004199102", "AffiliationID": "60005037, 60005681, 60011766", "AffiliationName": "Gynecologic Oncology Department, Sheba Medical Center, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University"}, "6603524788": {"Name": "Huzarski T.", "AuthorID": "6603524788", "AffiliationID": "60019189", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics and Pathology, Pomeranian Medical University"}, "18037515600": {"Name": "Manso L.", "AuthorID": "18037515600", "AffiliationID": "60004024", "AffiliationName": "Hospital 12 de Octubre"}, "7003737356": {"Name": "Pisano C.", "AuthorID": "7003737356", "AffiliationID": "60017517", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urogynecology, National Cancer Institute, Pascale Foundation (Scientific Institute for Research and Healthcare)"}, "55975744500": {"Name": "Kim S.I.", "AuthorID": "55975744500", "AffiliationID": "60000656", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Seoul National University College of Medicine"}, "56727018500": {"Name": "Kim J.W.", "AuthorID": "56727018500", "AffiliationID": "60000656", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Seoul National University College of Medicine"}, "57211479415": {"Name": "Lee J.Y.", "AuthorID": "57211479415", "AffiliationID": "60016728", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Institute of Women's Life Medical Science, Yonsei University College of Medicine"}, "7005656356": {"Name": "Colombo N.", "AuthorID": "7005656356", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine and Surgery, University Milan Bicocca"}, "57211875046": {"Name": "Park-Simon T.W.", "AuthorID": "57211875046", "AffiliationID": "60024052", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Medical University Hannover"}, "35354658800": {"Name": "Fujiwara K.", "AuthorID": "35354658800", "AffiliationID": "60172355", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynecologic Oncology, Saitama Medical University International Medical Center"}, "6603558506": {"Name": "Sonke G.", "AuthorID": "6603558506", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, Netherlands Cancer Institute"}, "56998909400": {"Name": "Vergote I.", "AuthorID": "56998909400", "AffiliationID": "60031069", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gynaecological Oncology, University Hospitals Leuven"}, "7005035415": {"Name": "Pujade-Lauraine E.", "AuthorID": "7005035415", "AffiliationID": "120350930", "AffiliationName": "ARCAGY-GINECO"}}}
