Specially, this nanocavity has hybrid characteristic of rectangle and disk resonator, therefore supporting both Fabry-Perot modes (FPMs) and whispering-gallery modes (WGMs). Besides, by changing the length of major and minor radius of the ellipse, the resonant wavelengths of FPMs and WGMs can be independently tuned and close to each other, thus constructing a plasmon-induced transparency - like spectrum profile. Benefitting from this, a dual-band slow light is achieved with one single resonator. Furthermore, this component can also act as a multi-band color filter and refractive index sensor. We believe such a multi-mode resonator with an ultra-small footprint will play an important role in more compact on-chip optical circuits in the future.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Fabry Perot modes", "Induced transparency", "Metal-insulator-metal waveguides", "Multimode resonators", "Optical circuits", "Refractive index sensor", "Resonant wavelengths", "Spectrum profile"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074664152", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Mathematical Physics", "MATH", "2610"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57197772732": {"Name": "Zhang Z.", "AuthorID": "57197772732", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57208189881": {"Name": "Xu H.", "AuthorID": "57208189881", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57202129877": {"Name": "Xu S.", "AuthorID": "57202129877", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, National University of Defense Technology"}, "56518336500": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "56518336500", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, National University of Defense Technology"}, "56732089500": {"Name": "Huang J.", "AuthorID": "56732089500", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57013633200": {"Name": "Chen D.", "AuthorID": "57013633200", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57210391800": {"Name": "Xie W.", "AuthorID": "57210391800", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, National University of Defense Technology"}, "16023467700": {"Name": "Yang J.", "AuthorID": "16023467700", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "Center of Material Science, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57192831289": {"Name": "Han Y.", "AuthorID": "57192831289", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "Center of Material Science, National University of Defense Technology"}, "55491491300": {"Name": "He X.", "AuthorID": "55491491300", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "Center of Material Science, National University of Defense Technology"}}}
