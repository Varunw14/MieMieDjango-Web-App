Isolation and social distancing measures, including edicts to stay at home, have been brought into place across the globe to reduce transmission of the virus, but at a huge cost to individuals and society. In addition to these measures, we urgently need effective interventions to increase adherence to behaviours that individuals in communities can enact to protect themselves and others: use of tissues to catch expelled droplets from coughs or sneezes, use of face masks as appropriate, hand-washing on all occasions when required, disinfecting objects and surfaces, physical distancing, and not touching one\u2019s eyes, nose or mouth. There is an urgent need for direct evidence to inform development of such interventions, but it is possible to make a start by applying behavioural science methods and models.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Betacoronavirus", "Coronavirus", "Coronavirus Infections", "Disease Outbreaks", "Disease Transmission, Infectious", "Hand Disinfection", "Hand Hygiene", "Health Behavior", "Humans", "Pandemics", "Pneumonia, Viral", "Quarantine", "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome", "Social Distance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084617632", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"7402396010": {"Name": "West R.", "AuthorID": "7402396010", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, Institute of Epidemiology and Healthcare, University College London"}, "7004779970": {"Name": "Michie S.", "AuthorID": "7004779970", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "7201409301": {"Name": "Rubin G.J.", "AuthorID": "7201409301", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Medicine, King\u2019s College London"}, "16549254900": {"Name": "Aml\u00f4t R.", "AuthorID": "16549254900", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Behavioural Science Team, Emergency Response Department Science and Technology (ERD S&T), Public Health England"}}}
