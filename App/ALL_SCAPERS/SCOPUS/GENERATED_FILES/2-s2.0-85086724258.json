First, we discuss the test of such hypotheses in parametric models such as linear regressions and then introduce a new command, dgmtest, for a nonparametric test proposed in Wilhelm (2018, Working Paper CWP45/18, Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice, Institute for Fiscal Studies). To illustrate the new command, we provide Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application to testing for measurement error in administrative earnings data.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dgmtest", "measurement error", "measurement error bias", "nonparametric test", "st0600"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086724258", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (miscellaneous)", "MATH", "2601"]], "AuthorData": {"57217193540": {"Name": "Lee Y.J.", "AuthorID": "57217193540", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University of Copenhagen Copenhagen"}, "57194973025": {"Name": "Wilhelm D.", "AuthorID": "57194973025", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60117041", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University College London, CeMMAP"}}}
