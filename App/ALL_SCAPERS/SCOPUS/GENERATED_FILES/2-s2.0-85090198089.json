Applied to rt-MRI data, GAMMs allow for observation of factor effects on vocal tract shape throughout two key dimensions: time (vocal tract change over the temporal course of a speech segment) and space (location of change within the vocal tract). Examples of this method are provided for rt-MRI data collected at a temporal resolution of 20 ms and a spatial resolution of 1.41 mm, for 36 native speakers of German. The rt-MRI data were quantified as 28-point semi-polar-grid aperture functions. Three test cases are provided as a way of observing vocal tract differences between: (1) /a:/ and /i:/, (2) /a:/ and /aI/, and (3) accentuated and unstressed /a:/. The results for each GAMM are independently validated using functional linear mixed models (FLMMs) constructed from data obtained at 20% and 80% of the vowel interval. In each case, the two methods yield similar results. In light of the method similarities, we propose that GAMMs are a robust, powerful, and interpretable method of simultaneously analyzing both temporal and spatial effects in rt-MRI video of speech.", "AuthorKeywords": ["FLMM", "GAMM", "Real-time MRI", "Speech dynamics", "Speech imaging"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090198089", "SubjectAreas": [["Podiatry", "HEAL", "3613"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"48461054200": {"Name": "Carignan C.", "AuthorID": "48461054200", "AffiliationID": "60107806, 60017803", "AffiliationName": "MARCS Institute for Brain, Behaviour and Development, Western Sydney University"}, "7003837987": {"Name": "Hoole P.", "AuthorID": "7003837987", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Phonetics and Speech Processing, Ludwig Maximilians Universit\u00e4t Munich"}, "55181719400": {"Name": "Kunay E.", "AuthorID": "55181719400", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Phonetics and Speech Processing, Ludwig Maximilians Universit\u00e4t Munich"}, "14018310100": {"Name": "Pouplier M.", "AuthorID": "14018310100", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Phonetics and Speech Processing, Ludwig Maximilians Universit\u00e4t Munich"}, "7202784054": {"Name": "Harrington J.", "AuthorID": "7202784054", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Phonetics and Speech Processing, Ludwig Maximilians Universit\u00e4t Munich"}, "54782771600": {"Name": "Joseph A.", "AuthorID": "54782771600", "AffiliationID": "60032895", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry"}, "10439690600": {"Name": "Voit D.", "AuthorID": "10439690600", "AffiliationID": "60032895", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry"}, "57202484435": {"Name": "Frahm J.", "AuthorID": "57202484435", "AffiliationID": "60032895", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry"}}}
