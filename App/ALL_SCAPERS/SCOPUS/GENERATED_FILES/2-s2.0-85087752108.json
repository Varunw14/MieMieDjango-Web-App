Several studies have proposed circulating and tissue biomarkers, but none of them has been validated to monitor acute and long-term drug response. We previously described how the myostatin (MSTN) level is naturally downregulated in several neuromuscular diseases, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Here, we show that the dystrophin-deficient Golden Retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) dog model also presents an intrinsic loss of Mstn production in muscle. The abnormally low levels of Mstn observed in the GRMD dog puppies at 2 months were partially rescued at both mRNA and protein level after adeno-associated virus (AAV)-microdystrophin treatment in a dose-dependent manner. These results show that circulating Mstn is a robust and reliable quantitative biomarker, capable of measuring a therapeutic response to pharmaco-gene therapy in real time in the neuromuscular system, as well as a quantitative means for non-invasive follow-up of a therapeutic effect. Moreover, a 2-year follow-up also suggests that Mstn could be a longitudinal monitoring tool to follow maintenance or decrease of the therapeutic effect.\u00a9 2020 The AuthorsDuchenne muscular dystrophy is a severe muscle disease, and recently, several treatments have emerged highlighting the need for a blood-based biomarker. Here, Dumonceaux and colleagues demonstrated that myostatin, an inhibitor of muscle growth secreted by skeletal muscles, is a reliable and quantitative biomarker for short- and long-term monitoring of therapy effects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biomarker", "clinical trials", "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)", "GDF8", "myostatin", "neuromuscular disorders", "therapy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087752108", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"6507639974": {"Name": "Mariot V.", "AuthorID": "6507639974", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, University College London, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, and Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Trust"}, "57192692127": {"Name": "Torelli S.", "AuthorID": "57192692127", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, 30 Guildford Street"}, "35601353000": {"Name": "Morgan J.", "AuthorID": "35601353000", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, 30 Guildford Street"}, "7102038246": {"Name": "Muntoni F.", "AuthorID": "7102038246", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, 30 Guildford Street"}, "55669992000": {"Name": "Voit T.", "AuthorID": "55669992000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, University College London, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, and Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Trust"}, "6506439253": {"Name": "Dumonceaux J.", "AuthorID": "6506439253", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, University College London, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, and Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Trust"}, "6602789801": {"Name": "Le Guiner C.", "AuthorID": "6602789801", "AffiliationID": "60032006, 60105668, 60028048, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM UMR 1089, Universit\u00e9 de Nantes, CHU de Nantes, IRS2 Nantes Biotech, 22"}, "16505970300": {"Name": "Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my I.", "AuthorID": "16505970300", "AffiliationID": "60008236, 60025066, 60106700, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "U955-IMRB, Team 10, Biology of the Neuromuscular System, INSERM, UPEC, EFS, Ecole Nationale V\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire d'Alfort"}, "57211255942": {"Name": "Blot S.", "AuthorID": "57211255942", "AffiliationID": "60008236, 60025066, 60106700, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "U955-IMRB, Team 10, Biology of the Neuromuscular System, INSERM, UPEC, EFS, Ecole Nationale V\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire d'Alfort"}, "24448566800": {"Name": "Montus M.", "AuthorID": "24448566800", "AffiliationID": "60006105", "AffiliationName": "G\u00e9n\u00e9thon, 1 bis rue de l'Internationale"}}}
