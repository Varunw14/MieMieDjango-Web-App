Re-use permitted under CC BY. Published by BMJ.Background To investigate differences in psychiatric care use over time between Swedish born and those born abroad who migrate to Sweden. Methods Population-based cohort study analysing linked population and health registers, following individuals born 1944-1990 from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2016. Time-stratified survival analysis using Cox regression estimated time to psychiatric care use. Population included 5 150 753 individuals with 78.1% Swedish born. Migrant status was coded as Swedish born or migrant. Migrants were grouped by year of immigration and region of origin. The main outcome: psychiatric care use, defined as any psychiatric care; psychiatric inpatient or outpatient care; or use of psychotropics. Results Migrants arriving before 2005 had a higher use of any psychiatric care relative to Swedish born but migrants arriving 2005 onwards had lower use. Migrants from sub-Saharan Africa and Asia had a lower use of any psychiatric care during the first decade in Sweden whereas migrants from Middle East and North Africa had a higher use, driven by use of psychotropics. Conclusions The lower use of psychiatric care during the first decade contrasts with higher use among migrants with a longer duration of stay. Psychiatric care use among migrants should be analysed multi-dimensionally, taking duration of stay, region of origin and type of care into account.", "AuthorKeywords": ["epidemiology", "mental health & psychiatry"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092312239", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"23394868300": {"Name": "Hollander A.C.", "AuthorID": "23394868300", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Global Public Health Sciences, Karolinska Institutet"}, "57204790417": {"Name": "MacKay E.", "AuthorID": "57204790417", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Global Public Health Sciences, Karolinska Institutet"}, "57194173847": {"Name": "Sj\u00f6qvist H.", "AuthorID": "57194173847", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Global Public Health Sciences, Karolinska Institutet"}, "6701846593": {"Name": "Dalman C.", "AuthorID": "6701846593", "AffiliationID": "113414145", "AffiliationName": "Centrum f\u00f6r Epidemiologi Och Samh\u00e4llsmedicin"}, "57218240440": {"Name": "Kirkbride J.B.", "AuthorID": "57218240440", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, Faculty of Brain Sciences, Ucl"}, "6603631609": {"Name": "B\u00e4\u00e4rnhielm S.", "AuthorID": "6603631609", "AffiliationID": "123758585", "AffiliationName": "Transkulturellt Centrum"}}}
