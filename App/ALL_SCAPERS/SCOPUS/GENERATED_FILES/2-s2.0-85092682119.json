Albumin microbubbles coated in the drug-laden oil layer were synthesized using a new method of connecting two microfluidic T-mixers in series. Double-layered microbubbles thus produced consist of an innermost core of nitrogen gas encapsulated in an aqueous layer of bovine serum albumin (BSA) which in turn, is coated with an outer layer of silicone oil. In order to identify the process conditions leading to the formation of double-layered microbubbles, a regime map was constructed based on capillary numbers for aqueous and oil phases. The microbubble formation regime transitions from double-layered to single layer microbubbles and then to formation of single oil droplets upon gradual change in flow rates of aqueous and oil phases. In vitro dissolution studies of double-layered microbubbles in an air-saturated environment indicated that a complete dissolution of such bubbles produces an oil droplet devoid of a gas bubble. Incorporation of doxorubicin and curcumin was found to produce a synergistic effect, which resulted in higher cell deaths in 2D monolayers of TNBC cells and inhibition of cell proliferation from 3D spheroid models of TNBC cells compared to the control.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bovine serum albumins", "Capillary numbers", "Complete dissolution", "In-vitro dissolution", "Microfluidic T junctions", "Process condition", "Synergistic effect", "Triple-negative breast cancers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092682119", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Surfaces and Interfaces", "PHYS", "3110"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"], ["Electrochemistry", "CHEM", "1603"]], "AuthorData": {"8711689000": {"Name": "Dalvi S.V.", "AuthorID": "8711689000", "AffiliationID": "60104341", "AffiliationName": "Chemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar"}, "57215428436": {"Name": "Khan A.H.", "AuthorID": "57215428436", "AffiliationID": "60104341", "AffiliationName": "Chemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar"}, "57219428949": {"Name": "Surwase S.", "AuthorID": "57219428949", "AffiliationID": "60104341", "AffiliationName": "Chemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar"}, "57202195637": {"Name": "Jiang X.", "AuthorID": "57202195637", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "57200420958": {"Name": "Ahmed J.", "AuthorID": "57200420958", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "57219428705": {"Name": "Wu B.", "AuthorID": "57219428705", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "7006247915": {"Name": "Edirisinghe M.", "AuthorID": "7006247915", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "56598063500": {"Name": "Gultekinoglu M.", "AuthorID": "56598063500", "AffiliationID": "60020484", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Bioengineering Division, Institute for Graduate Studies in Science and Engineering, Hacettepe University"}, "6603354213": {"Name": "Ulubayram K.", "AuthorID": "6603354213", "AffiliationID": "60020484", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Bioengineering Division, Institute for Graduate Studies in Science and Engineering, Hacettepe University"}, "24334063400": {"Name": "Bayram C.", "AuthorID": "24334063400", "AffiliationID": "60020484", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Department of Nanotechnology and Nanomedicine, Hacettepe University"}, "57194763062": {"Name": "Sathisaran I.", "AuthorID": "57194763062", "AffiliationID": "60104341", "AffiliationName": "Biological Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar"}, "35110944100": {"Name": "Bhatia D.", "AuthorID": "35110944100", "AffiliationID": "60104341", "AffiliationName": "Biological Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar"}}}
