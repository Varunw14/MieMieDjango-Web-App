It is widely used in the assessment of lung function to provide objective information used in the diagnosis of lung diseases and monitoring lung health. In 2005, the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society jointly adopted technical standards for conducting spirometry. Improvements in instrumentation and computational capabilities, together with new research studies and enhanced quality assurance approaches, have led to the need to update the 2005 technical standards for spirometry to take full advantage of current technical capabilities. Methods: This spirometry technical standards document was developed by an international joint task force, appointed by the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society, with expertise in conducting and analyzing pulmonary function tests, laboratory quality assurance, and developing international standards. A comprehensive review of published evidence was performed. A patient survey was developed to capture patients' experiences. Results: Revisions to the 2005 technical standards for spirometry were made, including the addition of factors that were not previously considered. Evidence to support the revisions was cited when applicable. The experience and expertise of task force members were used to develop recommended best practices. Conclusions: Standards and consensus recommendations are presented for manufacturers, clinicians, operators, and researchers with the aims of increasing the accuracy, precision, and quality of spirometric measurements and improving the patient experience. A comprehensive guide to aid in the implementation of these standards was developed as an online supplement.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Pulmonary function", "Spirometer", "Spirometry", "Technical standards"], "IndexKeywords": ["Advisory Committees", "Europe", "Humans", "Lung Diseases", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Respiratory Function Tests", "Societies, Medical", "Spirometry", "United States"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073178954", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"]], "AuthorData": {"57209738955": {"Name": "Graham B.L.", "AuthorID": "57209738955", "AffiliationID": "60011553", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory Research Centre, Division of Respirology, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, University of Saskatchewan"}, "16835573200": {"Name": "Steenbruggen I.", "AuthorID": "16835573200", "AffiliationID": "60004078", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pulmonology, Isala Hospital"}, "14718862000": {"Name": "Barjaktarevic I.Z.", "AuthorID": "14718862000", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles"}, "7401623733": {"Name": "Cooper B.G.", "AuthorID": "7401623733", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7402065421": {"Name": "Hall G.L.", "AuthorID": "7402065421", "AffiliationID": "60031226, 60090173", "AffiliationName": "School of Physiotherapy and Exercise Science, Faculty of Health Science, Curtin University"}, "6603197136": {"Name": "Hallstrand T.S.", "AuthorID": "6603197136", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Washington"}, "7006158871": {"Name": "Kaminsky D.A.", "AuthorID": "7006158871", "AffiliationID": "60009500", "AffiliationName": "Pulmonary Disease and Critical Care Medicine, University of Vermont Larner College of Medicine"}, "35292810500": {"Name": "McCarthy K.", "AuthorID": "35292810500", "AffiliationID": "110295727", "AffiliationName": "ERT Inc."}, "16309962100": {"Name": "McCormack M.C.", "AuthorID": "16309962100", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Pulmonary Function Laboratory, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Johns Hopkins University"}, "55740671800": {"Name": "Miller M.R.", "AuthorID": "55740671800", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham"}, "57211260343": {"Name": "Oropez C.E.", "AuthorID": "57211260343", "AffiliationID": "60010065", "AffiliationName": "Pulmonary Function and Exercise Physiology Laboratory, Department of Medicine, University of Arizona"}, "7202949614": {"Name": "Rosenfeld M.", "AuthorID": "7202949614", "AffiliationID": "60028548", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pulmonary and Sleep Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington School of Medicine"}, "22636433100": {"Name": "Stanojevic S.", "AuthorID": "22636433100", "AffiliationID": "60030319", "AffiliationName": "Translational Medicine, Hospital for Sick Children"}, "6507768012": {"Name": "Swanney M.P.", "AuthorID": "6507768012", "AffiliationID": "60004823", "AffiliationName": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, Canterbury District Health Board"}, "55920856100": {"Name": "Thompson B.R.", "AuthorID": "55920856100", "AffiliationID": "60030804, 60008014", "AffiliationName": "Physiology Service, Department of Respiratory Medicine, Alfred Hospital, School of Health Sciences, Swinburne University of Technology"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
