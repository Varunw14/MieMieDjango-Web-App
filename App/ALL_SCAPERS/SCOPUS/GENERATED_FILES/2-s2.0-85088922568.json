The present work combines a set of numerical methods to simulate the ship-wave-ice interaction in such ice conditions. Particularly, Computational Fluid Dynamics is applied to provide fluid solutions for the floes and it is incorporated with the Discrete Element Method to govern ice motions and account for ship-ice/ice-ice collisions, by which, the proposed approach innovatively includes ship-generated waves in the interaction. In addition, this work provides two algorithms that can implement computational models with natural ice-floe fields, which takes floe size distribution and randomness into consideration thus achieving high-fidelity modelling of the problem. Following validation against experiments, the model is shown accurate in predicting the ice-floe resistance of a ship, and then a series of simulations are performed to investigate how the resistance is influenced by ship speed, ice concentration, ice thickness and floe diameter. This paper presents a useful approach that can provide power estimates for Arctic shipping and has the potential to facilitate other polar engineering purposes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Arctic shipping", "Computational fluid dynamics", "Discrete element method", "Ice floe", "Ship resistance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Arctic shipping", "Computational model", "Fluid solutions", "Ice concentration", "Ice interactions", "Ship performance", "Ship resistances", "Validation against experiments"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088922568", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"57205472132": {"Name": "Huang L.", "AuthorID": "57205472132", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "56941815700": {"Name": "Igrec B.", "AuthorID": "56941815700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "16234762600": {"Name": "Stagonas D.", "AuthorID": "16234762600", "AffiliationID": "60004407", "AffiliationName": "Department of Offshore Process and Energy Engineering, Cranfield University"}, "25925551300": {"Name": "Thomas G.", "AuthorID": "25925551300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "6603338395": {"Name": "Tuhkuri J.", "AuthorID": "6603338395", "AffiliationID": "60103653", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Aalto University"}, "57208500349": {"Name": "Li M.", "AuthorID": "57208500349", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanics and Maritime Science, Chalmers University of Technology"}, "6602892883": {"Name": "Toffoli A.", "AuthorID": "6602892883", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infrastructure Engineering, University of Melbourne"}, "55164687500": {"Name": "Cardiff P.", "AuthorID": "55164687500", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, University College Dublin"}}}
