We consider implementations with both position-independent and position-dependent integration times. In the former case, we find that the conditions for geometric ergodicity are essentially a gradient of the log-density which asymptotically points towards the centre of the space and grows no faster than linearly. In an idealised scenario in which the integration time is allowed to change in different regions of the space, we show that geometric ergodicity can be recovered for a much broader class of tail behaviours, leading to some guidelines for the choice of this free parameter in practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Geometric ergodicity", "Hamiltonian dynamics", "Hamiltonian Monte Carlo", "Hybrid Monte Carlo", "Markov chain Monte Carlo", "Markov chains", "Stochastic simulation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072333821", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"]], "AuthorData": {"56119150700": {"Name": "Livingstone S.", "AuthorID": "56119150700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College"}, "55849165900": {"Name": "Byrne S.", "AuthorID": "55849165900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College"}, "55151893300": {"Name": "Betancourt M.", "AuthorID": "55151893300", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, University of Warwick"}, "7005215170": {"Name": "Girolami M.", "AuthorID": "7005215170", "AffiliationID": "60111768, 60100056", "AffiliationName": "Alan Turing Institute, British Library"}}}
