We aimed to perform comprehensive long term follow up of adults who had been treated with GT for EA as children. Methods: Consecutive patients who underwent GT for EA in childhood aged > 18 years old were identified alongside age matched patients who had primary repair (PR). Type of EA, comorbidities and details of surgery were recorded. Telephone interviews included medical history, current symptoms \u2014 including gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS), morbidity and health related quality of life (HRQoL) using gastrointestinal quality of life index (GIQLI). Results: 32 participants were interviewed in each group (mean age 29 years). BMI (19.9 \u00b1 3.5) was significantly lower (p = 0.0006) in GT group. 6/32 (19%) still required supplementary feeding. Adult morbidity included anastomotic stricture (34%), chronic respiratory disease (28%), dumping symptoms (25%), anemia (47%) and depression (19%). 3 patients required major revision surgery. Participants in both groups report regular upper gastrointestinal symptoms (GSRS: GT = 2.1, PR = 2.0) and were more symptomatic than the normal population (1.4) but not statistically different from each other. HRQoL (GIQLI = 113) was lower than after PR (122) but not significantly different (p = 0.29) and the normal population (125). 23% of GT participants had higher than normal HRQoL. Conclusions: GT for EA is associated with significant morbidity and symptoms, including issues previously unreported in adulthood such as mental health problems. This mandates long term follow up and quality transition of these patients into adult care. Type of study: Retrospective study.
