Using information for multiple domains or across prediction tasks has the potential to improve the performance of predictive modeling. However, aggregating data often leads to incomplete data matrices that might be limiting for modeling. In line with previous studies, we show that by generating predicted bioactivity profiles, and using these as additional features, prediction accuracy of biological endpoints can be improved. Using conformal prediction, a type of confidence predictor, we present a robust framework for the calculation of these profiles and the evaluation of their impact. We report on the outcomes from several approaches to generate the predicted profiles on 16 datasets in cytotoxicity and bioactivity and show that efficiency is improved the most when including the p-values from conformal prediction as bioactivity profiles.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Conformal predictions", "Drug development", "Incomplete data", "Multiple domains", "P-values", "Prediction accuracy", "Prediction tasks", "Predictive modeling"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086792719", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Library and Information Sciences", "SOCI", "3309"]], "AuthorData": {"57200703759": {"Name": "Norinder U.", "AuthorID": "57200703759", "AffiliationID": "60008141", "AffiliationName": "Mtm Research Centre, School of Science and Technology, \u00d6rebro University"}, "12808508000": {"Name": "Spjuth O.", "AuthorID": "12808508000", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University"}, "6603427180": {"Name": "Svensson F.", "AuthorID": "6603427180", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer's Research, UK University, College London, Drug Discovery Institute"}}}
