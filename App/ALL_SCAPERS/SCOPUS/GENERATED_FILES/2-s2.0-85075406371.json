[It is not recommended for non-smokers.]\u201d) and a comparative harm message (\u201cUse of this product is much less harmful than smoking\u201d [COMP]) on smokers\u2019 and non-smokers\u2019 perceptions and behavioural intentions. Methods: 2495 UK residents (1283 smokers and 1212 non-smokers) self-reported perceived harm, addictiveness, EC effectiveness, social acceptability, and intentions to purchase and use EC, and in smokers, intentions to quit and intentions to use EC in future quit attempts. These were measured before and after exposure to EC images containing either the TPD, COMP, TPD + COMP or no message. Results: Non-smokers had higher harm, addictiveness and lower social acceptability perceptions. TPD presence increased, whilst COMP decreased, harm and addictiveness perceptions in both groups. For smokers only, harm perceptions were lower following exposure to COMP alone vs. no message. For non-smokers the TPD increased harm perceptions vs. no message. There were no effects on social acceptability, EC effectiveness or use intentions. In smokers only, purchase and quit intentions were higher following exposure to the COMP alone. Conclusion: TPD messages may be effective smoking prevention tools, although the COMP message was more effective in reducing harm perceptions and increasing use intentions in smokers. That COMP did not increase use intentions in non-smokers suggest that such exposures may potentially act as an effective harm reduction tool without resulting in increased uptake among non-smokers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electronic cigarettes", "Health messages", "Quit intentions", "Risk Perceptions", "Tobacco products directive", "Warning labels"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems", "European Union", "Female", "Harm Reduction", "Health Communication", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Health Risk Behaviors", "Humans", "Intention", "Internet", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Non-Smokers", "Product Labeling", "Smokers", "Tobacco Use Disorder", "United Kingdom", "Vaping", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075406371", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Toxicology", "PHAR", "3005"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56463798700": {"Name": "Kimber C.", "AuthorID": "56463798700", "AffiliationID": "60031237", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Addictive Behaviours Research, Division of Psychology, School of Applied Sciences"}, "14008980700": {"Name": "Frings D.", "AuthorID": "14008980700", "AffiliationID": "60031237", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Addictive Behaviours Research, Division of Psychology, School of Applied Sciences"}, "57191226819": {"Name": "Cox S.", "AuthorID": "57191226819", "AffiliationID": "60031237", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Addictive Behaviours Research, Division of Psychology, School of Applied Sciences"}, "6603886210": {"Name": "Albery I.P.", "AuthorID": "6603886210", "AffiliationID": "60031237", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Addictive Behaviours Research, Division of Psychology, School of Applied Sciences"}, "6506951935": {"Name": "Dawkins L.", "AuthorID": "6506951935", "AffiliationID": "60031237", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Addictive Behaviours Research, Division of Psychology, School of Applied Sciences"}}}
