Many of the responses described recognise both recipient and donor moieties of the target antigen and thus represent auto-, rather than allo-immunity. Within this rapidly evolving field, many questions remain unanswered: what triggers the response; how innate and adaptive humoral autoimmunity integrate; and most pressingly, how autoimmunity contributes to graft damage and its relationship to other effector mechanisms of graft rejection. This review summarises recent clinical and experimental studies of humoral autoimmunity in transplant rejection, and considers some of the answers to these questions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Allograft vasculopathy", "Autoimmunity", "Chronic rejection", "Germinal centre", "Natural antibody"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptive Immunity", "Animals", "Autoantibodies", "Autoantigens", "Autoimmunity", "Graft Rejection", "Humans", "Immunity, Humoral", "Immunity, Innate", "Organ Transplantation", "Transplantation, Homologous"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086441198", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"57203961034": {"Name": "Siu J.H.Y.", "AuthorID": "57203961034", "AffiliationID": "60025649, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, School of Clinical Medicine"}, "7005604033": {"Name": "Pettigrew G.J.", "AuthorID": "7005604033", "AffiliationID": "60025649, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, School of Clinical Medicine"}, "6507494664": {"Name": "Motallebzadeh R.", "AuthorID": "6507494664", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Surgical Biotechnology, Institute of Immunity & Transplantation, Department of Renal Medicine, University College London"}}}
