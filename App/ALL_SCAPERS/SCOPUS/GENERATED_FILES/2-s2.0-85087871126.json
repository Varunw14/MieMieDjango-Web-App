This paper applies a social justice framework (4Rs) in analysing a Business Development (BD) programme that was implemented as part of Sierra Leone\u2019s Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) strategy to promote entrepreneurship development and reduce unemployment among youth. Despite the BD programme\u2019s initial strengths, to recognize youth's heterogeneity with the aim to address some of the root causes of the war, we show how the programme struggled to counter social inequality, unemployment and neopatrimonialism. Sudden decreases in donor funding led to severe modifications of redistribution processes, thereby hampering youth's representation. This raises questions about the design of TVET strategies and BD programmes in post-conflict settings in general. Our paper further showcases how the resurfacing of the root causes of a conflict in the scope of small-scheme development programmes, can have far-reaching effects on young people\u2019s various relationships of trust, if not reconciliation process as a whole.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Business development programmes", "peacebuilding", "post-conflict Sierra Leone", "TVET"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087871126", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"57218102355": {"Name": "van der Veen R.", "AuthorID": "57218102355", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "56786355800": {"Name": "Datzberger S.", "AuthorID": "56786355800", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Education and International Development, UCL Institute of Education"}}}
