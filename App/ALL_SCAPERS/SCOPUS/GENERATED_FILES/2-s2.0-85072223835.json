Each of these issues may be used either to support or to criticize human space missions. We conclude that while these issues are complex and context-dependent, there appear to be no overwhelming obstacles such as cost effectiveness, threats to human life or protection of pristine space objects, to sending humans to space and to colonize space. The article argues for the rationality of the idea of a space refuge and the defensibility of the idea of human enhancement applied to future deep-space astronauts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bioethics", "Future studies", "Gene editing", "Human enhancement", "Human mission to Mars", "Space ethics", "Space refuge"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072223835", "SubjectAreas": [["Issues, Ethics and Legal Aspects", "NURS", "2910"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"57188744573": {"Name": "Szocik K.", "AuthorID": "57188744573", "AffiliationID": "60085627", "AffiliationName": "University of Information Technology and Management in Rzeszow"}, "57210994642": {"Name": "Norman Z.", "AuthorID": "57210994642", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "7202205455": {"Name": "Reiss M.J.", "AuthorID": "7202205455", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}}}
