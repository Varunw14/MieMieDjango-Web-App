Linear morphoea is more prevalent in paediatric patients, and knowledge of disease in adults is limited. The objective of this study was to compare paediatric- and adult-onset linear morphoea, in an exclusively adult population. Methodology: This was a retrospective cohort study of adult patients with linear morphoea seen over a 3-year period at a single-site adult tertiary-referral Connective Tissue Disease centre. Clinical markers of disease severity and course, including anatomical distribution, extracutaneous manifestations, cutaneous symptoms, associated autoimmunity, inflammatory blood parameters, Dermatology Life Quality Index scores, treatment requirements and modified Localised Scleroderma Activity Tool were assessed and compared in paediatric- and adult-onset linear morphoea. Results: Of 298 patients with morphoea seen during the study period, 135 had linear morphoea and 133 were included in the study. Most were female (78.9%), the mean age was 36.5 years and almost half (43.6%) had adult-onset disease. Disease was similarly severe between groups with regard to anatomical distribution, cutaneous symptoms (n = 89, 66.9%), extracutaneous manifestations (n = 76, 57.1%), antinuclear antibody\u2013positivity (n = 40, 40.4%), raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (n = 27, 25.0%) and associated autoimmune diagnoses (n = 15, 11.3%). Prescribed treatments were similar between groups; 73.7% receiving methotrexate and almost one-third (32.3%) requiring more than one steroid-sparing agent. Those with paediatric-onset had more disease-related damage, with a mean modified Localised Scleroderma Skin Damage Index score of 19.5 (95% confidence interval: 17.0\u201322.0) versus 8.1 (95% confidence interval: 4.4\u201311.8; p < 0.001). Significantly more patients with adult-onset linear morphoea had quiescent disease (p = 0.0332), and even after correcting for disease duration, paediatric-onset patients still had 2.6 times greater odds of active disease (odds ratio = 2.59, 95% confidence interval: 0.9\u20137.6; p = 0.083). Conclusion: Linear morphoea in adults can be a severe disease with extracutaneous, autoimmune and systemic features. Adults with paediatric-onset disease appear to have more severe cumulative damage, greater functional impairment and ongoing disease activity. This patient subgroup may require particularly close monitoring and more aggressive therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adult morphoea", "disease severity", "linear scleroderma", "Localised scleroderma", "morphoea"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086330729", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"22635467100": {"Name": "Saracino A.M.", "AuthorID": "22635467100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "16024754700": {"Name": "Nihtyanova S.I.", "AuthorID": "16024754700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "7006031021": {"Name": "Denton C.P.", "AuthorID": "7006031021", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "57217116545": {"Name": "George C.", "AuthorID": "57217116545", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
