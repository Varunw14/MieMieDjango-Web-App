In particular, we show that the test asymptotically controls size at a polynomial rate, is nonconservative, and detects certain smooth local alternatives that converge to the null with the fastest possible rate. Our test is based on a data-driven bandwidth value and the critical value for the test takes this randomness into account. Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the test performs well in finite samples. In particular, the simulations show that the test controls size and, under some alternatives, is significantly more powerful than existing procedures.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089010007", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"55995253400": {"Name": "Chetverikov D.", "AuthorID": "55995253400", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "University of California at Los Angeles"}, "57194973025": {"Name": "Wilhelm D.", "AuthorID": "57194973025", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57205207510": {"Name": "Kim D.", "AuthorID": "57205207510", "AffiliationID": "60018491", "AffiliationName": "Simon Fraser University"}}}
