MCDM methods are common in other contexts, and have been used to address issues particular to design, organisation and management of large-scale construction and engineering projects. They are, however, novel in the context of cultural heritage. This paper will examine the potentials of non-contact sensor technologies (including photogrammetry via Structure from Motion, structured light scanning and terrestrial laser scanning) to record, model and archive the stones and their inscriptions. The various methodologies will be assessed against set criteria, specifically speed, resolution, readability and scalability for mass recording, from MCDM including criteria given by humanities scholars in the field of history, theology and Jewish studies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cultural heritages", "Engineering project", "Feasibility studies", "Multi criteria decision making", "Non- contact sensors", "Structure from motion", "Structured light scanning", "Terrestrial laser scanning"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091088094", "SubjectAreas": [["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"]], "AuthorData": {"57193324346": {"Name": "Pavlovskis M.", "AuthorID": "57193324346", "AffiliationID": "60077981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Construction Technology and Management, Faculty of Civil Engineering, Vilnius Gediminas Technical University"}, "57190342030": {"Name": "Chizhova M.", "AuthorID": "57190342030", "AffiliationID": "60011372", "AffiliationName": "University of Bamberg, Institute of Archaeology, Heritage Sciences and Art History"}, "56539793300": {"Name": "Hindmarch J.", "AuthorID": "56539793300", "AffiliationID": "60011372", "AffiliationName": "University of Bamberg, Institute of Archaeology, Heritage Sciences and Art History"}, "38861761200": {"Name": "Hess M.", "AuthorID": "38861761200", "AffiliationID": "60011372", "AffiliationName": "University of Bamberg, Institute of Archaeology, Heritage Sciences and Art History"}}}
