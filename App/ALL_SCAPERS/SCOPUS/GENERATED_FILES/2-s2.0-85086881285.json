Design and methods: This was a retrospective, single-centre, non-randomized interventional cohort analysis. Data from treatment-naive patients with nAMD funded for treatment with intravitreal aflibercept in the period between 1 September 2013 and 28 February 2014 and who finished 4-year follow-up entered the analysis. Epidemiological data, visual acuity (VA) measured on ETDRS charts and injection numbers were recorded. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) data including presence or absence of macular fluid and automated central subfield macular thickness (CSMT) at year 1, 2, 3 and 4 were also recorded. Results: Ninety-four eyes of 89 patients finished 4-year follow-up. The mean number of aflibercept injections received over 4 years was 19.3. At baseline, the mean VA (SD) (Snellen) was 54.1 \u00b1 15.5 (20/100) ETDRS letters whilst the mean CSM (SD) was 296 \u00b1 81 \u00b5m. At 4 years, the mean VA (SD) (Snellen) was 60.4 \u00b1 20.0 (20/63) ETDRS letters (p < 0.0001). Mean CSMT (SD) was 218 \u00b1 79 \u03bcm (p < 0.0001). Thirty-three percent of eyes gained \u2a7e15 ETDRS letters at end of 4 years, and 66 (70%) eyes had no macular fluid at the end of the follow-up. Conclusion and relevance: The results suggest that good long-term morphological and functional treatment outcomes can be achieved using intravitreal aflibercept for nAMD in a real-life clinical setting.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Age-related macular degeneration", "genetics", "molecular", "pharmacology", "retina", "retina \u2013 medical therapies", "retinal pathology/research"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086881285", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"57209482577": {"Name": "Lukic M.", "AuthorID": "57209482577", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "35740211000": {"Name": "Eleftheriadou M.", "AuthorID": "35740211000", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "35795310300": {"Name": "Hamilton R.D.", "AuthorID": "35795310300", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "8417872600": {"Name": "Rajendram R.", "AuthorID": "8417872600", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7401717575": {"Name": "Patel P.J.", "AuthorID": "7401717575", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "23974453800": {"Name": "Bucan K.", "AuthorID": "23974453800", "AffiliationID": "60087149", "AffiliationName": "Ophthalmology Department, University Hospital Centre Split"}}}
