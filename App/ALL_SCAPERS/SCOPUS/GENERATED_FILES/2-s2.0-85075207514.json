People from ethnic minority backgrounds have longer patient intervals following identification of cancer symptoms. This study quantified ethnic differences in barriers to symptomatic presentation including culturally specific barriers. Correlates of barriers (eg, migration status, health literacy, and fatalism) were also explored. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 720 White British, Caribbean, African, Indian, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi women aged 30 to 60 (n = 120/group) was carried out in England. Barrier items were taken from the widely used cancer awareness measure; additional culturally specific barriers to symptomatic presentation were included following qualitative work (11 barriers in total). Migration status, health literacy, and fatalism were included as correlates to help-seeking barriers. Results: Ethnic minority women reported a higher number of barriers (P <.001, 2.6-3.8 more than White British women). Emotional barriers were particularly prominent. Women from ethnic minority groups were more likely to report \u201cpraying about a symptom\u201d (P <.001, except Bangladeshi women) and \u201cusing traditional remedies\u201d (P <.001, except Caribbean women). Among ethnic minority women, adult migration to the United Kingdom, low health literacy, and high fatalistic beliefs increased likelihood of reporting barriers to symptomatic presentation. For example, women who migrated as adults were more likely to be embarrassed (OR = 1.83; CI, 1.06-3.15), worry what the GP might find (OR = 1.91; CI, 1.12-3.26), and be low on body vigilance (OR = 4.44; CI, 2.72-7.23). Conclusions: Campaigns addressing barriers to symptomatic presentation among ethnic minority women should be designed to reach low health literacy populations and include messages challenging fatalistic views. These would be valuable for reducing ethnic inequalities in cancer outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["barriers", "cancer", "early diagnosis", "ethnicity", "general practice", "symptomatic presentation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "England", "Ethnic Groups", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Minority Groups", "Neoplasms", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Primary Health Care"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075207514", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57210528179": {"Name": "Williams E.D.", "AuthorID": "57210528179", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Sciences, University of Surrey"}, "24167321100": {"Name": "Whitaker K.L.", "AuthorID": "24167321100", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Sciences, University of Surrey"}, "51665524100": {"Name": "Piano M.", "AuthorID": "51665524100", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Sciences, University of Surrey"}, "6508131110": {"Name": "Marlow L.A.V.", "AuthorID": "6508131110", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, King's College London, Guy's Hospital"}}}
