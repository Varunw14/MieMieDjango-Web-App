Published by BMJ.Objective To determine trends in emergency admission rates requiring different levels of critical care in hospitals with and without a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Design Birth cohort study created from Hospital Episode Statistics. Setting National Health Service funded hospitals in England. Patients 8 577 680 singleton children born between 1 May 2003 and 31 April 2017. Outcome measures Using procedure and diagnostic codes, we assigned indicators of high dependency care (eg, non-invasive ventilation) or intensive care (eg, invasive ventilation) to emergency admissions. Interventions Children were followed up until their fifth birthday to estimate high dependency and intensive care admission rates in hospitals with and without a PICU. We tested the yearly trend of high dependency and intensive care admissions to hospitals without a PICU using logistic regression models. Results Emergency admissions requiring high dependency care in hospitals without a PICU increased from 3.30 (95% CI 3.09 to 3.51) per 10 000 child-years in 2008/2009 to 7.58 (95% CI 7.28 to 7.89) in 2016/2017 and overtook hospitals with a PICU in 2015/2016. The odds of an admission requiring high dependency care to a hospital without a PICU compared with a hospital with a PICU increased by 9% per study year (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.10). The same trend was not present for admissions requiring intensive care (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.03). Conclusions Between 2008/2009 and 2016/2017, an increasing proportion of admissions with indicators of high dependency care took place in hospitals without a PICU.", "AuthorKeywords": ["epidemiology", "intensive care"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Child, Preschool", "Critical Care", "Critical Illness", "Emergency Medical Services", "England", "Female", "Hospitals", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Intensive Care Units", "Intensive Care Units, Pediatric", "Logistic Models", "Male"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085315524", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"57195721188": {"Name": "Lewis K.M.", "AuthorID": "57195721188", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice Research and Teaching Department, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London Institute of Child Health"}, "57201886761": {"Name": "Parekh S.M.", "AuthorID": "57201886761", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Children and Families Policy Research Unit, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7401932225": {"Name": "Gilbert R.", "AuthorID": "7401932225", "AffiliationID": "121377269", "AffiliationName": "Health Data Research UK"}, "23099718100": {"Name": "Hardelid P.", "AuthorID": "23099718100", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice Research and Teaching Department, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London Institute of Child Health"}, "37109070100": {"Name": "Wijlaars L.", "AuthorID": "37109070100", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Children and Families Policy Research Unit, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "6602350620": {"Name": "Ramnarayan P.", "AuthorID": "6602350620", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Children's Acute Transport Service, Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
