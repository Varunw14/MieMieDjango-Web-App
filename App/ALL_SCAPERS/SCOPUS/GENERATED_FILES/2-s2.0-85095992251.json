Work done in the UK by numerous personnel over many years has been instrumental in developing novel risk stratifications, evaluating treatment strategies for adult patients with de novo and relapsed disease and in making novel scientific contributions. The UK has championed and achieved very high levels of recruitment to clinical trials and, in particular, is known for success in large, investigator-initiated randomised controlled trials. This historical review charts the progress of clinical research in adult ALL from its inception to the present day.", "AuthorKeywords": ["acute lymphoblastic leukaemia", "adult", "TRIALS"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095992251", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"7102396522": {"Name": "Fielding A.K.", "AuthorID": "7102396522", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL) Cancer Institute"}, "35373669600": {"Name": "Goldstone A.H.", "AuthorID": "35373669600", "AffiliationID": "60111687", "AffiliationName": "HCA Healthcare, Macmillan Cancer Centre"}}}
