Here, different types of MXene nanosheets are combined to create flexible all-MXene hybrid films with high gravimetric capacitance and excellent rate performance for flexible supercapacitors. Ti3C2Tx nanosheets are introduced in between Nb2CTx layers, leading to a significantly increased interlayer spacing. The self-restacking of both types of MXene nanosheets is effectively impeded, accelerating the diffusion of electrolyte ions and enabling more accessible 2D nanochannels. The freestanding Ti3C2Tx/Nb2CTx films deliver a high gravimetric capacitance of 370 F g-1 at a scan rate of 2 mV s-1, good rate performance with 56.1% capacitance retention at 200 mV s-1 and a long cycle life. Furthermore, the energy density of the assembled all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor can reach up to 5.5 mW h g-1 at a power density of 141.4 mW g-1. Serving as a stable power source unit, the all-solid-state supercapacitor was also integrated with a flex sensor to fabricate a self-powered device. The route to fabricate Ti3C2Tx/Nb2CTx hybrid films with enhanced electrochemical performance is also applicable for other MXenes, promoting the application of MXenes in flexible supercapacitors and integrated electronic devices.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["All-solid-state supercapacitors", "Capacitance retention", "Capacitive performance", "Electrochemical performance", "Gravimetric capacitance", "Integrated electronics", "Interlayer spacings", "Two Dimensional (2 D)"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090158359", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57218711269": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "57218711269", "AffiliationID": "60030270", "AffiliationName": "Guangxi Colleges and Universities, Key Laboratory of Novel Energy Materials and Related Technology, Guangxi Novel Battery Materials Research Center of Engineering Technology, Center on Nanoenergy Research, College of Physics Science and Technology, Guangxi University"}, "55777909700": {"Name": "Guo J.", "AuthorID": "55777909700", "AffiliationID": "60030270", "AffiliationName": "Guangxi Colleges and Universities, Key Laboratory of Novel Energy Materials and Related Technology, Guangxi Novel Battery Materials Research Center of Engineering Technology, Center on Nanoenergy Research, College of Physics Science and Technology, Guangxi University"}, "26029926400": {"Name": "Huang H.", "AuthorID": "26029926400", "AffiliationID": "60030270", "AffiliationName": "Guangxi Colleges and Universities, Key Laboratory of Novel Energy Materials and Related Technology, Guangxi Novel Battery Materials Research Center of Engineering Technology, Center on Nanoenergy Research, College of Physics Science and Technology, Guangxi University"}, "25654051000": {"Name": "Liang X.", "AuthorID": "25654051000", "AffiliationID": "60030270", "AffiliationName": "Guangxi Colleges and Universities, Key Laboratory of Novel Energy Materials and Related Technology, Guangxi Novel Battery Materials Research Center of Engineering Technology, Center on Nanoenergy Research, College of Physics Science and Technology, Guangxi University"}, "57193549714": {"Name": "Xu S.", "AuthorID": "57193549714", "AffiliationID": "60030270", "AffiliationName": "Guangxi Colleges and Universities, Key Laboratory of Novel Energy Materials and Related Technology, Guangxi Novel Battery Materials Research Center of Engineering Technology, Center on Nanoenergy Research, College of Physics Science and Technology, Guangxi University"}, "55700195700": {"Name": "Dall'Agnese Y.", "AuthorID": "55700195700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Materials Discovery, University College London"}}}
