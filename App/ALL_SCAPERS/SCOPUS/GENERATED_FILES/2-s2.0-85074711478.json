This allows for functional validation of pathogenic mutations and establishes a system to understand the etiology of disease. Due to the ease of genetic manipulation and rapid ex utero development, the zebrafish has become a valuable resource to study important biological processes, including nephrogenesis. The development and function of the zebrafish pronephros are akin to that of mammals. As such, they offer a tractable model to study kidney disease, especially diabetic nephropathy. However, in order to study kidney dysfunction in zebrafish it is imperative that an appropriate readout is available. The appearance of macro-proteins in patient\u2019s urine is indicative of defective kidney function. In this technical chapter, we describe the in vivo use of fluorescently tagged dextrans of different molecular weights to reveal the integrity of the zebrafish glomerular filtration barrier.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diabetes", "Glomerular filtration", "Nephropathy", "Proteinuria", "Zebrafish"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Animals, Genetically Modified", "Dextrans", "Diabetic Nephropathies", "Disease Models, Animal", "Embryo, Nonmammalian", "Female", "Fluorescent Dyes", "Genes, Reporter", "Glomerular Filtration Barrier", "Kidney Glomerulus", "Male", "Pronephros", "Zebrafish", "Zebrafish Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074711478", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"7801544561": {"Name": "Kolatsi-Joannou M.", "AuthorID": "7801544561", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "15839807000": {"Name": "Osborn D.", "AuthorID": "15839807000", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Genetics Research Centre, St George\u2019s University of London"}}}
