Management of recurrent UTIs in PwMS can be challenging and characteristics of such patients are not well described. Aims: To describe the neurological and urological features of PwMS presenting to hospital for UTIs and identify areas of management that could be improved to reduce UTI frequency. Methods: Health episode statistics data were used to identify PwMS presenting to a tertiary hospital with UTI over a 5-year period. Medical records were reviewed for demographic, MS and urological history. The seven PwMS with the highest numbers of encounters were seen in a multidisciplinary clinic to enable detailed assessments. Results: 52 PwMS (25 female, 27 male) with mean age of 60 had 112 emergency department presentations and 102 inpatient admissions for UTI. 24 presented multiple times and were more likely to be older and male with progressive MS. Almost two-thirds were using a urinary catheter. Less than half were under current urological and neurological follow-up. Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas spp were the commonest organisms cultured. Resistance to antibiotics was more frequent in patients with multiple presentations. Conclusions: PwMS presenting to hospital for UTIs are more often male, older, with progressive MS and high levels of disability. A small group of PwMS accounted for a large number of encounters. Preventative and management strategies can be applied in primary and secondary care settings, with an emphasis on bladder, catheter and general physical care.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088952040", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57211231743": {"Name": "Li V.", "AuthorID": "57211231743", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Uro-Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery and UCL Institute of Neurology, Queen Square"}, "57218378398": {"Name": "Barker N.", "AuthorID": "57218378398", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148, 60176027", "AffiliationName": "Queen Square Multiple Sclerosis Centre, Department of Neuroinflammation, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "7201565381": {"Name": "Porter B.", "AuthorID": "7201565381", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148, 60176027", "AffiliationName": "Queen Square Multiple Sclerosis Centre, Department of Neuroinflammation, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "57212501583": {"Name": "Chataway J.", "AuthorID": "57212501583", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research, University College London Hospitals, Biomedical Research Centre"}, "8862148900": {"Name": "Panicker J.N.", "AuthorID": "8862148900", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Uro-Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery and UCL Institute of Neurology, Queen Square"}, "57189294591": {"Name": "Pakzad M.", "AuthorID": "57189294591", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Uro-Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery and UCL Institute of Neurology, Queen Square"}, "24511900500": {"Name": "Curtis C.", "AuthorID": "24511900500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Microbiology, University College London Hospitals"}}}
