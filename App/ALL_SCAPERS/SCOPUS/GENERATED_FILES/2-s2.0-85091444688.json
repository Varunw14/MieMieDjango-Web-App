A blood-fluid level within the haematoma, as revealed by computed tomography (CT), has been suggested as a marker for oral anticoagulant-associated ICH (OAC-ICH), but the diagnostic specificity and prognostic value of this finding remains unclear. In 855 patients with CT-confirmed acute ICH scanned within 48 h of symptom onset, we investigated the sensitivity and specificity of the presence of a CT-defined blood-fluid level (rated blinded to anticoagulant status) for identifying concomitant anticoagulant use. We also investigated the association of the presence of a blood-fluid level with six-month case fatality. Eighteen patients (2.1%) had a blood-fluid level identified on CT; of those with a blood-fluid level, 15 (83.3%) were taking anticoagulants. The specificity of blood-fluid level for OAC-ICH was 99.4%; the sensitivity was 4.2%. We could not detect an association between the presence of a blood-fluid level and an increased risk of death at six months (OR = 1.21, 95% CI 0.28\u20133.88, p = 0.769). The presence of a blood-fluid level should alert clinicians to the possibility of OAC-ICH, but absence of a blood-fluid level is not useful in excluding OAC-ICH.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Oral", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Anticoagulants", "Cerebral Hemorrhage", "Humans", "Male", "Neuroimaging", "Prognosis", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091444688", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57194680893": {"Name": "Almarzouki A.", "AuthorID": "57194680893", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Stroke Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology and the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57202955229": {"Name": "Wilson D.", "AuthorID": "57202955229", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Stroke Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology and the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57194282491": {"Name": "Shakeshaft C.", "AuthorID": "57194282491", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Stroke Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology and the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57197409420": {"Name": "Brown M.M.", "AuthorID": "57197409420", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Stroke Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology and the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "6603707621": {"Name": "Werring D.J.", "AuthorID": "6603707621", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Stroke Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology and the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7003730066": {"Name": "Ambler G.", "AuthorID": "7003730066", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "7402809618": {"Name": "Cohen H.", "AuthorID": "7402809618", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Haemostasis Research Unit, Department of Haematology, University College London"}, "7006486284": {"Name": "Yousry T.", "AuthorID": "7006486284", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Lysholm Department of Neuroradiology and the Neuroradiological Academic Unit, Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "26642970600": {"Name": "J\u00e4ger H.R.", "AuthorID": "26642970600", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Lysholm Department of Neuroradiology and the Neuroradiological Academic Unit, Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6701462635": {"Name": "Salman R.A.S.", "AuthorID": "6701462635", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, School of Clinical Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "57216675273": {"Name": "Lip G.Y.H.", "AuthorID": "57216675273", "AffiliationID": "60022134", "AffiliationName": "Aalborg Thrombosis Research Unit, Department of Clinical Medicine, Aalborg University"}, "57202651298": {"Name": "Muir K.W.", "AuthorID": "57202651298", "AffiliationID": "60001490, 60117212", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology, University of Glasgow, Queen Elizabeth University Hospital"}, "7003363686": {"Name": "Houlden H.", "AuthorID": "7003363686", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology and the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
