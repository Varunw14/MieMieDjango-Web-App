Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimMXenes derived from 413 MAX phases are rarely studied but they have the potential to have superior electrical and mechanical properties thanks to a thicker monolayer (four layers of transition metal and three layers of carbon or nitrogen). In this paper, Nb4C3Tx MXene nanosheets are delaminated and freestanding film with 1.77 nm interlayer spacing is obtained, which is larger than that of most previous MXenes. When Nb4C3Tx freestanding films are tested as supercapacitors electrodes, Nb4C3Tx shows high volumetric capacitance, 1075, 687, and 506 F cm\u22123 in 1 m H2SO4, 1 m KOH, and 1 m MgSO4, respectively, at the scan rate of 5 mV s\u22121. An in situ X-ray diffraction technique is used to study the structural changes during the electrochemical charging in 1 m H2SO4 and 1 m MgSO4. There is almost no change in the 21 \u00c5 interlayer spacing during the cycling, because the space between the MXene layers is sufficient to accommodate the insertion and deinsertion of cations. This can lead to stable performance of Nb4C3Tx MXene energy storage devices.", "AuthorKeywords": ["flexible devices", "MXenes", "niobium carbide", "supercapacitors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electrical and mechanical properties", "Electrochemical charging", "Freestanding films", "In-situ X-ray diffraction", "Interlayer spacings", "Space between", "Stable performance", "Volumetric capacitance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083843274", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57194063197": {"Name": "Zhao S.", "AuthorID": "57194063197", "AffiliationID": "60014662", "AffiliationName": "A.
