The planar injection of one fluid into a fluid-saturated, two-dimensional porous medium with a permeability that varies perpendicular to the flow direction is studied. Three cases are considered, in which the injected fluid is equally viscous, more viscous or less viscous than the ambient fluid. In general it is found that the flow in each case evolves through three regimes. at early times, the flow exhibits the concentration evolves diffusively, independent of both the permeability structure and the viscosity ratio. at intermediate times, the flow exhibits different dynamics including channelling and fingering, depending on whether the injected fluid is more or less viscous than the ambient fluid, and depending on the relative magnitude of the viscosity and permeability variations. Finally, at late times, the flow becomes independent of the viscosity ratio and dominated by shear-enhanced (Taylor) dispersion. For each of the regimes identified above, we develop reduced-order models for the evolution of the transversely averaged concentration and compare them to the full numerical simulations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["fingering instability", "mixing and dispersion", "porous media"], "IndexKeywords": ["Fingering instabilities", "High-resolution numerical simulation", "Layered porous media", "Miscible displacement", "Mixing and dispersions", "Permeability heterogeneity", "Permeability structure", "Theoretical modelling"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079751735", "SubjectAreas": [["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"57144647700": {"Name": "Nijjer J.S.", "AuthorID": "57144647700", "AffiliationID": "60119937, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, University of Cambridge"}, "55240280900": {"Name": "Hewitt D.R.", "AuthorID": "55240280900", "AffiliationID": "60119937, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, University of Cambridge"}, "25029656800": {"Name": "Neufeld J.a.", "AuthorID": "25029656800", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "BP Institute, University of Cambridge"}}}
