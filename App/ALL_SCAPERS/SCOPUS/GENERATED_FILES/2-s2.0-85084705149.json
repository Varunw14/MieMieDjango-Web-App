Current pCLE reconstruction is based on interpolating irregular signals onto an over-sampled Cartesian grid, using a naive linear interpolation. It was shown that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) could improve pCLE image quality. Yet classical CNNs may be suboptimal in regard to irregular data. Methods: We compare pCLE reconstruction and super-resolution (SR) methods taking irregularly sampled or reconstructed pCLE images as input. We also propose to embed a Nadaraya\u2013Watson (NW) kernel regression into the CNN framework as a novel trainable CNN layer. We design deep learning architectures allowing for reconstructing high-quality pCLE images directly from the irregularly sampled input data. We created synthetic sparse pCLE images to evaluate our methodology. Results: The results were validated through an image quality assessment based on a combination of the following metrics: peak signal-to-noise ratio and the structural similarity index. Our analysis indicates that both dense and sparse CNNs outperform the reconstruction method currently used in the clinic. Conclusion: The main contributions of our study are a comparison of sparse and dense approach in pCLE image reconstruction. We also implement trainable generalised NW kernel regression as a novel sparse approach. We also generated synthetic data for training pCLE SR.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CNN", "Nadaraya\u2013Watson kernel regression", "pCLE reconstruction", "Super-resolution"], "IndexKeywords": ["Endoscopy", "Humans", "Microscopy, Confocal", "Microsurgery", "Neural Networks, Computer", "Signal-To-Noise Ratio"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084705149", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"57201697389": {"Name": "Szczotka A.B.", "AuthorID": "57201697389", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences, University College London"}, "7006920406": {"Name": "Clarkson M.J.", "AuthorID": "7006920406", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences, University College London"}, "38562092100": {"Name": "Shakir D.I.", "AuthorID": "38562092100", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgical & Interventional Engineering, King\u2019s College London"}, "23010613000": {"Name": "Vercauteren T.", "AuthorID": "23010613000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgical & Interventional Engineering, King\u2019s College London"}, "57201696886": {"Name": "Rav\u00ec D.", "AuthorID": "57201696886", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC), Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "55944100900": {"Name": "Pereira S.P.", "AuthorID": "55944100900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London"}}}
