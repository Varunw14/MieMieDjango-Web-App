Published by BMJ.Objectives To identify: (i) risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in homeless versus housed individuals and (ii) interventions for CVD in homeless populations. Methods We conducted a systematic literature review in EMBASE until December 2018 using a search strategy for observational and interventional studies without restriction regarding languages or countries. Meta-analyses were conducted, where appropriate and possible. Outcome measures were all-cause and CVD mortality, and morbidity. Results Our search identified 17 articles (6 case-control, 11 cohort) concerning risk of CVD and none regarding specific interventions. Nine were included to perform a meta-analysis. The majority (13/17, 76.4%) were high quality and all were based in Europe or North America, including 765 459 individuals, of whom 32 721 were homeless. 12/17 studies were pre-2011. Homeless individuals were more likely to have CVD than non-homeless individuals (pooled OR 2.96; 95% CI 2.80 to 3.13; p<0.0001; heterogeneity p<0.0001; I 2 =99.1%) and had increased CVD mortality (age-standardised mortality ratio range: 2.6-6.4). Compared with non-homeless individuals, hypertension was more likely in homeless people (pooled OR 1.38-1.75, p=0.0070; heterogeneity p=0.935; I 2 =0.0%). Conclusions Homeless people have an approximately three times greater risk of CVD and an increased CVD mortality. However, there are no studies of specific pathways/interventions for CVD in this population. Future research should consider design and evaluation of tailored interventions or integrating CVD into existing interventions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["global healthcare delivery", "health care delivery", "quality and outcomes of care"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091126437", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57210823385": {"Name": "Al-Shakarchi N.J.", "AuthorID": "57210823385", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical School, University College London"}, "57194768067": {"Name": "Evans H.", "AuthorID": "57194768067", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}, "14623146100": {"Name": "Story A.", "AuthorID": "14623146100", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Find and Treat Service, University College London Hospitals Nhs Foundation Trust"}, "57208560645": {"Name": "Banerjee A.", "AuthorID": "57208560645", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, University College London Hospitals Nhs Foundation Trust"}, "25825267700": {"Name": "Luchenski S.A.", "AuthorID": "25825267700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, University College London"}}}
