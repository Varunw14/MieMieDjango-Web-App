The purpose of this study is to identify and analyze unique genetic signatures for breast cancer grades using publicly available gene expression microarray data. The classification of cancer types is based on unsupervised feature learning. Unsupervised clustering use matrix algebra based on similarity measures which made it suitable for analyzing gene expression. The main advantage of the proposed approach is the ability to use gene expression data from different grades of breast cancer to generate features that automatically identify and enhance the cancer diagnosis. In this paper, we tested different similarity measures in order to find the best way that identifies the sets of genes with a common function using expression microarray data.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adaptive filtering", "breast cancer", "gene expression", "hierarchical clustering", "unsupervised machine learning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Breast Cancer", "Expression microarray", "Gene Expression Data", "Gene expression microarray", "Similarity measure", "Unsupervised clustering", "Unsupervised feature learning", "Unsupervised machine learning"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082020475", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Media Technology", "ENGI", "2214"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"7003699541": {"Name": "Hamoudi R.", "AuthorID": "7003699541", "AffiliationID": "60070813", "AffiliationName": "Sharjah Institute for Medical Research; Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Medicine, University of Sharjah"}, "55503841000": {"Name": "Hachim M.", "AuthorID": "55503841000", "AffiliationID": "60070813", "AffiliationName": "Sharjah Institute for Medical Research; Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Medicine, University of Sharjah"}, "57209271202": {"Name": "Bettayeb M.", "AuthorID": "57209271202", "AffiliationID": "60070813", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Sharjah"}, "57203842667": {"Name": "Alsaafin A.", "AuthorID": "57203842667", "AffiliationID": "60070813", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, College of Science, University of Sharjah"}, "57215827738": {"Name": "Nassir Q.", "AuthorID": "57215827738", "AffiliationID": "60070813", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Sharjah"}, "36606459700": {"Name": "Nassif A.B.", "AuthorID": "36606459700", "AffiliationID": "60070813", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Engineering, College of Computing and Informatics, University of Sharjah"}}}
