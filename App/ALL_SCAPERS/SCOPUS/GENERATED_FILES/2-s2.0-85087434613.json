However, despite the established importance of nuclear receptors in maintaining metabolic homeostasis, our understanding of how phosphorylation affects metabolic diseases is limited. The physiological consequences of LXR\u03b1 phosphorylation have, until recently, been studied only in vitro or nonspecifically in animal models by pharmacologically or genetically altering the enzymes enhancing or inhibiting these modifications. Here we review recent reports on the physiological consequences of modifying LXR\u03b1 phosphorylation at serine 196 (S196) in cardiometabolic disease, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, atherosclerosis, and obesity. A unifying theme from these studies is that LXR\u03b1 S196 phosphorylation rewires the LXR-modulated transcriptome, which in turn alters physiological response to environmental signals, and that this is largely distinct from the LXR-ligand-dependent action.", "AuthorKeywords": ["atherosclerosis", "liver X receptors", "NAFLD", "nuclear receptors", "obesity", "phosphorylation", "transcription"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Atherosclerosis", "Disease Models, Animal", "Liver X Receptors", "Metabolic Syndrome", "Mice", "Molecular Targeted Therapy", "Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease", "Obesity", "Phosphorylation", "Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087434613", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"55756261700": {"Name": "Voisin M.", "AuthorID": "55756261700", "AffiliationID": "60024541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, New York University School of Medicine"}, "57189012340": {"Name": "Shrestha E.", "AuthorID": "57189012340", "AffiliationID": "60024541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, New York University School of Medicine"}, "7401996221": {"Name": "Fisher E.A.", "AuthorID": "7401996221", "AffiliationID": "60024541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, New York University School of Medicine"}, "35926758800": {"Name": "Garabedian M.J.", "AuthorID": "35926758800", "AffiliationID": "60024541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, New York University School of Medicine"}, "24830499600": {"Name": "Gage M.C.", "AuthorID": "24830499600", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Comparative Biomedical Sciences, Royal Veterinary College"}, "37062922900": {"Name": "Becares N.", "AuthorID": "37062922900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Clinical Pharmacology, Division of Medicine, University College of London"}, "7801465530": {"Name": "Pineda-Torra I.", "AuthorID": "7801465530", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Cardiometabolic and Vascular Science, Division of Medicine, University College of London"}}}
