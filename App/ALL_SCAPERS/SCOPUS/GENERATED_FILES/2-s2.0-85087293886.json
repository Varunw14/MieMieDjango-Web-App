International Journal of Pharmacy Practice published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Royal Pharmaceutical SocietyObjectives: Medication reviews in the domiciliary setting are becoming more prevalent internationally. Understanding the benefits of these reviews is essential to ensuring quality healthcare services. To date there has not been a systematic evaluation of the outcomes of these services and their impact on patients. A systematic review of the literature was undertaken with a view to understanding the impact of medication reviews in this setting. Controlled and uncontrolled studies were included. Outcomes were categorised according to the ECHO model. A narrative synthesis was developed. Key findings: Nineteen out of 31 papers included demonstrated an improvement in outcome. Clinical outcomes were the most commonly measured and humanistic outcomes the least commonly measured. Domiciliary medication reviews (DMRs) services are presented as providing benefit. However, it is difficult to quantify the impact of services from the published outcomes. Summary: Future work should focus on demonstrating the meaningful changes to patients that DMRs have enabled.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adherence", "domiciliary care", "inappropriate prescribing", "medication review"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087293886", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacy", "HEAL", "3611"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57217492531": {"Name": "McCormick P.", "AuthorID": "57217492531", "AffiliationID": "60162048", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacy Department, Whittington Health"}, "7006628298": {"Name": "Bates I.", "AuthorID": "7006628298", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57217484635": {"Name": "Chennells R.", "AuthorID": "57217484635", "AffiliationID": "60162048", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacy Department, Whittington Health"}, "57217574581": {"Name": "Coleman B.", "AuthorID": "57217574581", "AffiliationID": "60162048", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacy Department, Whittington Health"}}}
