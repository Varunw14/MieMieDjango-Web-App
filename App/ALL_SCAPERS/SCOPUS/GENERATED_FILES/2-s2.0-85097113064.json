Using a clonal approach, we previously detected 200\u2013400 mosaic SNVs per cell in three human fetal brains (15\u201321 wk postconception). However, structural variation in the human fetal brain has not yet been investigated. Here, we discover and validate four mosaic structural variants (SVs) in the same brains and resolve their precise breakpoints. The SVs were of kilobase scale and complex, consisting of deletion(s) and rearranged genomic fragments, which sometimes originated from different chromosomes. Sequences at the breakpoints of these rearrangements had microhomologies, suggesting their origin from replication errors. One SV was found in two clones, and we timed its origin to \u223c14 wk postconception. No large scale mosaic copy number variants (CNVs) were detectable in normal fetal human brains, suggesting that previously reported megabase-scale CNVs in neurons arise at later stages of development. By reanalysis of public single nuclei data from adult brain neurons, we detected an extrachromosomal circular DNA event. Our study reveals the existence of mosaic SVs in the developing human brain, likely arising from cell proliferation during mid-neurogenesis. Although relatively rare compared to SNVs and present in \u223c10% of neurons, SVs in developing human brain affect a comparable number of bases in the genome (\u223c6200 vs. \u223c4000 bp), implying that they may have similar functional consequences.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85097113064", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"56516506800": {"Name": "Sekar S.", "AuthorID": "56516506800", "AffiliationID": "60005558", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences Research, Center for Individualized Medicine, Mayo Clinic"}, "36969162800": {"Name": "Bae T.", "AuthorID": "36969162800", "AffiliationID": "60005558", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences Research, Center for Individualized Medicine, Mayo Clinic"}, "56485947100": {"Name": "Manlove L.", "AuthorID": "56485947100", "AffiliationID": "60005558", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences Research, Center for Individualized Medicine, Mayo Clinic"}, "57220168390": {"Name": "Jang Y.", "AuthorID": "57220168390", "AffiliationID": "60005558", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences Research, Center for Individualized Medicine, Mayo Clinic"}, "8732206000": {"Name": "Abyzov A.", "AuthorID": "8732206000", "AffiliationID": "60005558", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences Research, Center for Individualized Medicine, Mayo Clinic"}, "6701492417": {"Name": "Tomasini L.", "AuthorID": "6701492417", "AffiliationID": "60015278, 60005455", "AffiliationName": "Child Study Center, Department of Neuroscience, Yale University"}, "57204577823": {"Name": "Scuderi S.", "AuthorID": "57204577823", "AffiliationID": "60015278, 60005455", "AffiliationName": "Child Study Center, Department of Neuroscience, Yale University"}, "56985540700": {"Name": "Amiri A.", "AuthorID": "56985540700", "AffiliationID": "60015278, 60005455", "AffiliationName": "Child Study Center, Department of Neuroscience, Yale University"}, "23993048200": {"Name": "Mariani J.", "AuthorID": "23993048200", "AffiliationID": "60015278, 60005455", "AffiliationName": "Child Study Center, Department of Neuroscience, Yale University"}, "7007036219": {"Name": "Vaccarino F.M.", "AuthorID": "7007036219", "AffiliationID": "60015278, 60005455", "AffiliationName": "Child Study Center, Department of Neuroscience, Yale University"}, "7003596824": {"Name": "Proukakis C.", "AuthorID": "7003596824", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57212565915": {"Name": "Kalyva M.", "AuthorID": "57212565915", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57191367888": {"Name": "Zhou B.", "AuthorID": "57191367888", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Psychiatry and Genetics, Stanford University"}, "7103271580": {"Name": "Urban A.E.", "AuthorID": "7103271580", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Psychiatry and Genetics, Stanford University"}, "55246029800": {"Name": "Sedlazeck F.J.", "AuthorID": "55246029800", "AffiliationID": "60002441", "AffiliationName": "Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine"}}}
