Design: Cross-lag analysis of longitudinal data collected online at baseline and 12-month follow-up. Setting and Participants: A United Kingdom population cohort of 11,855 participants aged 50 years and over. Measures: Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (depressive symptoms), cognitive measures: Paired Associate Learning, Verbal Reasoning, Spatial Working Memory, and Digit Span. Results: Depressive symptoms predicted a decline in paired associates learning [\u03b2 = \u2212.020, P = .013, (95% confidence interval [CI], \u2012.036, \u2212.004)] and verbal reasoning [\u03b2 = \u2212.014, P = .016, (95% CI \u2012.025, \u2212.003)] but not vice versa. Depressive symptoms predicted [\u03b2 = \u2212.043, P < .001, (95% CI \u2012.060, \u2212.026); \u03b2 = \u2212.029, P < .001, (95% CI \u2012.043, \u2212.015)] and were predicted by [\u03b2 = \u2212.030, P = < .001, (95% CI \u2012.047, \u2212.014); \u03b2 = \u2212.025, P = .003, (95% CI \u2012.041, \u2212.009)], a decline in spatial working memory and verbal digit span, respectively. Conclusions and Implications: Depressive symptoms may be either a risk factor or prodrome for cognitive decline. In addition, a decline in attention predicts depressive symptoms. Clinical implications and implications for further research are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cognition", "depression", "Depressive symptoms"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081209453", "SubjectAreas": [["Nursing (all)", "NURS", "2900"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"57220655753": {"Name": "Desai R.", "AuthorID": "57220655753", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6602617245": {"Name": "Charlesworth G.M.", "AuthorID": "6602617245", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "12783188400": {"Name": "Potts H.W.W.", "AuthorID": "12783188400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "25926251000": {"Name": "Brooker H.J.", "AuthorID": "25926251000", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Exeter University"}, "35572940700": {"Name": "Corbett A.", "AuthorID": "35572940700", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Exeter University"}, "35351371500": {"Name": "Ballard C.G.", "AuthorID": "35351371500", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Exeter University"}, "56222844000": {"Name": "Aarsland D.", "AuthorID": "56222844000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London"}}}
