An independent component analysis (ICA) based equalization structure is employed at destination to separate and detect the desired signal from the residual SI in a semi-blind way. The mode of SI cancelation at relay is chosen adaptively based on the threshold of signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) at relay. The proposed FD relay system not only features reduced signal processing cost of SI cancelation, but also achieves much higher energy efficiency (EE) than conventional FD relay systems where SI is canceled as much as possible. Also, the proposed system enables full resource utilization via consecutive data transmission at all time and the same frequency, leading to much higher throughput and EE than the conventional time-splitting and power-splitting based SI recycling approaches that occupy partial resources. Last but not least, the proposed system demonstrates a bit error rate (BER) performance that is robust against a wide range of SI and close to the ideal case with perfect channel state information (CSI) and perfect SI cancelation, while requiring no training sequence for estimation of any channel involved.", "AuthorKeywords": ["full-duplex (FD)", "independent component analysis (ICA)", "relay", "self-interference"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bit error rate (BER) performance", "Full-duplex", "Independent component analysis(ICA)", "Perfect channel state information", "relay", "Resource utilizations", "Self-interferences", "Signal-to-interference ratio"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074789004", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"57211668438": {"Name": "Duan H.", "AuthorID": "57211668438", "AffiliationID": "60019616", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology"}, "55574545800": {"Name": "Jiang Y.", "AuthorID": "55574545800", "AffiliationID": "60019616", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology"}, "57208802684": {"Name": "Zhu X.", "AuthorID": "57208802684", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, University of Liverpool, Brownlow Hill"}, "57157980000": {"Name": "Gao L.", "AuthorID": "57157980000", "AffiliationID": "60019616", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology"}, "57201437243": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "57201437243", "AffiliationID": "60102426", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University"}, "57158079100": {"Name": "Wei Z.", "AuthorID": "57158079100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College London"}}}
