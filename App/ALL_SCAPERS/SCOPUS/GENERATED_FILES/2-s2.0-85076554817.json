This leads to deformation of the porous matrix, pressurization of the interstitial fluid and relaxation due to redistribution of fluid through the pores. In most studies the poroelastic properties, including elastic modulus, Poisson ratio and poroelastic diffusion coefficient, are extracted by assuming an instantaneous step indentation. However, exerting step like indentation is not experimentally possible and usually a ramp indentation with a finite approach velocity is applied. Moreover, the poroelastic relaxation time highly depends on the approach velocity in addition to the poroelastic diffusion coefficient and the contact area. Here, we extensively studied the effect of indentation velocity using finite element simulations which has enabled the formulation of a new framework based on a master curve that incorporates the finite rise time. To verify our novel framework, the poroelastic properties of two types of hydrogels were extracted experimentally using indentation tests at both macro and micro scales. Our new framework that is based on consideration of finite approach velocity is experimentally easy to implement and provides a more accurate estimation of poroelastic properties. Statement of significance: Hydrogels, tissues and living cells are constituted of a sponge-like porous elastic matrix bathed in an interstitial fluid. It has been shown that these materials behave according to the theory of \u2018poroelasticity\u2019 when mechanically stimulated in a way similar to that experienced in organs within the body. In this theory, the rate at which the fluid-filled sponge can be deformed is limited by how fast interstitial fluid can redistribute within the sponge in response to deformation. Here, we simulated indentation experiments at different rates and formulated a new framework that inherently captures the effects of stimulation speed on the mechanical response of poroelastic materials. We validated our framework by conducting experiments at different length-scales on agarose and polyacrylamide hydrogels.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atomic force microscopy", "Finite element model", "Hydrogels", "Indentation", "Poroelasticity", "Relaxation time"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076554817", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"57212378189": {"Name": "Esteki M.H.", "AuthorID": "57212378189", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "21933504300": {"Name": "Alemrajabi A.A.", "AuthorID": "21933504300", "AffiliationID": "60028174", "AffiliationName": "Isfahan University of Technology"}, "57209978484": {"Name": "Hall C.M.", "AuthorID": "57209978484", "AffiliationID": "60007919", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences, University of Brighton"}, "24554512000": {"Name": "Moeendarbary E.", "AuthorID": "24554512000", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "16246338000": {"Name": "Sheridan G.K.", "AuthorID": "16246338000", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60030816", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Sciences, Queen's Medical Centre, University of Nottingham"}, "26424516000": {"Name": "Azadi M.", "AuthorID": "26424516000", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}}}
