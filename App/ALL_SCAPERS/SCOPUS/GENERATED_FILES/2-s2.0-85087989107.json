Methods: We conducted a point-prevalence study in a cohort of COVID-19 inpatients at University College Hospital. Delirium was defined by DSM-IV criteria. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 4 weeks; secondary outcomes were physical and cognitive function. Results: In 71 patients (mean age 61, 75% men), 31 (42%) had delirium, of which only 12 (39%) had been recognised by the clinical team. At 4 weeks, 20 (28%) had died, 26 (36%) were interviewed by telephone and 21 (30%) remained as inpatients. Physical function was substantially worse in people after delirium \u2212 50 out of 166 points (95% CI \u2212 83 to \u2212 17, p = 0.01). Mean cognitive scores at follow-up were similar and delirium was not associated with mortality in this sample. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that delirium is common, yet under-recognised. Delirium is associated with functional impairments in the medium term.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Barthel Index", "COVID-19", "Delirium", "Nottingham extended activities of daily living", "Telephone interview for cognitive status"], "IndexKeywords": ["Activities of Daily Living", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Betacoronavirus", "Cognition", "Coronavirus Infections", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Delirium", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pandemics", "Pneumonia, Viral", "Severity of Illness Index"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087989107", "SubjectAreas": [["Gerontology", "NURS", "2909"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"57218124106": {"Name": "Mcloughlin B.C.", "AuthorID": "57218124106", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine for the Elderly, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57218127964": {"Name": "Miles A.", "AuthorID": "57218127964", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine for the Elderly, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57218116410": {"Name": "Webb T.E.", "AuthorID": "57218116410", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine for the Elderly, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35311122400": {"Name": "Knopp P.", "AuthorID": "35311122400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine for the Elderly, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57218126161": {"Name": "Eyres C.", "AuthorID": "57218126161", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine for the Elderly, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57218119022": {"Name": "Fabbri A.", "AuthorID": "57218119022", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine for the Elderly, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57209248466": {"Name": "Humphries F.", "AuthorID": "57209248466", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine for the Elderly, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55350725000": {"Name": "Davis D.", "AuthorID": "55350725000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Department of Population Science and Experimental Medicine, MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL"}}}
