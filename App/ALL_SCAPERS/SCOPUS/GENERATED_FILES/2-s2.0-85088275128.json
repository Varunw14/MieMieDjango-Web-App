We show here that the CEST approach can be extended to systems with symmetrical exchange, where the NMR signals of all exchanging species are severely broadened. To achieve this, multiquantum CEST (MQ-CEST) is introduced, where the CEST pulse is applied to a longitudinal multispin order density element and the CEST profiles are encoded onto nonbroadened nuclei. The MQ-CEST approach is demonstrated on the restricted rotation of guanidinium groups in arginine residues within proteins. These groups and their dynamics are essential for many enzymes and for noncovalent interactions through the formation of hydrogen bonds, salt-bridges, and \u03c0-stacking interactions, and their rate of rotation is highly indicative of the extent of interactions formed. The MQ-CEST method is successfully applied to guanidinium groups in the 19 kDa L99A mutant of T4 lysozyme.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Arginine residue", "Chemical exchange saturation transfer", "Multi-spin orders", "NMR experiments", "Non-covalent interaction", "Restricted rotations", "Rotational dynamics", "Salt bridges", "Arginine", "Bacteriophage T4", "Guanidines", "Molecular Structure", "Muramidase", "Mutation", "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular", "Viral Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088275128", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57189592844": {"Name": "Karunanithy G.", "AuthorID": "57189592844", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "25924919300": {"Name": "Hansen D.F.", "AuthorID": "25924919300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "7003426456": {"Name": "Reinstein J.", "AuthorID": "7003426456", "AffiliationID": "60014117", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomolecular Mechanisms, Max Planck Institute for Medical Research"}}}
