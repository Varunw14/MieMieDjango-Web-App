Ultrasound imaging is portable and universally safe, but existing modalities cannot image usefully inside the adult human skull. We use in silico simulations to demonstrate that full-waveform inversion, a computational technique originally developed in geophysics, is able to generate accurate three-dimensional images of the brain with sub-millimetre resolution. This approach overcomes the familiar problems of conventional ultrasound neuroimaging by using the following: transcranial ultrasound that is not obscured by strong reflections from the skull, low frequencies that are readily transmitted with good signal-to-noise ratio, an accurate wave equation that properly accounts for the physics of wave propagation, and adaptive waveform inversion that is able to create an accurate model of the skull that then compensates properly for wavefront distortion. Laboratory ultrasound data, using ex vivo human skulls and in vivo transcranial signals, demonstrate that our computational experiments mimic the penetration and signal-to-noise ratios expected in clinical applications. This form of non-invasive neuroimaging has the potential for the rapid diagnosis of stroke and head trauma, and for the provision of routine monitoring of a wide range of neurological conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086999790", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"], ["Health Information Management", "HEAL", "3605"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"57212833609": {"Name": "Guasch L.", "AuthorID": "57212833609", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "57218243891": {"Name": "Calder\u00f3n Agudo O.", "AuthorID": "57218243891", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "7201940035": {"Name": "Warner M.", "AuthorID": "7201940035", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "35346143000": {"Name": "Tang M.X.", "AuthorID": "35346143000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"}, "6602253325": {"Name": "Nachev P.", "AuthorID": "6602253325", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
