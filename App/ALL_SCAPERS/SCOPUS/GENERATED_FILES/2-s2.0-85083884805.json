All rights reserved.Background: There is limited data on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in sporadic amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Objective: To determine the profile of biomarkers relevant to neurodegenerative disease in the CSF of patients with CAA. Methods: We performed a detailed comparison of CSF markers, comparing patients with CAA, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and control (CS) participants, recruited from the Biomarkers and Outcomes in CAA (BOCAA) study, and a Specialist Cognitive Disorders Service. Results: We included 10 CAA, 20 AD, and 10 CS participants (mean age 68.6, 62.5, and 62.2 years, respectively). In unadjusted analyses, CAA patients had a distinctive CSF biomarker profile, with significantly lower (p<0.01) median concentrations of A\u03b238, A\u03b240, A\u03b242, sA\u03b2PP\u03b1, and sA\u03b2PP\u03b2. CAA patients had higher levels of neurofilament light (NFL) than the CS group (p<0.01), but there were no significant differences in CSF total tau, phospho-tau, soluble TREM2 (sTREM2), or neurogranin concentrations. AD patients had higher total tau, phospho-tau and neurogranin than CS and CAA groups. In age-adjusted analyses, differences for the CAA group remained for A\u03b238, A\u03b240, A\u03b242, and sA\u03b2PP\u03b2. Comparing CAA patients with amyloid-PET positive (n=5) and negative (n=5) scans, PET positive individuals had lower (p<0.05) concentrations of CSF A\u03b242, and higher total tau, phospho-tau, NFL, and neurogranin concentrations, consistent with an 'AD-like' profile. Conclusion: CAA has a characteristic biomarker profile, suggestive of a global, rather than selective, accumulation of amyloid species; we also provide evidence of different phenotypes according to amyloid-PET positivity. Further replication and validation of these preliminary findings in larger cohorts is needed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "amyloid-\u03b2", "biomarkers", "cerebral amyloid angiopathy", "cerebrospinal fluid"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083884805", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57130290000": {"Name": "Banerjee G.", "AuthorID": "57130290000", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Research Centre, Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Russell Square House"}, "6603707621": {"Name": "Werring D.J.", "AuthorID": "6603707621", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Research Centre, Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Russell Square House"}, "7003730066": {"Name": "Ambler G.", "AuthorID": "7003730066", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "55034699600": {"Name": "Keshavan A.", "AuthorID": "55034699600", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "55799312800": {"Name": "Paterson R.W.", "AuthorID": "55799312800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "7201444328": {"Name": "Fox N.C.", "AuthorID": "7201444328", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL"}, "57213315348": {"Name": "Schott J.M.", "AuthorID": "57213315348", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "57193198963": {"Name": "Foiani M.S.", "AuthorID": "57193198963", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL"}, "14029427000": {"Name": "Toombs J.", "AuthorID": "14029427000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL"}, "36463576300": {"Name": "Heslegrave A.", "AuthorID": "36463576300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL"}, "7004224851": {"Name": "Lunn M.P.", "AuthorID": "7004224851", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Disease, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57208899083": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "57208899083", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Salhgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "8960246600": {"Name": "DIckson J.C.", "AuthorID": "8960246600", "AffiliationID": "60027403, 60022148, 60090043", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, UCL, University College Hospital"}, "36905492400": {"Name": "Fraioli F.", "AuthorID": "36905492400", "AffiliationID": "60027403, 60022148, 60090043", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, UCL, University College Hospital"}, "7004435019": {"Name": "Groves A.M.", "AuthorID": "7004435019", "AffiliationID": "60027403, 60022148, 60090043", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, UCL, University College Hospital"}}}
