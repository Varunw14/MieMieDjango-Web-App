KGaA, WeinheimSMILE (Solar wind Magnetosphere Ionosphere Link Explorer) is a space mission which aims to measure Earth's global system responses to solar wind and geomagnetic variations with innovative instrumentation, for example, wide\u2013field X-ray telescope of Lobster\u2013Eye type, on board. It is a collaborative project of the European Space Agency and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The SMILE international consortium involves the Czech Technical University in Prague and the Czech teams are expected to contribute to the project, mainly to the science and software related to the X\u2013ray telescope. The aim of this short paper is to provide an outline of SMILE and in particular of the Czech participation to this mission, with emphasis on observation of celestial X-ray sources as SMILE secondary science.", "AuthorKeywords": ["earth", "space vehicles: instruments", "sun: solar-terrestrial relations", "X-rays: general"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085319411", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"7006655807": {"Name": "Hudec R.", "AuthorID": "7006655807", "AffiliationID": "60070941", "AffiliationName": "Engelhardt Observatory, Kazan Federal University"}, "55977044100": {"Name": "Simon V.", "AuthorID": "55977044100", "AffiliationID": "60001847, 60031135", "AffiliationName": "Astronomical Institute, Czech Academy of Sciences, Ondrejov"}, "57220431211": {"Name": "Branduardi-Raymont G.", "AuthorID": "57220431211", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, Department of Space and Climate Physics, University College London"}, "6603807229": {"Name": "Sembay S.", "AuthorID": "6603807229", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester"}}}
