Polarized apical and basolateral protein secretions are a feature of airway epithelium homeostasis. Human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) is a major human pathogen that primarily targets the respiratory epithelium. However, the consequences of hRSV infection on epithelium secretome polarity and content remain poorly understood. To investigate the hRSV-associated apical and basolateral secretomes, a proteomics approach was combined with an ex vivo pediatric human airway epithelial (HAE) model of hRSV infection (data are available via ProteomeXchange and can be accessed at https://www.ebi. ac.uk/pride/ with identifier PXD013661). Following infection, a skewing of apical/basolateral abundance ratios was identified for several individual proteins. Novel modulators of neutrophil and lymphocyte activation (CXCL6, CSF3, SECTM1 or CXCL16), and antiviral proteins (BST2 or CEACAM1) were detected in infected, but not in uninfected cultures. Importantly, CXCL6, CXCL16, CSF3 were also detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) from hRSV-infected infants but not healthy controls. Furthermore, the antiviral activity of CEACAM1 against RSV was confirmed in vitro using BEAS-2B cells. hRSV infection disrupted the polarity of the pediatric respiratory epithelial secretome and was associated with immune modulating proteins (CXCL6, CXCL16, CSF3) never linked with this virus before. In addition, the antiviral activity of CEACAM1 against hRSV had also never been previously characterized. This study, therefore, provides novel insights into RSV pathogenesis and endogenous antiviral responses in pediatric airway epithelium.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084389187", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"16054006800": {"Name": "Touzelet O.", "AuthorID": "16054006800", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome-Wolfson Institute for Experimental Medicine, School of Medicine, Dentistry & Biomedical Sciences, Queens University Belfast"}, "35745454000": {"Name": "Armstrong S.D.", "AuthorID": "35745454000", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Emerging and Zoonotic Infections, University of Liverpool"}, "56366856300": {"Name": "Aljabr W.", "AuthorID": "56366856300", "AffiliationID": "60091176", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Administration, Research Centre, King Fahad Medical City"}, "7004565877": {"Name": "Hiscox J.A.", "AuthorID": "7004565877", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Chair in Infection and Global Health, Department of Infection Biology, Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool"}, "56677649500": {"Name": "Broadbent L.", "AuthorID": "56677649500", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome-Wolfson Institute for Experimental Medicine, School of Medicine, Dentistry & Biomedical Sciences, Queens University Belfast"}, "6603755460": {"Name": "Power U.F.", "AuthorID": "6603755460", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome-Wolfson Institute for Experimental Medicine, School of Medicine, Dentistry & Biomedical Sciences, Queens University Belfast"}, "40661103700": {"Name": "Cloutman-Green E.", "AuthorID": "40661103700", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Microbiology, Virology and Infection Control, Level 4 Camelia Botnar Laboratory, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}}}
