Clinical decision support (CDS) is an important area where AI can augment the clinician's capability to collect, understand and make inferences on an overwhelming volume of patient data to reach the optimal clinical decision. Advancements in medical image analysis, such as Radiomics, and data computation, such as machine learning, have expanded our understanding of disease processes and their management. In this article, we review the most relevant concepts of AI as applicable to advanced imaging-based clinical decision support systems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Artificial", "Clinical", "Decision", "Intelligence", "Radiomics", "Support"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086879089", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57192896709": {"Name": "Shaikh F.", "AuthorID": "57192896709", "AffiliationID": "60116090", "AffiliationName": "Image Analysis Group"}, "57217692356": {"Name": "Dehmeshki J.", "AuthorID": "57217692356", "AffiliationID": "60116090", "AffiliationName": "Image Analysis Group"}, "57217235175": {"Name": "Roettger-Dupont D.", "AuthorID": "57217235175", "AffiliationID": "60116090", "AffiliationName": "Image Analysis Group"}, "8893431300": {"Name": "Kubassova O.", "AuthorID": "8893431300", "AffiliationID": "60116090", "AffiliationName": "Image Analysis Group"}, "14627355000": {"Name": "Bisdas S.", "AuthorID": "14627355000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University College London"}, "57217439424": {"Name": "Aziz M.", "AuthorID": "57217439424", "AffiliationID": "115345632", "AffiliationName": "Windsor University School of Medicine"}, "35736958900": {"Name": "Awan O.", "AuthorID": "35736958900", "AffiliationID": "60014653", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University of Maryland"}}}
