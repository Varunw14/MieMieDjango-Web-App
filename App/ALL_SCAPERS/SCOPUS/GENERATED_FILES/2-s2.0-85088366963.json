Immediately thereafter, a one day workshop in honour of Professor Zoran Lj. Petrovi\u0107, to acknowledge his many scientific contributions over a very distinguished career and to celebrate his retirement, was also held. This topical issue showcases contributions that encompass original research papers and topical reviews, on themes consistent with both POSMOL and the Workshop, as well as further contributions from the wider POSMOL community.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088366963", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"7004997852": {"Name": "Brunger M.J.", "AuthorID": "7004997852", "AffiliationID": "60101841", "AffiliationName": "Department of Actuarial Science and Applied Statistics, Faculty of Business and Information Science, UCSI"}, "54790549500": {"Name": "Cassidy D.B.", "AuthorID": "54790549500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "55398254900": {"Name": "Dujko S.", "AuthorID": "55398254900", "AffiliationID": "60068815", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics, University of Belgrade"}, "7005112918": {"Name": "Mari\u0107 D.", "AuthorID": "7005112918", "AffiliationID": "60068815", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics, University of Belgrade"}, "7006019245": {"Name": "Marler J.", "AuthorID": "7006019245", "AffiliationID": "60026610", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Clemson University"}, "22969227700": {"Name": "Sullivan J.P.", "AuthorID": "22969227700", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "Plasma Research Laboratories, The Research School of Physics, Australian National University"}, "7003522440": {"Name": "Fedor J.", "AuthorID": "7003522440", "AffiliationID": "120789501", "AffiliationName": "J.
