In this observational, retrospective cross-sectional study, segmented macular spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) volume scans were reviewed to investigate if this observation also holds true for anterograde trans-synaptic degeneration. Significant thinning was found in all retinal layers in patients with outer retinal diseases compared with the healthy controls, while there was no significant attenuation of the outer retina in patients with MS. In contrast to the tight barrier function observed with retrograde trans-synaptic degeneration, the INL appears to be more permissive for the propagation of anterograde trans-synaptic degeneration. We speculate that this may be due to the size of the area affected and be explained by convergence and divergence of axons within the retinal layers. These findings are likely relevant to future restorative stem cell treatment of the outer retinal layers, as time may matter.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anterograde degeneration", "inner nuclear layer", "optical coherence tomography", "Retrograde degeneration", "trans-synaptic degeneration"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075007564", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57212316721": {"Name": "Panneman E.L.", "AuthorID": "57212316721", "AffiliationID": "121595516", "AffiliationName": "Expertisecentre Neuro-Ophthalmology, Departments of Neurology and Ophthalmology, Amsterdam UMC"}, "57195981562": {"Name": "Coric D.", "AuthorID": "57195981562", "AffiliationID": "121595516", "AffiliationName": "MS Centre Amsterdam, Department of Neurology, Amsterdam UMC"}, "57212307011": {"Name": "Tran L.M.D.", "AuthorID": "57212307011", "AffiliationID": "121595516", "AffiliationName": "Expertisecentre Neuro-Ophthalmology, Departments of Neurology and Ophthalmology, Amsterdam UMC"}, "6603658213": {"Name": "de Vries-Knoppert W.A.E.J.", "AuthorID": "6603658213", "AffiliationID": "121595516", "AffiliationName": "Expertisecentre Neuro-Ophthalmology, Departments of Neurology and Ophthalmology, Amsterdam UMC"}, "7006826396": {"Name": "Petzold A.", "AuthorID": "7006826396", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60016691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuro-ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital, City Road & National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
