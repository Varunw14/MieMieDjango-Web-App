Objective: To investigate the effect of transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (TTNS) and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with biofeedback on OAB symptoms in female MS patients. Methods: This study was conducted at the outpatient MS clinic in Istanbul. At baseline bladder diary, post-voiding residue (PVR), OAB, and Qualiveen Scales (QoL: Quality of Life; Siup: Specific Impact of Urinary Problems on QoL) were assessed. Patients were allocated to receive TTNS or PFMT daily for 6 weeks and reevaluated using the same tests. Results: Fifty-five patients (TTNS = 28, PFMT = 27) were included. Compared with baseline, both TTNS and PFMT groups improved in terms of OAB (p = 0.0001, p = 0.0001), Qualiveen-siup (p = 0.0001, p = 0.0001), Qualiveen-QoL (p = 0.002, p = 0.006), PVR (p = 0.0001, p = 0.21), frequency (p = 0.0001, p = 0.69), nocturia (p = 0.0001, p = 0.19), urgency (p = 0.0001, p = 0.0001), and urge incontinence (p = 0.0001, p = 0.0001). Between-group comparisons showed significant differences in 24-hour frequency (p = 0.002) in favor of TTNS. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates the efficacy of both TTNS and PFMT for managing OAB symptoms in MS, associated with a significant impact on QoL, but did not show superiority of the methods. Further studies are needed to explore differences between these two non-invasive treatments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["multiple sclerosis", "overactive bladder", "pelvic floor muscle training", "Transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation", "women"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086237840", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57191920038": {"Name": "Polat Dunya C.", "AuthorID": "57191920038", "AffiliationID": "60117280", "AffiliationName": "Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa"}, "23571091400": {"Name": "Tulek Z.", "AuthorID": "23571091400", "AffiliationID": "60117280", "AffiliationName": "Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa"}, "6508110751": {"Name": "K\u00fcrt\u00fcnc\u00fc M.", "AuthorID": "6508110751", "AffiliationID": "60012324, 60028502", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University"}, "6603420500": {"Name": "Eraksoy M.", "AuthorID": "6603420500", "AffiliationID": "60012324, 60028502", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University"}, "8862148900": {"Name": "Panicker J.N.", "AuthorID": "8862148900", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Uro-Neurology, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}}}
