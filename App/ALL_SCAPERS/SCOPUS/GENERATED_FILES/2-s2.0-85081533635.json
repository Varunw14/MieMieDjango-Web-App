These are a group of paroxysmal and precipitated headaches, which often occur in bouts with prolonged remissions. Indometacin seems to be the most effective preventative. Each can occur in primary and secondary form. Thunderclap headache is the most frequently reported headache syndrome associated with a secondary pathology. Discussed are the complexities of whether all patients with thunderclap headache should have further investigation if timely computerised tomography is normal and, the relevance of abnormal imaging in these disorders, differentiating what is deemed to be secondary and managing the pain.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coital", "Cough headache", "Exertional", "Orgasmic headache", "Sexual", "Thunderclap headache"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081533635", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"6603476799": {"Name": "Bahra A.", "AuthorID": "6603476799", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London (UCL)"}}}
