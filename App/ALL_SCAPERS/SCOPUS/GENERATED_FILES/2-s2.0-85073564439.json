While previous studies have been performed in pure buffer, we approach the mechanism in vivo using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We investigated the aggregation mechanism of A\u03b242 in human CSF through kinetic experiments at several A\u03b242 monomer concentrations (0.8\u201310 \u00b5M). The data were subjected to global kinetic analysis and found consistent with an aggregation mechanism involving secondary nucleation of monomers on the fibril surface. A mechanism only including primary nucleation was ruled out. We find that the aggregation process is composed of the same microscopic steps in CSF as in pure buffer, but the rate constant of secondary nucleation is decreased. Most importantly, the autocatalytic amplification of aggregate number through catalysis on the fibril surface is prevalent also in CSF.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Humans", "Kinetics", "Peptide Fragments", "Protein Aggregation, Pathological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073564439", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"]], "AuthorData": {"57211343617": {"Name": "Frankel R.", "AuthorID": "57211343617", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Structural Biology, Lund University"}, "57201364980": {"Name": "T\u00f6rnquist M.", "AuthorID": "57201364980", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Structural Biology, Lund University"}, "6603133907": {"Name": "Frohm B.", "AuthorID": "6603133907", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Structural Biology, Lund University"}, "6602962999": {"Name": "Cedervall T.", "AuthorID": "6602962999", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Structural Biology, Lund University"}, "14037797800": {"Name": "Leiding T.", "AuthorID": "14037797800", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Structural Biology, Lund University"}, "7004924118": {"Name": "Linse S.", "AuthorID": "7004924118", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Structural Biology, Lund University"}, "54795619000": {"Name": "Meisl G.", "AuthorID": "54795619000", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Cambridge University"}, "14012356200": {"Name": "Knowles T.P.J.", "AuthorID": "14012356200", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "7006190615": {"Name": "Hansson O.", "AuthorID": "7006190615", "AffiliationID": "60014077", "AffiliationName": "Memory Clinic, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital"}, "6507790467": {"Name": "Andreasson U.", "AuthorID": "6507790467", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "57208899083": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "57208899083", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at University College London"}, "7101909602": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "7101909602", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}}}
