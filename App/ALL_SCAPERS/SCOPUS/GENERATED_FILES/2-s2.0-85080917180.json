Methods Secondary analyses of the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (NSSATS) from 2007-16 were conducted. We provide bivariate descriptive statistics regarding substance abuse treatment services which offered buprenorphine and methadone treatment from 2007-16. Using multiple logistic regression, we regressed geographic, organisational, and payment correlates on buprenorphine and methadone treatment. Results Buprenorphine is increasingly offered at SAT facilities though uptake remains comparatively low outside of the northeast. SAT facilities run by tribal governments or Indian Health Service which offer buprenorphine remain low compared to privately operated SAT facilities (AOR = 0.528). The odds of offering buprenorphine among facilities offering free or no charge treatment (AOR = 0.838) or a sliding fee scale (AOR = 0.464) was lower. SAT facilities accepting Medicaid payments showed higher odds of offering methadone treatment (AOR = 2.035). Conclusions Greater attention towards the disparities in provision of opioid agonist therapies is warranted, especially towards the reasons why uptake has been moderate among civilian providers. Additionally, the care needs of Native Americans facing opioid-related use disorders bears further scrutiny.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Analgesics, Opioid", "Buprenorphine", "Cost of Illness", "Geography", "Healthcare Disparities", "Humans", "Medicaid", "Methadone", "Narcotic Antagonists", "Opiate Substitution Treatment", "Opioid Epidemic", "Opioid-Related Disorders", "Substance Abuse Treatment Centers", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United States"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85080917180", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57202692614": {"Name": "Yang J.C.", "AuthorID": "57202692614", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Applied Clinical Research, Division of Psychiatry, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "56011388000": {"Name": "Roman-Urrestarazu A.", "AuthorID": "56011388000", "AffiliationID": "60009587, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge"}, "57210872598": {"Name": "Brayne C.", "AuthorID": "57210872598", "AffiliationID": "60009587, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge"}}}
