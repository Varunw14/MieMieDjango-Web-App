All rights reserved.Stemness encompasses the capability of a cell for self-renewal and differentiation. The stem cell maintains a balance between proliferation, quiescence, and regeneration via interactions with the microenvironment. Previously, we showed that ectopic expression of the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S18-2 (MRPS18-2) led to immortalization of primary fibroblasts, accompanied by induction of an embryonic stem cell (ESC) phenotype. Moreover, we demonstrated interaction between S18-2 and the retinoblastoma-associated protein (RB) and hypothesized that the simultaneous expression of RB and S18-2 is essential for maintaining cell stemness. Here, we experimentally investigated the role of S18-2 in cell stemness and differentiation. Concurrent expression of RB and S18-2 resulted in immortalization of Rb1\u2212/\u2212 primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts and in aggressive tumor growth in severe combined immunodeficiency mice. These cells, which express both RB and S18-2 at high levels, exhibited the potential to differentiate into various lineages in vitro, including osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic lineages. Mechanistically, S18-2 formed a multimeric protein complex with prohibitin and the ring finger protein 2 (RNF2). This molecular complex increased the monoubiquitination of histone H2ALys119, a characteristic trait of ESCs, by enhanced E3-ligase activity of RNF2. Furthermore, we found enrichment of KLF4 at the S18-2 promoter region and that the S18-2 expression is positively correlated with KLF4 levels. Importantly, knockdown of S18-2 in zebrafish larvae led to embryonic lethality. Collectively, our findings suggest an important role for S18-2 in cell stemness and differentiation and potentially also in cancerogenesis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cell immortalization", "Embryogenesis", "Stemness and differentiation", "Tumorigenesis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell Self Renewal", "Fibroblasts", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Histones", "Human Embryonic Stem Cells", "Humans", "Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors", "Mice", "Mitochondria", "Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells", "Polycomb Repressive Complex 1", "Retinoblastoma Binding Proteins", "Ribosomal Proteins", "Tumor Microenvironment", "Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088208109", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56816557500": {"Name": "Mushtaq M.", "AuthorID": "56816557500", "AffiliationID": "60089696", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Life Sciences and Informatics, Balochistan University of Information Technology, Engineering and Management Sciences"}, "35299061900": {"Name": "Darekar S.", "AuthorID": "35299061900", "AffiliationID": "60012311, 60019295", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Biomedicum, Karolinska Institutet"}, "34770221200": {"Name": "Kashuba V.", "AuthorID": "34770221200", "AffiliationID": "60068520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Oncogenetics, Institute of Molecular Biology and Genetics of National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine"}, "35780510700": {"Name": "Klein G.", "AuthorID": "35780510700", "AffiliationID": "60012311, 60019295", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Biomedicum, Karolinska Institutet"}, "35742618900": {"Name": "Arsenian-Henriksson M.", "AuthorID": "35742618900", "AffiliationID": "60012311, 60019295", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Biomedicum, Karolinska Institutet"}, "7004495138": {"Name": "Kashuba E.", "AuthorID": "7004495138", "AffiliationID": "60068536, 60011313", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Molecular Mechanisms of Cell Transformation, RE Kavetsky Institute of Experimental Pathology, Oncology and Radiobiology of National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine"}, "6506402117": {"Name": "Kovalevska L.", "AuthorID": "6506402117", "AffiliationID": "60068536, 60011313", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Molecular Mechanisms of Cell Transformation, RE Kavetsky Institute of Experimental Pathology, Oncology and Radiobiology of National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine"}, "6603188649": {"Name": "Abramsson A.", "AuthorID": "6603188649", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg"}, "57208899083": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "57208899083", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg"}}}
