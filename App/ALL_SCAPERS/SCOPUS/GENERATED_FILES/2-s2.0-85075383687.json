These students live on the banks of the polluted Hebron Stream in Israel, where a three-pronged restoration program has recently been established, including the stream\u2019s rehabilitation, the establishment of local waste treatment, and an environmental education program. Our study follows groups of fifth-graders (n = 107) throughout a 2-year, place-based learning program in the Hebron Stream area. The program\u2019s purpose is to teach students about authentic environmental phenomena in the stream\u2019s surroundings, while fostering their sense of attachment to the stream. Data were gathered, before, during, and after the intervention, via drawings and individual interviews, and analyzed using quantitative and qualitative content analysis. The findings show that after the intervention, Hebron Stream became part of the students\u2019 sense of place, with many students drawing a cleaner, more esthetically pleasing stream, and about a third drawing the stream as a \u201chealthy\u201d ecosystem. The students\u2019 explanations of their drawings showed a rise in their awareness of the stream\u2019s importance as a natural resource, and an increased awareness of the relationship between the stream, the community, and political-economic situation. Though they were openly critical of flaws in the current progress of the restoration process, they also expressed optimism regarding the improvement in the stream\u2019s conditions that contrasted sharply with their earlier fatalistic attitudes. This change in attitude was also expressed in declared changes in the students\u2019 personal environmental behaviors. The results of this study provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between people and their immediate environment. It offers both pedagogical and theoretical recommendations for studies of sense of place and place-based education initiatives undertaken in contaminated natural environments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Elementary school", "Place-based education", "Polluted environment", "Rehabilitation", "Sense of place"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075383687", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"55744754300": {"Name": "Sedawi W.", "AuthorID": "55744754300", "AffiliationID": "60027161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Science and Technology Education, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"}, "8618053000": {"Name": "Assaraf O.B.Z.", "AuthorID": "8618053000", "AffiliationID": "60027161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Science and Technology Education, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"}, "7202205455": {"Name": "Reiss M.J.", "AuthorID": "7202205455", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University of London"}}}
