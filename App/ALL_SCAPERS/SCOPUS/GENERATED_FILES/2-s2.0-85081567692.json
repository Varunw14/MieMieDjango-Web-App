Understanding the foaming process is critical for process optimization. Here, we applied high-speed synchrotron X-ray tomography to investigate the change in pore structure during the foaming process, quantifying the foam structures and porosity dynamically. The results can provide guidance for the manufacturing of glass foams. The 3D pore structures were also used to computationally determine \u03bb of glass foams using image-based modelling. We then used the simulated \u03bb to develop a new analytical model to predict the porosity dependence of \u03bb. The \u03bb values of the glass foams when the porosity is within 40% to 95% predicted by the new model are in excellent agreement with the experimental data collected from the literature, with an average error of only 0.7%, which performs better than previously proposed models.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D image analysis", "Glass foam", "Porosity", "Simulation", "Thermal conductivity"], "IndexKeywords": ["3D image analysis", "Glass foams", "Image-based modelling", "Insulating performance", "Porosity dependence", "Simulation", "Synchrotron X-ray tomography", "Thermal insulation materials"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081567692", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Polymers and Plastics", "MATE", "2507"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"]], "AuthorData": {"56865619000": {"Name": "\u00d8stergaard M.B.", "AuthorID": "56865619000", "AffiliationID": "60022134", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Bioscience, Aalborg University"}, "55978805800": {"Name": "Petersen R.R.", "AuthorID": "55978805800", "AffiliationID": "60022134", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Bioscience, Aalborg University"}, "7101695480": {"Name": "Yue Y.", "AuthorID": "7101695480", "AffiliationID": "60022134", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Bioscience, Aalborg University"}, "57215656483": {"Name": "Zhang M.", "AuthorID": "57215656483", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Metallurgy and Materials, University of Birmingham"}, "57215666803": {"Name": "Shen X.", "AuthorID": "57215666803", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Metallurgy and Materials, University of Birmingham"}, "35090012600": {"Name": "Cai B.", "AuthorID": "35090012600", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Metallurgy and Materials, University of Birmingham"}, "22957724200": {"Name": "K\u00f6nig J.", "AuthorID": "22957724200", "AffiliationID": "60023955", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Materials Department, Jo\u017eef Stefan Institute"}, "8504683300": {"Name": "Lee P.D.", "AuthorID": "8504683300", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, RAL"}}}
