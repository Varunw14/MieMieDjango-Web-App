Although many factors have been implicated, including modifiable and nonmodifiable patient factors, emphasis over the past decade has been on implant alignment and stability as both a cause of, and a solution to, this problem. Several alignment targets have evolved with a proliferation of techniques following the introduction of computer and robotic-assisted surgery. Mechanical alignment targets may achieve mechanically-sound alignment while ignoring the soft tissue envelope; kinematic alignment respects the soft tissue envelope while ignoring the mechanical environment. Functional alignment is proposed as a hybrid technique to allow mechanically-sound, soft tissue-friendly alignment targets to be identified and achieved.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee", "Humans", "Knee Joint", "Knee Prosthesis", "Osteoarthritis, Knee", "Range of Motion, Articular", "Robotic Surgical Procedures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85080840285", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"8908374800": {"Name": "Oussedik S.", "AuthorID": "8908374800", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57024870200": {"Name": "Abdel M.P.", "AuthorID": "57024870200", "AffiliationID": "60005558", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic"}, "7004258142": {"Name": "Pagnano M.W.", "AuthorID": "7004258142", "AffiliationID": "60005558", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic"}, "7102599986": {"Name": "Victor J.", "AuthorID": "7102599986", "AffiliationID": "60068590", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Ghent University Hospital"}, "7203033976": {"Name": "Haddad F.S.", "AuthorID": "7203033976", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, UCLH"}}}
