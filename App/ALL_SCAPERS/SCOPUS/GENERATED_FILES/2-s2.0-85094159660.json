These can be used by research funders, researchers and healthcare decision-makers within low-income and middle-income countries to support evidence-based research prioritisation. Methods The methods require three key assessments: (1) the current level of uncertainty around the endpoints the proposed study will measure; (2) how uncertainty impacts on the health benefits and costs of healthcare programmes and (3) the health opportunity costs imposed by programme costs. Research is valuable because it can improve health by informing the choice of which programmes should be implemented. We provide a Microsoft Excel tool to allow readers to generate estimates of the health benefits of research studies based on these three assessments. The tool can be populated using existing studies, existing cost-effectiveness models and expert opinion. Where such evidence is not available, the tool can quantify the value of research under different assumptions. Estimates of the health benefits of research can be considered alongside research costs, and the consequences of delaying implementation until research reports, to determine whether research is worthwhile. We illustrate the method using a case study of research on HIV self-testing programmes in Malawi. This analysis combines data from the literature with outputs from the HIV synthesis model. Results For this case study, we found a costing study that could be completed and inform decision making within 1 year offered the highest health benefits (67 000 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted). Research on outcomes improved population health to a lesser extent (12 000 DALYs averted) and only if carried out alongside programme implementation. Conclusion Our work provides a method for estimating the health benefits of research in a practical and timely fashion. This can be used to support accountable use of research funds.", "AuthorKeywords": ["health economics", "health services research", "HIV"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094159660", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"26656355900": {"Name": "Woods B.", "AuthorID": "26656355900", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Economics, University of York"}, "57190004800": {"Name": "Schmitt L.", "AuthorID": "57190004800", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Economics, University of York"}, "57189247892": {"Name": "Rothery C.", "AuthorID": "57189247892", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Economics, University of York"}, "57193543168": {"Name": "Revill P.", "AuthorID": "57193543168", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Economics, University of York"}, "7003973517": {"Name": "Claxton K.", "AuthorID": "7003973517", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Economics, University of York"}, "57202558738": {"Name": "Phillips A.", "AuthorID": "57202558738", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "35614255000": {"Name": "Hallett T.B.", "AuthorID": "35614255000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London"}}}
