Here we used high-throughput screening to analyze 358 proteins and 76 lipids, selected because of their relevance to obesity-associated diseases, in plasma and serum from age- and sex-matched lean and obese humans. Most of the proteins/lipids had similar concentrations in plasma and serum, but a subset showed significant differences. Notably, a key marker of cardiovascular disease PAI-1 showed a difference in concentration between the obese and lean groups only in plasma. Furthermore, some biomarkers showed poor correlations between plasma and serum, including PCSK9, an important regulator of cholesterol homeostasis. Collectively, our results show that the choice of biofluid may impact study outcome when screening for obesity-related biomarkers and we identify several markers where this will be the case.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Biomarkers", "Female", "Humans", "Kidney Diseases", "Male", "Metabolic Syndrome", "Middle Aged", "Obesity", "Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1", "Proprotein Convertase 9"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074193570", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57211501129": {"Name": "Rajan M.R.", "AuthorID": "57211501129", "AffiliationID": "60046006, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Wallenberg Centre for Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Gothenburg"}, "14053029500": {"Name": "Sotak M.", "AuthorID": "14053029500", "AffiliationID": "60046006, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Wallenberg Centre for Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Gothenburg"}, "24074044100": {"Name": "Barren\u00e4s F.", "AuthorID": "24074044100", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell & Molecular Biology, Uppsala University"}, "7102727485": {"Name": "Lindahl P.", "AuthorID": "7102727485", "AffiliationID": "60046006, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, Wallenberg Laboratory, Institute of Medicine, University of Gothenburg"}, "35208809000": {"Name": "Perkins R.", "AuthorID": "35208809000", "AffiliationID": "60046006, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, Wallenberg Laboratory, Institute of Medicine, University of Gothenburg"}, "8750565800": {"Name": "Lange S.", "AuthorID": "8750565800", "AffiliationID": "60030612", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiology, School of Medicine, University of California San Diego"}, "36439046100": {"Name": "B\u00f6rgeson E.", "AuthorID": "36439046100", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Physiology, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "55498735800": {"Name": "Ashton N.J.", "AuthorID": "55498735800", "AffiliationID": "60028884, 60171762", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Mental Health & Biomedical Research Unit for Dementia at South London & Maudsley NHS Foundation"}, "35070295800": {"Name": "Sch\u00f6ll M.", "AuthorID": "35070295800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57203571112": {"Name": "Shen T.", "AuthorID": "57203571112", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "NIH West Coast Metabolomics Center, Genome Center, University of California Davis"}, "56006079400": {"Name": "Borkowski K.", "AuthorID": "56006079400", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "NIH West Coast Metabolomics Center, Genome Center, University of California Davis"}, "7003325967": {"Name": "Fiehn O.", "AuthorID": "7003325967", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "NIH West Coast Metabolomics Center, Genome Center, University of California Davis"}, "35750276400": {"Name": "Newman J.W.", "AuthorID": "35750276400", "AffiliationID": "60001989, 60032280", "AffiliationName": "USDA, ARS, Western Human Nutrition Research Center"}, "26537117900": {"Name": "Bi\u00f6rserud C.", "AuthorID": "26537117900", "AffiliationID": "60031699, 60016437, 60027675", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastrosurgical Research and Education, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, University of Gothenburg"}, "6603484990": {"Name": "Wallenius V.", "AuthorID": "6603484990", "AffiliationID": "60031699, 60016437, 60027675", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastrosurgical Research and Education, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, University of Gothenburg"}, "7103136259": {"Name": "Lindahl T.L.", "AuthorID": "7103136259", "AffiliationID": "60009358", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Chemistry and Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Link\u00f6ping University"}, "6602485808": {"Name": "Ramstr\u00f6m S.", "AuthorID": "6602485808", "AffiliationID": "60008141", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Research Centre, School of Medical Sciences, \u00d6rebro University"}}}
