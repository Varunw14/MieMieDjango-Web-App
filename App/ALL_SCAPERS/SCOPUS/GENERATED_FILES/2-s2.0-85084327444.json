Through an interview format between different generations of IR scholars, the conversations of the book analyse the relationship between technology and concepts like power, security and global order. They explore to what extent ideas about the role and implications of technology help to understand the way IR has been framed and world politics are conceived of today. This innovative text will appeal to scholars in Politics and International Relations as well as STS, Human Geography and Anthropology.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084327444", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"26021005000": {"Name": "Acuto M.", "AuthorID": "26021005000", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "University of Melbourne"}, "57216701525": {"Name": "Carr M.", "AuthorID": "57216701525", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Science, Technology, Engineering and Public Policy (STEaPP), University College London"}, "55598716100": {"Name": "Kaltofen C.", "AuthorID": "55598716100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Science, Technology, Engineering and Public Policy (STEaPP), University College London"}}}
