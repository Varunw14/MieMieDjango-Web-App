The fidelity of the environment plays an important role for allowing corresponding spatial references in remote collaboration. We present a novel asymmetric platform, Augmented Virtual Teleportation (AVT), which provides high-fidelity telepresence of a remote VR user (VR-Traveler) into a real-world collaboration space to interact with a local AR user (AR-Host). AVT uses a 360\u00b0 video camera (360-camera) that captures and live-streams the omni-directional scenes over a network. The remote VR-Traveler watching the video in a VR headset experiences live presence and co-presence in the real-world collaboration space. The VR-Traveler's movements are captured and transmitted to a 3D avatar overlaid onto the 360-camera which can be seen in the AR-Host's display. The visual and audio cues for each collaborator are synchronized in the Mixed Reality Collaboration space (MRC-space), where they can interactively edit virtual objects and collaborate in the real environment using the real objects as a reference. High fidelity, real-time rendering of virtual objects and seamless blending into the real scene allows for unique mixed reality use-case scenarios. Our working prototype has been tested with a user study to evaluate spatial presence, co-presence, and user satisfaction during telecollaboration. Possible applications of AVT are identified and proposed to guide future usage.", "AuthorKeywords": ["360\u00b0 Panoramic Video", "Collaboration", "Mixed Reality", "Real-time", "Telepresence"], "IndexKeywords": ["Avatars", "Collaboration", "Panoramic video", "Real time", "Teleportation", "Telepresence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079667770", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"14619599800": {"Name": "Rhee T.", "AuthorID": "14619599800", "AffiliationID": "60002316", "AffiliationName": "Victoria University of Wellington"}, "57210915466": {"Name": "Thompson S.", "AuthorID": "57210915466", "AffiliationID": "60002316", "AffiliationName": "Victoria University of Wellington"}, "55428540900": {"Name": "Medeiros D.", "AuthorID": "55428540900", "AffiliationID": "60002316", "AffiliationName": "Victoria University of Wellington"}, "55389336300": {"Name": "Dos Anjos R.", "AuthorID": "55389336300", "AffiliationID": "60002316", "AffiliationName": "Victoria University of Wellington"}, "56043762100": {"Name": "Chalmers A.", "AuthorID": "56043762100", "AffiliationID": "60002316", "AffiliationName": "Victoria University of Wellington"}}}
