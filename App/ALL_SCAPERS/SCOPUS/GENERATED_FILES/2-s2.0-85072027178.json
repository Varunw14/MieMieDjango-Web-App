In this research, the role of lattice mismatch in the thermal degradation process of cesium-containing perovskite films on Al doped ZnO (AZO) is studied. A Ba(OH)2 buffer layer on the surface of AZO is employed to release the lattice mismatch and suppress the thermal degradation of perovskite films resulted from ZnO. Consequently, perovskite films with enhanced thermal stability and crystalline properties are obtained. Meanwhile, the Ba(OH)2 films efficiently passivate the surface trap states and reduce the vacuum level of the AZO surfaces. On this basis, electron transport layer-free perovskite solar cells yield the best efficiency of 18.18% and the thermal stability is obviously improved.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electron transport layer-free", "Lattice mismatch", "Perovskite solar cell", "Thermal stability"], "IndexKeywords": ["Al-doped ZnO", "Crystalline properties", "Electron transport layers", "Interface strain", "Perovskite films", "Specific surface", "Surface trap-states", "Vacuum level"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072027178", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57219324275": {"Name": "Zhang P.", "AuthorID": "57219324275", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "56990540700": {"Name": "Zhang T.", "AuthorID": "56990540700", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "55733853200": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "55733853200", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "57192198429": {"Name": "Liu D.", "AuthorID": "57192198429", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "57201864305": {"Name": "Chen L.", "AuthorID": "57201864305", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "57216471973": {"Name": "Chen Z.D.", "AuthorID": "57216471973", "AffiliationID": "60015941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering and Center for Nanoscale Science & Engineering, University of Kentucky"}, "54079892300": {"Name": "Li S.", "AuthorID": "54079892300", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "57200394975": {"Name": "Xu H.", "AuthorID": "57200394975", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "10141185300": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "10141185300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55719279200": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "55719279200", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Fundamental and Frontier Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}}}
