We investigated the heritability of these phenotypes, their association with BP-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and the causal association between BP and arterial stiffness. Methods and results: We assessed BP, central BP components, and haemodynamic properties (during a single visit) including CO, SVR, and pulse wave velocity (PWV, measure of arterial stiffness) in 3531 (1934 monozygotic, 1586 dizygotic) female TwinsUK participants. Heritability was estimated using structural equation modelling. Association with 984 BP-associated SNP was examined using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and generalized estimating equation regression. One and two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to estimate the causal direction between BP and arterial stiffness including data on 436 419 UK Biobank participants. We found high heritability for systolic and pulsatile components of BP (>50%) and PWV (65%) with overlapping genes accounting for >50% of their observed correlation. Environmental factors explained most of the variability of CO and SVR (>80%). Regression identified SNPs (n = 5) known to be associated with BP to also be associated with PWV. One-sample MR showed evidence of bi-directional causal association between BP and PWV in TwinsUK participants. Two-sample MR, confirmed a bi-directional causal effect of PWV on BP (inverse variance weighted (IVW) beta =.11, P <.02) and BP on arterial stiffness (IVW beta =.004, P <.0001). Conclusion: The genetic basis of BP is mediated not only by genes regulating BP but also by genes that influence arterial stiffness. Mendelian randomization indicates a bi-directional causal association between BP and arterial stiffness.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Arterial stiffness", "Blood pressure", "Genes", "Haemodynamics", "Mendelian randomization"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092750068", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"30667493200": {"Name": "Cecelja M.", "AuthorID": "30667493200", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Division, Department of Clinical Pharmacology, King's College London British Heart Foundation Centre, St Thomas' Hospital"}, "56123522000": {"Name": "Keehn L.", "AuthorID": "56123522000", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Division, Department of Clinical Pharmacology, King's College London British Heart Foundation Centre, St Thomas' Hospital"}, "57219445663": {"Name": "Ye L.", "AuthorID": "57219445663", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Division, Department of Clinical Pharmacology, King's College London British Heart Foundation Centre, St Thomas' Hospital"}, "7006409663": {"Name": "Chowienczyk P.", "AuthorID": "7006409663", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Division, Department of Clinical Pharmacology, King's College London British Heart Foundation Centre, St Thomas' Hospital"}, "35351391300": {"Name": "Spector T.D.", "AuthorID": "35351391300", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, King's College London, St Thomas' Hospital"}, "57207789660": {"Name": "Hughes A.D.", "AuthorID": "57207789660", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Population Science and Experimental Medicine, Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}}}
