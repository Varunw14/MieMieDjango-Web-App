Semi-structured interviews were conducted with organizational members of Transport for London (TfL), a public transport owner and operator organization and a key stakeholder in the UK infrastructure sector. This was combined with the analysis of four project assurance reviews initiated and delivered by TfL. The findings demonstrate that the PMO provides opportunities for building and enhancing innovative capabilities of the owner and operator organization.", "AuthorKeywords": ["innovation", "innovation capabilities", "owner and operator organization", "project life cycle", "project management office (PMO)"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084524018", "SubjectAreas": [["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"55218042800": {"Name": "Sergeeva N.", "AuthorID": "55218042800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57216757301": {"Name": "Ali S.", "AuthorID": "57216757301", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
