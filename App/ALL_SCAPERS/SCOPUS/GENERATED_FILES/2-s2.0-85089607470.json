Methods: We used repeated data of 3,188 respondents from Waves 2-7 (2004/2005-2014/2015) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. We examined longitudinal associations between short-term (frequent engagement at one wave), repeated (frequent engagement at 2-3 waves), and sustained (frequent engagement at 4-6 waves) arts engagement and experienced, evaluative and eudaimonic well-being. We fitted linear and logistic regression models adjusted for baseline well-being and a number of sociodemographic, economic, health, and social engagement factors. Results: In the fully adjusted models, short-term engagement was not longitudinally associated with well-being, but repeated engagement with the theater/concerts/opera and museums/galleries/exhibitions was associated with enhanced eudaimonic well-being, and sustained engagement with these activities was associated with greater experienced, evaluative, and eudaimonic well-being. Discussion: Long-term frequent engagement with certain arts activities is associated with higher levels of happiness, life satisfaction, self-realization, and control/autonomy in older adults. These findings suggest that policies that facilitate older adults' access to arts venues and activities, and support their continued engagement with them, may help to promote happy, fulfilling lives of an increasing segment of the population.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cohort study", "Cultural participation", "Eudaimonic well-being", "Evaluative well-being", "Hedonic well-being"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089607470", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Life-span and Life-course Studies", "SOCI", "3319"]], "AuthorData": {"57190403499": {"Name": "Tymoszuk U.", "AuthorID": "57190403499", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "55602471100": {"Name": "Perkins R.", "AuthorID": "55602471100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "36626442300": {"Name": "Spiro N.", "AuthorID": "36626442300", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "6602890097": {"Name": "Williamon A.", "AuthorID": "6602890097", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "55911947100": {"Name": "Fancourt D.", "AuthorID": "55911947100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}}}
