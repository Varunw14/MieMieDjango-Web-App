Endothelial cells that line the vasculature use molecular mechanosensors to directly detect shear stress profiles that will ultimately lead to atheroprotective or atherogenic responses2. Plexins are key cell-surface receptors of the semaphorin family of cell-guidance signalling proteins and can regulate cellular patterning by modulating the cytoskeleton and focal adhesion structures3\u20135. However, a role for plexin proteins in mechanotransduction has not been examined. Here we show that plexin D1 (PLXND1) has a role in mechanosensation and mechanically induced disease pathogenesis. PLXND1 is required for the response of endothelial cells to shear stress in vitro and in vivo and regulates the site-specific distribution of atherosclerotic lesions. In endothelial cells, PLXND1 is a direct force sensor and forms a mechanocomplex with neuropilin-1 and VEGFR2 that is necessary and sufficient for conferring mechanosensitivity upstream of the junctional complex and integrins. PLXND1 achieves its binary functions as either a ligand or a force receptor by adopting two distinct molecular conformations. Our results establish a previously undescribed mechanosensor in endothelial cells that regulates cardiovascular pathophysiology, and provide a mechanism by which a single receptor can exhibit a binary biochemical nature.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Atherosclerosis", "Endothelial Cells", "Female", "Integrins", "Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Mechanotransduction, Cellular", "Membrane Glycoproteins", "Mice", "Neuropilin-1", "Pliability", "Receptors, Cell Surface", "Semaphorins", "Stress, Mechanical", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079122047", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57193751275": {"Name": "Mehta V.", "AuthorID": "57193751275", "AffiliationID": "60099539, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford"}, "57214794124": {"Name": "Pang K.L.", "AuthorID": "57214794124", "AffiliationID": "60099539, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford"}, "57214806186": {"Name": "Nather K.", "AuthorID": "57214806186", "AffiliationID": "60099539, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford"}, "57214790360": {"Name": "Keen A.", "AuthorID": "57214790360", "AffiliationID": "60099539, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford"}, "7005839080": {"Name": "Reader J.S.", "AuthorID": "7005839080", "AffiliationID": "60099539, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford"}, "6602722160": {"Name": "Tzima E.", "AuthorID": "6602722160", "AffiliationID": "60099539, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford"}, "36053495300": {"Name": "Rozbesky D.", "AuthorID": "36053495300", "AffiliationID": "60099539, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Division of Structural Biology, Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford"}, "56440949900": {"Name": "Kong Y.", "AuthorID": "56440949900", "AffiliationID": "60099539, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Division of Structural Biology, Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford"}, "37090925700": {"Name": "Karia D.", "AuthorID": "37090925700", "AffiliationID": "60099539, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Division of Structural Biology, Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford"}, "57144631200": {"Name": "Ameismeier M.", "AuthorID": "57144631200", "AffiliationID": "60099539, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Division of Structural Biology, Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford"}, "7404236867": {"Name": "Jones E.Y.", "AuthorID": "7404236867", "AffiliationID": "60099539, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Division of Structural Biology, Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford"}, "57191091618": {"Name": "Lachowski D.", "AuthorID": "57191091618", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Cellular and Molecular Biomechanics Laboratory, Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"}, "57189524365": {"Name": "del Rio Hernandez A.", "AuthorID": "57189524365", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Cellular and Molecular Biomechanics Laboratory, Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"}, "57214806698": {"Name": "Huang J.", "AuthorID": "57214806698", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Duke University"}, "35728397300": {"Name": "Fang Y.", "AuthorID": "35728397300", "AffiliationID": "60029278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Chicago"}}}
