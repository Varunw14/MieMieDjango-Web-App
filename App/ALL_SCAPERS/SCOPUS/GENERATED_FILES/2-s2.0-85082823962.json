We show that uniqueness holds for a large class of non-linearities when the manifold is conformally transversally anisotropic. The proof is constructive and is based on a multiple-fold linearization of the semi-linear equation near complex geometric optic solutions for the linearized operator and the resulting non-linear interactions. These interactions result in the study of a weighted integral transform along geodesics, that we call the Jacobi weighted ray transform.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082823962", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"14830067300": {"Name": "Feizmohammadi A.", "AuthorID": "14830067300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "36241865400": {"Name": "Oksanen L.", "AuthorID": "36241865400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
