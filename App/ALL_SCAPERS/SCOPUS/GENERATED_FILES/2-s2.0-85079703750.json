We explored whether autistic adults display differences in how they integrate these cues by showing participants videos of students receiving their exams results. Our results suggest autistic adults generally perform as neurotypical participants when identifying and integrating affective and situational cues. It was only in certain unfamiliar and ambiguous social situations that autistic adults assigned less weight to affective cues compared to situational cues when judging other people\u2019s emotional states.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Emotions", "Faces", "Theory of mind"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Autistic Disorder", "Cues", "Emotions", "Facial Expression", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Social Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079703750", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"57164501700": {"Name": "Forbes P.A.G.", "AuthorID": "57164501700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60109771", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "38060964400": {"Name": "Hamilton A.F.d.C.", "AuthorID": "38060964400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60109771", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}}}
