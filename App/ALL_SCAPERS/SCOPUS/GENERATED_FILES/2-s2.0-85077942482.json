We investigated associations between abdominal adipose tissue, alterations in kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism, and systemic inflammation in people with HIV (PWH). METHODS: Eight hundred sixty-four PWH and 75 uninfected controls were included. Plasma samples were collected and analyzed for kynurenine metabolites, neopterin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and lipids. Regression models were used to test associations in PWH. RESULTS: PWH had higher kynurenine-to-tryptophan ratio than uninfected individuals (P < .001). In PWH, increase in waist-to-hip ratio was associated with higher kynurenine-to-tryptophan ratio (P = .009) and quinolinic-to-kynurenic acid ratio (P = .006) and lower kynurenic acid concentration (P = .019). Quinolinic-to-kynurenic acid ratio was associated with higher hs-CRP (P < .001) and neopterin concentrations (P < .001), while kynurenic acid was associated with lower hs-CRP (P = .025) and neopterin concentrations (P = .034). CONCLUSIONS: In PWH, increase in abdominal adipose tissue was associated with increased quinolinic-to-kynurenic acid ratio, suggesting activation of proinflammatory pathway of kynurenine metabolism, with reduction of anti-inflammatory molecules and increase in systemic inflammation. Our results suggest dysregulation of kynurenine metabolism associated with abdominal fat accumulation to be a potential source of inflammation in HIV infection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["abdominal adipose tissue", "HIV infection", "inflammation", "kynurenine"], "IndexKeywords": ["Abdominal Fat", "Aged", "Biomarkers", "C-Reactive Protein", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "HIV", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Kynurenic Acid", "Kynurenine", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neopterin", "Quinolinic Acid", "Tryptophan", "Waist-Hip Ratio"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077942482", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57191625235": {"Name": "Gelpi M.", "AuthorID": "57191625235", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Viro-immunology Research Unit, Department of Infectious Diseases 8632, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "35307337700": {"Name": "Lundgren J.", "AuthorID": "35307337700", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Excellence for Health, Immunity and Infections, Department of Infectious Diseases 8632, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "55666326400": {"Name": "Nielsen S.D.", "AuthorID": "55666326400", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Viro-immunology Research Unit, Department of Infectious Diseases 8632, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "7102609193": {"Name": "Ueland P.M.", "AuthorID": "7102609193", "AffiliationID": "60029622", "AffiliationName": "Section for Pharmacology, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen"}, "6602243615": {"Name": "Midttun \u00d8.", "AuthorID": "6602243615", "AffiliationID": "60029622", "AffiliationName": "Section for Pharmacology, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen"}, "11640977200": {"Name": "Tr\u00f8seid M.", "AuthorID": "11640977200", "AffiliationID": "60026108", "AffiliationName": "Section of Clinical Immunology and Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Rikshospitalet"}, "7006513758": {"Name": "Mocroft A.", "AuthorID": "7006513758", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "HIV Epidemiology and Biostatistics Unit, Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "7003337508": {"Name": "Lebech A.M.", "AuthorID": "7003337508", "AffiliationID": "60002327, 60015199", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital"}, "7003443013": {"Name": "Ullum H.", "AuthorID": "7003443013", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Immunology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}}}
