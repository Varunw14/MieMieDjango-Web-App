We have developed a method, Relate, scaling to >10,000 sequences while simultaneously estimating branch lengths, mutational ages and variable historical population sizes, as well as allowing for data errors. Application to 1,000 Genomes Project haplotypes produces joint genealogical histories for 26 human populations. Highly diverged lineages are present in all groups, but most frequent in Africa. Outside Africa, these mainly reflect ancient introgression from groups related to Neanderthals and Denisovans, while African signals instead reflect unknown events unique to that continent. Our approach allows more powerful inferences of natural selection than has previously been possible. We identify multiple regions under strong positive selection, and multi-allelic traits including hair color, body mass index and blood pressure, showing strong evidence of directional selection, varying among human groups.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Evolution, Molecular", "Genetics, Population", "Genome, Human", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Haplotypes", "Humans", "Mutation", "Neanderthals", "Pedigree", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Population Density", "Selection, Genetic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071720477", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"56024037800": {"Name": "Speidel L.", "AuthorID": "56024037800", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, University of Oxford"}, "57204150045": {"Name": "Shi S.", "AuthorID": "57204150045", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, University of Oxford"}, "57208733573": {"Name": "Myers S.R.", "AuthorID": "57208733573", "AffiliationID": "60099539, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford"}, "57220498917": {"Name": "Forest M.", "AuthorID": "57220498917", "AffiliationID": "60027863", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al"}}}
