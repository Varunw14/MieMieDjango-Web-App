Although wave loading on offshore structures due to non-breaking waves has been extensively studied, wave loading due to breaking waves is uncertain and not very well understood. Plunging breaking waves in deep water are very unusual, whereas spilling breaking waves are very common in extreme seas. Nevertheless, no significant research efforts have been made to study the effects of spilling breaking waves. The present study addresses this, comparing the wave loading from highly nonlinear non-breaking waves and spilling breaking waves. Focused wave groups have been used to generate the non-breaking and spilling breaking wave conditions in a wave tank. The experiments have shown that spilling breaking waves generate significantly larger forces on the cylindrical model than highly non-linear non-breaking waves of equivalent size. This is shown to be due to the direct excitation at high frequency as well as the resonant and impact excitation of higher natural frequency modes. It is concluded that spilling breaking waves can generate very significant forces and should therefore be considered in the design of offshore structures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Breaking waves", "Extreme waves", "Wave groups", "Wave-structure interactions"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cylindrical models", "Direct excitation", "High frequency HF", "Impact excitation", "Non-breaking waves", "Plunging breaking waves", "Spilling breaking waves", "Vertical cylinders"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091667543", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"]], "AuthorData": {"57219196698": {"Name": "Esandi J.M.", "AuthorID": "57219196698", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Department of Civil, Environment & Geomatic Engineering"}, "6603460664": {"Name": "Buldakov E.", "AuthorID": "6603460664", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Department of Civil, Environment & Geomatic Engineering"}, "37119653800": {"Name": "Simons R.", "AuthorID": "37119653800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Department of Civil, Environment & Geomatic Engineering"}, "16234762600": {"Name": "Stagonas D.", "AuthorID": "16234762600", "AffiliationID": "60071343", "AffiliationName": "University of Cyprus, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering"}}}
