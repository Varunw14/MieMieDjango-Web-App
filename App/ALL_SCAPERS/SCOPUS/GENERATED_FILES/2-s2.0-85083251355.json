Recently, alloy nanoparticles have been shown as potential candidate for multimodal therapy and imaging of cancer. In the present study, a novel pH responsive poly-l-lysine coated Fe3O4@FePt core shell nanoparticles have been developed for mitochondria targeted (Mito-PANPs) therapy of glioblastoma. The surface of synthesized nanoparticles was modified with mitochondria directing triphenylphsphonium ion (TPP) and hypoxic cancer cell directing protein chlorotoxin (CTX). An attempt has been made to provide multimodal therapy of GBM by targeting hypoxic tissue in combination with chemotherapeutic agent and chemo-photothermal therapy. The synthesized nanoconjugates were extensively characterized and evaluated. The obtained results demonstrated enhanced localization of mitochondria both in vitro and in vivo. A superior proliferation suppressing ability was observed via multiple molecular mechanism involving disruption in mitochondrial energetics. Considering the mitochondria targeting ability, along with specificity for glioma cells and hypoxic region of glioma, multimodal therapeutic approach (chemotherapy, ROS generation by Fe, photothermal therapy, radiotherapy and DNA strand breakage by Pt) and pH responsive drug release, Mito-PANPs can prove to be a promising nanotheranostic platform for tumor imaging and therapy with externally guided monitoring.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Complex I, II, III, IV", "Lutetium", "Mitochondrial ATP", "Multimodal approach", "U87"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alloy nanoparticle", "Biomedical applications", "Chemotherapeutic agents", "Heterogeneous surface", "Inorganic materials", "Molecular mechanism", "Photothermal therapy", "Ros generations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083251355", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"55966624800": {"Name": "Pandey A.", "AuthorID": "55966624800", "AffiliationID": "60003299, 60016524", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, Manipal College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Manipal Academy of Higher Education"}, "16744781100": {"Name": "Sawant K.", "AuthorID": "16744781100", "AffiliationID": "60002112", "AffiliationName": "Drug Delivery Research Laboratory, Centre of Relevance and Excellence in NDDS, Faculty of Pharmacy, The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda"}, "57199490907": {"Name": "Singh K.", "AuthorID": "57199490907", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Division of Biosciences, Anatomy Building, University College London"}, "55550840300": {"Name": "Singh R.", "AuthorID": "55550840300", "AffiliationID": "60002112", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda"}, "8589772200": {"Name": "Subramanian S.", "AuthorID": "8589772200", "AffiliationID": "60033473", "AffiliationName": "Radiopharmaceuticals Division, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre"}, "9840716900": {"Name": "Korde A.", "AuthorID": "9840716900", "AffiliationID": "60019311", "AffiliationName": "Radioisotope Products and Radiation Technology Section, International Atomic Energy Agency"}}}
