Random Structures & Algorithms published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.A well-known result of R\u00f6dl and Ruci\u0144ski states that for any graph H there exists a constant C such that if (Formula presented.), then the random graph Gn, p is a.a.s. H-Ramsey, that is, any 2-coloring of its edges contains a monochromatic copy of H. Aside from a few simple exceptions, the corresponding 0-statement also holds, that is, there exists c > 0 such that whenever (Formula presented.) the random graph Gn, p is a.a.s. not H-Ramsey. We show that near this threshold, even when Gn, p is not H-Ramsey, it is often extremely close to being H-Ramsey. More precisely, we prove that for any constant c > 0 and any strictly 2-balanced graph H, if (Formula presented.), then the random graph Gn, p a.a.s. has the property that every 2-edge-coloring without monochromatic copies of H cannot be extended to an H-free coloring after (Formula presented.) extra random edges are added. This generalizes a result by Friedgut, Kohayakawa, R\u00f6dl, Ruci\u0144ski, and Tetali, who in 2002 proved the same statement for triangles, and addresses a question raised by those authors. We also extend a result of theirs on the three-color case and show that these theorems need not hold when H is not strictly 2-balanced.", "AuthorKeywords": ["positional games", "Ramsey theory", "random graphs"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092675481", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"17433337400": {"Name": "Conlon D.", "AuthorID": "17433337400", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, California Institute of Technology"}, "55585686900": {"Name": "Das S.", "AuthorID": "55585686900", "AffiliationID": "60030718", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Mathematik, Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin"}, "35318287000": {"Name": "M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros T.", "AuthorID": "35318287000", "AffiliationID": "60030718", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Mathematik, Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin"}, "57093209000": {"Name": "Lee J.", "AuthorID": "57093209000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
