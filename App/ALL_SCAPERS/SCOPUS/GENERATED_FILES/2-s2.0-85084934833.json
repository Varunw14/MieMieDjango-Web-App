Published by Oxford University Press.Choosing actions that result in advantageous outcomes is a fundamental function of nervous systems. All computational decision-making models contain a mechanism that controls the variability of (or confidence in) action selection, but its neural implementation is unclear-especially in humans. We investigated this mechanism using two influential decision-making frameworks: Active inference (AI) and reinforcement learning (RL). In AI, the precision (inverse variance) of beliefs about policies controls action selection variability-similar to decision 'noise' parameters in RL- A nd is thought to be encoded by striatal dopamine signaling. We tested this hypothesis by administering a 'go/no-go' task to 75 healthy participants, and measuring striatal dopamine 2/3 receptor (D2/3R) availability in a subset (n = 25) using [11C]-(+)-PHNO positron emission tomography. In behavioral model comparison, RL performed best across the whole group but AI performed best in participants performing above chance levels. Limbic striatal D2/3R availability had linear relationships with AI policy precision (P = 0.029) as well as with RL irreducible decision 'noise' (P = 0.020), and this relationship with D2/3R availability was confirmed with a 'decision stochasticity' factor that aggregated across both models (P = 0.0006). These findings are consistent with occupancy of inhibitory striatal D2/3Rs decreasing the variability of action selection in humans.", "AuthorKeywords": ["action selection", "active inference", "decision temperature", "dopamine 2/3 receptors", "go no-go task", "reinforcement learning"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084934833", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"7403935120": {"Name": "Adams R.A.", "AuthorID": "7403935120", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "57216839308": {"Name": "Lewis D.", "AuthorID": "57216839308", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60109771", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "57216840476": {"Name": "Illingworth B.", "AuthorID": "57216840476", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60109771", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "8501341500": {"Name": "Roiser J.P.", "AuthorID": "8501341500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60109771", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "56785597500": {"Name": "Nour M.M.", "AuthorID": "56785597500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), King's College London"}, "57199081751": {"Name": "Dahoun T.", "AuthorID": "57199081751", "AffiliationID": "60000940, 60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Warneford Hospital"}, "6602176923": {"Name": "Howes O.D.", "AuthorID": "6602176923", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), King's College London"}, "6603657495": {"Name": "Moutoussis M.", "AuthorID": "6603657495", "AffiliationID": "60122566", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck-UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research"}, "36080215500": {"Name": "Friston K.J.", "AuthorID": "36080215500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "24068820700": {"Name": "Mathys C.", "AuthorID": "24068820700", "AffiliationID": "60012614, 60025858", "AffiliationName": "Translational Neuromodeling Unit (TNU), Institute for Biomedical Engineering, University of Zurich, ETH Zurich"}, "12781497100": {"Name": "Guitart-Masip M.", "AuthorID": "12781497100", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Aging Research Center, Karolinska Institute"}, "36487315800": {"Name": "Veronese M.", "AuthorID": "36487315800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuroimaging Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), King's College London"}, "56397878100": {"Name": "De Boer L.", "AuthorID": "56397878100", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Aging Research Center, Karolinska Institute"}}}
