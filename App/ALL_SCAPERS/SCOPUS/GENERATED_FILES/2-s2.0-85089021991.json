In response, residents\u2019 groups and public planners have sometimes sought to prioritise \u2018local needs\u2019, restricting the occupancy of new housing to key workers or others deemed \u2018local\u2019. Drawing on examples from England, this paper illustrates how these down-stream interventions are often rendered ineffective by the upstream and structural drivers of housing access inequality, revealing a need for up-stream reforms focused on community control of land and the tax treatment of housing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["domestic property classes", "England", "planning intervention", "Rural housing", "tax and land reform"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089021991", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"]], "AuthorData": {"6701406723": {"Name": "Gallent N.", "AuthorID": "6701406723", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Planning, University College London"}, "55357195400": {"Name": "Hamiduddin I.", "AuthorID": "55357195400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Planning, University College London"}, "57205656537": {"Name": "Kelsey J.", "AuthorID": "57205656537", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Construction and Project Management, University College London"}, "57201277201": {"Name": "Stirling P.", "AuthorID": "57201277201", "AffiliationID": "60120026, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Centre for Housing and Planning Research, Department of Land Economy, University of Cambridge"}}}
