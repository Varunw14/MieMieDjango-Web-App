Additional device flexibility comes with the inherent ability to attain freeform shapes, expanding the possible fabrication methods, applications and retro-fitting techniques. Unfortunately, flexible LSCs suffer from curvature induced losses which can severely reduce their efficiency, inhibiting the potential of large-scale devices. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate an all-silicone based flexible LSC and Distributed Bragg Reflector (DBR) combination diminishing curvature induced losses. The DBRs, fabricated using scalable solution-based processes, exhibit optical properties precisely engineered to partner our LSCs, as well as high uniformity, resistance to temperature and curvature. Comprehensive modelling shows that for large-scale devices (1 m2) we can essentially decouple the performance of the LSC from curvature, steering the technology towards commercial viability.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Distributed Bragg reflectors", "Flexible devices", "Luminescent solar concentrators", "Solar energy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Commercial viability", "Fabrication method", "Fitting techniques", "Flexible device", "High uniformity", "Luminescent solar concentrators", "Scalable solution", "Seamless integration"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078665603", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57192707503": {"Name": "Portnoi M.", "AuthorID": "57192707503", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Photonic Innovations Lab, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57188690319": {"Name": "Sol C.", "AuthorID": "57188690319", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Photonic Innovations Lab, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57205576651": {"Name": "Robbins T.S.", "AuthorID": "57205576651", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Photonic Innovations Lab, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57198839849": {"Name": "Li T.", "AuthorID": "57198839849", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Photonic Innovations Lab, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55639855600": {"Name": "Schl\u00e4fer J.", "AuthorID": "55639855600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Photonic Innovations Lab, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "8306417100": {"Name": "Papakonstantinou I.", "AuthorID": "8306417100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Photonic Innovations Lab, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56210619300": {"Name": "Macdonald T.J.", "AuthorID": "56210619300", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "25927105300": {"Name": "Guldin S.", "AuthorID": "25927105300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
