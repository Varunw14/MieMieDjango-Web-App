However, whether the associated benefits are similar for all countries is unclear. In this paper, an EU27 multiregional input-output model, at a sector level to identify the inter-regional and -sectoral CWE flows, and clarify the regional, sectoral and worldwide patterns of EU27 CWE network is presented. The results revealed an environmental inequality across the EU27 and impacts on the rest of the world. The EU27 countries contributed 1.4 Gt less CO2 emissions, 64.5 Gm3 less water utilisation and 49 EJ less energy consumption, compared to the rest of the world while generating the equivalent economic output in 2014. This has dramatic effects upon the global environment. Germany, France and Italy are the biggest beneficiaries in the CWE nexus in the EU27. It is recommended that the EU27 provide more technical support to upstream countries in the EU and elsewhere to strive to improve their resource utilisation efficiencies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carbon-water-energy flows", "Embodied CO2", "Embodied energy", "Embodied water", "EU27", "Input-output model"], "IndexKeywords": ["CO2 emissions", "Economic output", "Global environment", "Global patterns", "Input output model", "Resource utilisation", "Technical support", "Water energy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095880873", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"]], "AuthorData": {"57203387258": {"Name": "Wang X.C.", "AuthorID": "57203387258", "AffiliationID": "60108596, 60013826", "AffiliationName": "Sustainable Process Integration Laboratory - SPIL, NETME Centre, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Brno University of Technology - VUT Brno"}, "56903012000": {"Name": "Kleme\u0161 J.J.", "AuthorID": "56903012000", "AffiliationID": "60108596, 60013826", "AffiliationName": "Sustainable Process Integration Laboratory - SPIL, NETME Centre, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Brno University of Technology - VUT Brno"}, "6603469420": {"Name": "Varbanov P.S.", "AuthorID": "6603469420", "AffiliationID": "60108596, 60013826", "AffiliationName": "Sustainable Process Integration Laboratory - SPIL, NETME Centre, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Brno University of Technology - VUT Brno"}, "35207058700": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "35207058700", "AffiliationID": "60009860", "AffiliationName": "Fudan Tyndall Center and Shanghai Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Particle Pollution and Prevention (LAP3), Department of Environmental Science & Engineering, Fudan University"}, "35223180000": {"Name": "Foley A.", "AuthorID": "35223180000", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Structural & Environmental Engineering, Trinity College Dublin, University of Dublin"}, "55944703800": {"Name": "Huisingh D.", "AuthorID": "55944703800", "AffiliationID": "60015574", "AffiliationName": "The Institute for a Secure and Sustainable Environment, The University of Tennessee"}, "15839411900": {"Name": "Guan D.", "AuthorID": "15839411900", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London"}, "10138958700": {"Name": "Dong X.", "AuthorID": "10138958700", "AffiliationID": "60023237", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology, Faculty of Geographical Science, Beijing Normal University"}}}
