We discuss our experience in managing a patient with extensive squamous cell carcinoma of the right face and scalp under the TPCS2a-based bleomycin PCI treatment protocol. In this case, an 84-year-old Caucasian received 0.25 mg kg\u22121 of TPCS2a (Amphinex\u00ae, PCI Biotech AS, Oslo, Norway). Surface illumination photochemical internalization was carried out after 4 days, which was preceded by the chemotherapeutic agent infusion (Bleomycin). After one week from the illumination time, tissue necrosis was evident and tumor shrinkage was most noticeable at day 14 postillumination. Follow-up at 6 weeks continued to show tissue healing and regeneration with no clinical evidence of recurrence. Multiple surgical biopsies were taken at 1 and 3 months postillumination and found to be tumor free. PCI\u2019s depth of effect has been very significant with negligible damage to the collateral tissues. This technology has a role in interventional oncology especially when managing challenging cases.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081746237", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"14829051500": {"Name": "Jerjes W.", "AuthorID": "14829051500", "AffiliationID": "100479455", "AffiliationName": "North End Medical Centre"}, "57210771475": {"Name": "Hopper C.", "AuthorID": "57210771475", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Unit of OMFS, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "33667570900": {"Name": "Hamdoon Z.", "AuthorID": "33667570900", "AffiliationID": "60070813", "AffiliationName": "College of Dental Medicine, University of Sharjah"}, "7401938257": {"Name": "Berg K.", "AuthorID": "7401938257", "AffiliationID": "60105037", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Biology, Oslo University Hospital, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "6701642540": {"Name": "H\u00f8gset A.", "AuthorID": "6701642540", "AffiliationID": "101902073", "AffiliationName": "PCI Biotech AS"}}}
