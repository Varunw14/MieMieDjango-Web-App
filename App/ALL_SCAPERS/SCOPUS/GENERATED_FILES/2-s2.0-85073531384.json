Thus far the majority of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies focused on enhanced geothermal plants. However, conventional geothermal plants that harness hydrothermal reservoirs dominate the production of electricity from geothermal energy worldwide. This article focuses on Hellishei\u00f0i, a combined heat and power double flash geothermal plant located in Iceland, with an installed capacity of 303.3 MW of electricity and 133 MW of hot water. The study has a twofold goal: (i) identify hot spots in the life cycle and, where possible, suggest improvements, and (ii) understand the potential of geothermal energy to decarbonise the power generation industry. First, a detailed LCA study has been performed on Hellishei\u00f0i, with cradle-to-grave system boundaries and detailed site-specific data obtained from the literature. The analysis identifies consumption of diesel for drilling and use of steel for wells casing and construction of the power plant as the main hot spots. Second, carbon intensities of electricity production for various possible configurations of the Hellishei\u00f0i power plant (including single flash, and power-only production) have been compared with those of other geothermal plants and other energy sources. Different allocation procedures have been used to allocate impacts between electricity and hot water where necessary, and Monte Carlo simulations have been used to estimate uncertainties of Hellishei\u00f0i's carbon intensities. The comparison shows that the carbon intensity of Hellishei\u00f0i is in the range of 15\u201324 g CO2-eq./kWh, which is similar to those of binary cycle geothermal plants, solar (photovoltaic) and hydropower, lower than other geothermal technologies and fossil-based technologies, and higher than nuclear and onshore wind.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carbon intensity", "Environmental impacts", "Geothermal energy", "Life Cycle Assessment", "Uncertainty analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carbon intensity", "Combined heat and power", "Electricity production", "Installed capacity", "Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)", "Power generation industries", "Renewable energies", "System boundary", "Carbon", "Electricity", "Environment", "Geothermal Energy", "Power Plants"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073531384", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"]], "AuthorData": {"57203864325": {"Name": "Paulillo A.", "AuthorID": "57203864325", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "6602824221": {"Name": "Striolo A.", "AuthorID": "6602824221", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "35572355100": {"Name": "Lettieri P.", "AuthorID": "35572355100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
