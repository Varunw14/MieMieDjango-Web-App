Rendering parameters directly influence the quality of rendered images. The purpose of this work is to study the influence of two of these parameters (voxel dimension in z direction and sampling distance) on DBT rendered data. Both parameters were studied with a real phantom and one clinical DBT data set. The voxel size was changed from 0.085 \u00d7 0.085 \u00d7 1.0 mm3 to 0.085 \u00d7 0.085 \u00d7 0.085 mm3 using ten interpolation functions available in the Visualization Toolkit library (VTK) and several sampling distance values were evaluated. The results were investigated at 90\u00bausing volume rendering visualization with composite technique. For phantom quantitative analysis, degree of smoothness, contrast-to-noise ratio, and full width at half maximum of a Gaussian curve fitted to the profile of one disk were used. Additionally, the time required for each visualization was also recorded. Hamming interpolation function presented the best compromise in image quality. The sampling distance values that showed a better balance between time and image quality were 0.025 mm and 0.05 mm. With the appropriate rendering parameters, a significant improvement in rendered images was achieved.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Breast tomosynthesis", "Visualization", "Volume rendering"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091416176", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56650667300": {"Name": "Mota A.M.", "AuthorID": "56650667300", "AffiliationID": "60002769, 60106051", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Biof\u00edsica e Engenharia Biom\u00e9dica, Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias, Universidade de Lisboa"}, "7102848121": {"Name": "Almeida P.", "AuthorID": "7102848121", "AffiliationID": "60002769, 60106051", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Biof\u00edsica e Engenharia Biom\u00e9dica, Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias, Universidade de Lisboa"}, "6508224428": {"Name": "Matela N.", "AuthorID": "6508224428", "AffiliationID": "60002769, 60106051", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Biof\u00edsica e Engenharia Biom\u00e9dica, Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias, Universidade de Lisboa"}, "7006920406": {"Name": "Clarkson M.J.", "AuthorID": "7006920406", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}}}
