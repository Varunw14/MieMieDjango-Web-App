However, studies of the neuraxis with advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are rare because of long acquisition times. We investigated neurodegeneration in MS brain and cervical spinal cord using neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI). Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate possible alterations, and their clinical relevance, in neurite morphology along the brain and cervical spinal cord of relapsing\u2013remitting MS (RRMS) patients. Methods: In total, 28 RRMS patients and 20 healthy controls (HCs) underwent brain and spinal cord NODDI at 3T. Physical and cognitive disability was assessed. Individual maps of orientation dispersion index (ODI) and neurite density index (NDI) in brain and spinal cord were obtained. We examined differences in NODDI measures between groups and the relationships between NODDI metrics and clinical scores using linear regression models adjusted for age, sex and brain tissue volumes or cord cross-sectional area (CSA). Results: Patients showed lower NDI in the brain normal-appearing white matter (WM) and spinal cord WM than HCs. In patients, a lower NDI in the spinal cord WM was associated with higher disability. Conclusion: Reduced neurite density occurs in the neuraxis but, especially when affecting the spinal cord, it may represent a mechanism of disability in MS.", "AuthorKeywords": ["axonal loss", "diffusion-weighted MRI", "Multiple sclerosis", "NODDI", "quantitative MRI", "relapsing\u2013remitting"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074826938", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56009626100": {"Name": "Collorone S.", "AuthorID": "56009626100", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148, 60176027", "AffiliationName": "NMR Research Unit, Queen Square Multiple Sclerosis Centre, Department of Neuroinflammation, UCL Institute of Neurology, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London (UCL)"}, "35770193900": {"Name": "Cawley N.", "AuthorID": "35770193900", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148, 60176027", "AffiliationName": "NMR Research Unit, Queen Square Multiple Sclerosis Centre, Department of Neuroinflammation, UCL Institute of Neurology, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London (UCL)"}, "57220397875": {"Name": "Tona F.", "AuthorID": "57220397875", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148, 60176027", "AffiliationName": "NMR Research Unit, Queen Square Multiple Sclerosis Centre, Department of Neuroinflammation, UCL Institute of Neurology, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London (UCL)"}, "7404597283": {"Name": "Thompson A.J.", "AuthorID": "7404597283", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148, 60176027", "AffiliationName": "NMR Research Unit, Queen Square Multiple Sclerosis Centre, Department of Neuroinflammation, UCL Institute of Neurology, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London (UCL)"}, "6602459234": {"Name": "Toosy A.", "AuthorID": "6602459234", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148, 60176027", "AffiliationName": "NMR Research Unit, Queen Square Multiple Sclerosis Centre, Department of Neuroinflammation, UCL Institute of Neurology, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London (UCL)"}, "56512026600": {"Name": "Grussu F.", "AuthorID": "56512026600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC), Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "57193550334": {"Name": "Prados F.", "AuthorID": "57193550334", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC), Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "55624877900": {"Name": "Calvi A.", "AuthorID": "55624877900", "AffiliationID": "60030318, 60007067", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathophysiology and Transplantation, Neurodegenerative Disease Unit, La Fondazione IRCCS Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Mangiagalli e Regina Elena, University of Milan"}, "55883085700": {"Name": "Kanber B.", "AuthorID": "55883085700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC), Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "36088339000": {"Name": "Zhang H.", "AuthorID": "36088339000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC), Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7402830766": {"Name": "Alexander D.C.", "AuthorID": "7402830766", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC), Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "36622407700": {"Name": "Schneider T.", "AuthorID": "36622407700", "AffiliationID": "115905398", "AffiliationName": "Philips UK"}, "57194202767": {"Name": "Kipp L.", "AuthorID": "57194202767", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Stanford MS Center, Department of Neurology Neurological Sciences, Stanford University"}, "6602501665": {"Name": "Wheeler-Kingshott C.A.G.", "AuthorID": "6602501665", "AffiliationID": "60083543", "AffiliationName": "Brain MRI 3T Research Centre, IRCCS Mondino Foundation"}, "7003671038": {"Name": "Ciccarelli O.", "AuthorID": "7003671038", "AffiliationID": "60172638, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre"}}}
