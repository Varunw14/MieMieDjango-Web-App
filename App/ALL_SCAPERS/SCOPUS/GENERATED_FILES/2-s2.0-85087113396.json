American Journal of Transplantation published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant SurgeonsCRADLE was a 36-month multicenter study in pediatric (\u22651 to <18 years) kidney transplant recipients randomized at 4 to 6 weeks posttransplant to receive everolimus + reduced-exposure tacrolimus (EVR + rTAC; n = 52) with corticosteroid withdrawal at 6-month posttransplant or continue mycophenolate mofetil + standard-exposure TAC (MMF + sTAC; n = 54) with corticosteroids. The incidence of composite efficacy failure (biopsy-proven acute rejection [BPAR], graft loss, or death) at month 36 was 9.8% vs 9.6% (difference: 0.2%; 80% confidence interval: \u22127.3 to 7.7) for EVR + rTAC and MMF + sTAC, respectively, which was driven by BPARs. Graft loss was low (2.1% vs 3.8%) with no deaths. Mean estimated glomerular filtration rate at month 36 was comparable between groups (68.1 vs 67.3 mL/min/1.73 m2). Mean changes (z-score) in height (0.72 vs 0.39; P =.158) and weight (0.61 vs 0.82; P =.453) from randomization to month 36 were comparable, whereas growth in prepubertal patients on EVR + rTAC was better (P =.050) vs MMF + sTAC. The overall incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs was comparable between groups. Rejection was the leading AE for study drug discontinuation in the EVR + rTAC group. In conclusion, though AE-related study drug discontinuation was higher, an EVR + rTAC regimen represents an alternative treatment option that enables withdrawal of steroids as well as reduction of CNIs for pediatric kidney transplant recipients.
