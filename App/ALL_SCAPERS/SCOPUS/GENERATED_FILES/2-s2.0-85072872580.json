Unlike other computer vision systems used in dementia stage assessment such as RGB-D video with the aid of depth camera, activities of daily living (ADL) monitored by information and communication technologies (ICT) facilities, or X-Ray, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images fed to machine learning algorithms, the system developed here focuses on analysing the sign language space envelope (sign trajectories/depth/speed) and facial expression of deaf individuals, using normal 2D videos. In this work, we are interested in providing a more accurate segmentation of objects of interest in relation to the background, so that accurate real-time hand trajectories (path of the trajectory and speed) can be achieved. The paper presents and evaluates two types of hand movement trajectory models. In the first model, the hand sign trajectory is tracked by implementing skin colour segmentation. In the second model, the hand sign trajectory is tracked using Part Affinity Fields based on the OpenPose Skeleton Model [1, 2]. Comparisons of results between the two different models demonstrate that the second model provides enhanced improvements in terms of tracking accuracy and robustness of tracking. The pattern differences in facial and trajectory motion data achieved from the presented models will be beneficial not only for screening of deaf individuals for dementia, but also for assessment of other acquired neurological impairments associated with motor changes, for example, stroke and Parkinson\u2019s disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dementia", "Hand tracking", "OpenPose", "Segmentation", "Sign language", "Time-series data analytics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dementia", "Hand tracking", "OpenPose", "Sign language", "Time-series data"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072872580", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57208262641": {"Name": "Liang X.", "AuthorID": "57208262641", "AffiliationID": "60000508", "AffiliationName": "Cognitive Computing Research Lab, University of Westminster"}, "6603546263": {"Name": "Kapetanios E.", "AuthorID": "6603546263", "AffiliationID": "60000508", "AffiliationName": "Cognitive Computing Research Lab, University of Westminster"}, "13605902500": {"Name": "Angelopoulou A.", "AuthorID": "13605902500", "AffiliationID": "60000508", "AffiliationName": "Cognitive Computing Research Lab, University of Westminster"}, "7004344871": {"Name": "Woll B.", "AuthorID": "7004344871", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Deafness Cognition and Language Research Centre, University College London"}}}
