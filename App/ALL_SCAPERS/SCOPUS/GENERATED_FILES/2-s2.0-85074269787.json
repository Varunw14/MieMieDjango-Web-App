Taking the unique Finnish leave scheme as a case example, this article examines fathers\u2019 motivations and barriers to leave. Although research on fathers\u2019 take-up of leave in divergent leave policy contexts has increased dramatically, fathers\u2019 motivations and barriers to leave have remained underresearched. The article reports on a survey sample of 852 Finnish fathers of infants who were taking paternity, parental, and other forms of leave, drawn from the Population Register Center. Results show that less than 20% of fathers report taking no leave, with more than 80% taking some form of leave. A multinomial logistic regression analysis indicates that father\u2019s work, partner\u2019s education, and family income, along with father\u2019s wish to take a break from work and wish to facilitate mother\u2019s return to work or studies, are the key characteristics and motivations associated with fathers\u2019 take-up of leave. The most common barriers to fathers\u2019 take-up of leave were related to the family\u2019s economic situation and the father\u2019s job. It is suggested that decreasing maternalism in the leave scheme, by extending investment in fathers\u2019 individual well-paid leave weeks, will also help promote greater gender equality for working parents in Finland following the path of Nordic neighbors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["fatherhood", "Finland", "parental leave", "paternity leave"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074269787", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"56261858000": {"Name": "Eerola P.", "AuthorID": "56261858000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57190298386": {"Name": "O\u2019Brien M.", "AuthorID": "57190298386", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56543515500": {"Name": "Lammi-Taskula J.", "AuthorID": "56543515500", "AffiliationID": "60104546", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health and Welfare"}, "57220004832": {"Name": "Hietam\u00e4ki J.", "AuthorID": "57220004832", "AffiliationID": "60104546", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health and Welfare"}, "54684913100": {"Name": "R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen E.", "AuthorID": "54684913100", "AffiliationID": "60032398", "AffiliationName": "University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4"}}}
