Objective: This study examined the effects of inhibitory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of prefrontal cortex on recognition memory in AD patients. Methods: In a first experiment, 24 mild AD patients received sham and real 1Hz rTMS over the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), in different sessions, between encoding and retrieval phases of a non-verbal recognition memory task. In a second experiment, another group of 14 AD patients underwent sham controlled repeated sessions of 1Hz rTMS of the right DLPFC across a two week treatment. Non-verbal recognition memory task was performed at baseline, at the end of the two weeks period and at a follow up of 1 month. Results: Right real rTMS significantly improved memory performance compared to right sham rTMS (p = 0.001). Left real rTMS left the memory performance unchanged as compared with left sham rTMS (p = 0.46). The two sham conditions did not differ between each other (p = 0.24). In the second experiment, AD patients treated with real rTMS showed an improvement of memory performance at the end of the two weeks treatment (p = 0.0009), that persisted at 1-month follow-up (p = 0.002). Conclusion: These findings provide evidence that inhibitory rTMS over the right DLPFC can improve recognition memory function in AD patients. They also suggest the importance of a new approach of non-invasive brain stimulation as a promising treatment in AD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Prefrontal cortex", "Recognition memory", "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aging", "Alzheimer Disease", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Memory Disorders", "Memory, Episodic", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Psychomotor Performance", "Recognition, Psychology", "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075813077", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"6602456612": {"Name": "Turriziani P.", "AuthorID": "6602456612", "AffiliationID": "60017697", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Educational Science and Human Movement, University of Palermo"}, "6507588275": {"Name": "Smirni D.", "AuthorID": "6507588275", "AffiliationID": "60017697", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Educational Science and Human Movement, University of Palermo"}, "36137414400": {"Name": "Mangano G.R.", "AuthorID": "36137414400", "AffiliationID": "60017697", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Educational Science and Human Movement, University of Palermo"}, "7007025909": {"Name": "Oliveri M.", "AuthorID": "7007025909", "AffiliationID": "60017697", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Educational Science and Human Movement, University of Palermo"}, "7004699081": {"Name": "Zappal\u00e0 G.", "AuthorID": "7004699081", "AffiliationID": "112598493", "AffiliationName": "Unit\u00e0 di Neurologia Cognitiva e Riabilitazione, ARNAS Garibaldi"}, "57210725656": {"Name": "Giustiniani A.", "AuthorID": "57210725656", "AffiliationID": "60017697", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Educational Science and Human Movement, University of Palermo"}, "7004532494": {"Name": "Cipolotti L.", "AuthorID": "7004532494", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropsychology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
