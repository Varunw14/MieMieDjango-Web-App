All rights reserved.An extensive literature opposes the provision of property titles in informal settlements. One concern is that titling leads to commodification and the market-driven displacement of the original inhabitants. Another is that it propagates the ideology of private ownership, undermines collective solidarity and demobilises social movements. This article, based on observations from Mexico City and Guadalajara, finds little evidence of displacement but highlights the importance of location. It supports the view that formalisation undermines resistance, but argues that titling does so by meeting rather than creating the desire of the urban poor for private property and homeownership.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Displacement", "Gentrification", "Informality", "Property", "Titling"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079387268", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"7003869242": {"Name": "Varley A.", "AuthorID": "7003869242", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Geograf\u00eda, UCL (University College London)"}}}
