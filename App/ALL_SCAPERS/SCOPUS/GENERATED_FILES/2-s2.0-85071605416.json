Yet 3GAT has known limits, and these limits are making it difficult to model, assess, and make recommendations for such cases. In this paper, we discuss these limitations, then overview and synthesize recent research pointing to a fourth generation of activity (4GAT). We find that this literature has two main foci: (1) Peer and social production and (2) Networked organization of labor and production. We conclude by offering implications for professional communication.", "AuthorKeywords": ["4GAT", "CHAT", "cultural historical activity theory", "Fourth generation activity theory"], "IndexKeywords": ["4GAT", "Activity Theory", "CHAT", "Literature reviews", "Networked organizations", "Professional communication", "Recent researches", "Social productions"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071605416", "SubjectAreas": [["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"6603965682": {"Name": "Spinuzzi C.", "AuthorID": "6603965682", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "University of Texas at Austin"}, "15044497000": {"Name": "Guile D.", "AuthorID": "15044497000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
