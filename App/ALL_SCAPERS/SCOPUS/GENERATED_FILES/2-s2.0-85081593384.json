Conversely, for cardiac muscle, the lack of human preclinical models to inform target validation and compound development has likely contributed to the perennial problem of clinical trial failures, despite encouraging non-human results. By contrast, human cardiomyocytes produced from pluripotent stem cell models have recently been applied to safety pharmacology, phenotypic screening, target validation and high-throughput assays, facilitating cardiac drug discovery. Here, we review the impact of human pluripotent stem cell models in cardiac drug discovery, discussing the range of applications, readouts, and disease models employed, along with the challenges and prospects to advance this fruitful mode of research further.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081593384", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"]], "AuthorData": {"57207135224": {"Name": "Golforoush P.", "AuthorID": "57207135224", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "7404064103": {"Name": "Schneider M.D.", "AuthorID": "7404064103", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}}}
