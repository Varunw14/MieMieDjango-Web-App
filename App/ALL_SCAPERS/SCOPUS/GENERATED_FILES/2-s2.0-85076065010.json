Children & Society published by National Children\u2019s Bureau and John Wiley & Sons LtdInternationally, research has highlighted disruption to the educational trajectories of young people in care, documenting concern about upheaval and poor educational outcomes. We present findings from English data arising from qualitative longitudinal research with care experienced people (16\u201332 years) who were also in education, employment or training.
