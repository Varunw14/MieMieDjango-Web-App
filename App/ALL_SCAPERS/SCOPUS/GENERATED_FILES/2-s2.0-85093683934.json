Harmonised data from the Ageing Trajectories of Health: Longitudinal Opportunities and Synergies (ATHLOS) project were used. Concretely, the sample comprised 6195 participants (53.95% women; M = 61.30 years, SD = 7.11) from three European cohorts. Three groups were considered: control group (CG); depressive symptom episode group (DEP); and a group with depression and loneliness (DEP + LONE). A metabolic score was estimated using anthropometric and blood indicators, by means of multi-indicator multi-causes (MIMIC) modelling and after controlling for sociodemographic and health-related covariates. Group-comparison was based on measurement-invariance procedures. Multimorbidity development was predicted at follow-up considering the study group and relevant covariates. All the analyses were sex-specific. As a result, measurement invariance revealed the influence of group (\u0394CFI = \u22120.017 for male participants and \u0394CFI = \u22120.009 for female ones) on metabolic scores in both sexes. Metabolic scores were significantly lower (i.e., they had more metabolic risk) in DEP + LONE women in comparison to women from the other groups. DEP men showed the lowest metabolic scores but those from the DEP + LONE group showed meaningfully lower scores than CG men (d = 1.35). In terms of multimorbidity prediction, DEP + LONE group membership significantly predicted the outcome in both sexes; DEP group membership significantly predicted multimorbidity at follow-up in women. In summary, these results highlight the relevant contribution of loneliness in depression-related metabolic dysregulation in the short- (concurrent metabolic risk) and long-term (chronic condition development). Moreover, sex-specific mechanisms seem to be involved in metabolic alterations of depressed people showing loneliness feelings. This study calls for action to reduce the impact of loneliness in old age and to promote healthy ageing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ATHLOS project", "Late-life depression", "Loneliness", "Metabolic dysregulation", "Multimorbidity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85093683934", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"], ["Endocrine and Autonomic Systems", "NEUR", "2807"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"55675442300": {"Name": "de la Torre-Luque A.", "AuthorID": "55675442300", "AffiliationID": "121884730", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n Sanitaria Princesa (IIS Princesa)"}, "56338906400": {"Name": "Lara E.", "AuthorID": "56338906400", "AffiliationID": "60026796", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid"}, "57201462206": {"Name": "de la Fuente J.", "AuthorID": "57201462206", "AffiliationID": "60026796", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid"}, "57074105800": {"Name": "Rico-Uribe L.A.", "AuthorID": "57074105800", "AffiliationID": "60026796", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid"}, "14622864000": {"Name": "Lopez-Garcia P.", "AuthorID": "14622864000", "AffiliationID": "60026796", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid"}, "22836101000": {"Name": "Sanchez-Niubo A.", "AuthorID": "22836101000", "AffiliationID": "60001576", "AffiliationName": "Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de D\u00e9u, Fundaci\u00f3 Sant Joan de D\u00e9u, Universitat de Barcelona"}, "57215877903": {"Name": "Haro J.M.", "AuthorID": "57215877903", "AffiliationID": "60001576", "AffiliationName": "Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de D\u00e9u, Fundaci\u00f3 Sant Joan de D\u00e9u, Universitat de Barcelona"}, "7003927709": {"Name": "Ayuso-Mateos J.L.", "AuthorID": "7003927709", "AffiliationID": "60026796", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid"}, "55344309300": {"Name": "Caballero F.F.", "AuthorID": "55344309300", "AffiliationID": "125256476", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomedical Research in Epidemiology and Public Health (CIBERESP)"}, "7005266289": {"Name": "Bobak M.", "AuthorID": "7005266289", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, University College London"}, "57197651958": {"Name": "Koskinen S.", "AuthorID": "57197651958", "AffiliationID": "60104546", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health and Welfare"}}}
