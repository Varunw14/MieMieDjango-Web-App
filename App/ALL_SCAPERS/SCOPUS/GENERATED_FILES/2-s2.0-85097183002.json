It is unclear, however, how sets of polygenic scores, which partly capture environmental effects, perform jointly with sets of environmental measures, which are themselves heritable, in prediction models of educational achievement. Here, for the first time, we systematically investigate gene-environment correlation (rGE) and interaction (GxE) in the joint analysis of multiple genome-wide polygenic scores (GPS) and multiple environmental measures as they predict tested educational achievement (EA). We predict EA in a representative sample of 7,026 16-year-olds, with 20 GPS for psychiatric, cognitive and anthropometric traits, and 13 environments (including life events, home environment, and SES) measured earlier in life. Environmental and GPS predictors were modelled, separately and jointly, in penalized regression models with out-of-sample comparisons of prediction accuracy, considering the implications that their interplay had on model performance. Jointly modelling multiple GPS and environmental factors significantly improved prediction of EA, with cognitive-related GPS adding unique independent information beyond SES, home environment and life events. We found evidence for rGE underlying variation in EA (rGE =.38; 95% CIs =.30,.45). We estimated that 40% (95% CIs = 31%, 50%) of the polygenic scores effects on EA were mediated by environmental effects, and in turn that 18% (95% CIs = 12%, 25%) of environmental effects were accounted for by the polygenic model, indicating genetic confounding. Lastly, we did not find evidence that GxE effects significantly contributed to multivariable prediction. Our multivariable polygenic and environmental prediction model suggests widespread rGE and unsystematic GxE contributions to EA in adolescence.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adolescent Development", "Educational Status", "Female", "Gene-Environment Interaction", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Genotyping Techniques", "Humans", "Male", "Models, Genetic", "Multifactorial Inheritance", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85097183002", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"57200696063": {"Name": "Allegrini A.G.", "AuthorID": "57200696063", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "56661677400": {"Name": "Coleman J.R.I.", "AuthorID": "56661677400", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60171762", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre, King's College London"}, "57185850000": {"Name": "Selzam S.", "AuthorID": "57185850000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "55953973500": {"Name": "Rimfeld K.", "AuthorID": "55953973500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "8369960100": {"Name": "Pingault J.B.", "AuthorID": "8369960100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "57209335477": {"Name": "Plomin R.", "AuthorID": "57209335477", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "57210776128": {"Name": "Karhunen V.", "AuthorID": "57210776128", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Imperial College London"}, "26436419000": {"Name": "von Stumm S.", "AuthorID": "26436419000", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, University of York"}}}
