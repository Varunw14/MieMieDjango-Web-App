Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.Optineurin (OPTN) is a multifunctional protein involved in autophagy and secretion, as well as nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and IRF3 signalling, and OPTN mutations are associated with several human diseases. Here, we show that, in response to viral RNA, OPTN translocates to foci in the perinuclear region, where it negatively regulates NF-\u03baB and IRF3 signalling pathways and downstream pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. These OPTN foci consist of a tight cluster of small membrane vesicles, which are positive for ATG9A. Disease mutations in OPTN linked to primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) cause aberrant foci formation in the absence of stimuli, which correlates with the ability of OPTN to inhibit signalling. By using proximity labelling proteomics, we identify the linear ubiquitin assembly complex (LUBAC), CYLD and TBK1 as part of the OPTN interactome and show that these proteins are recruited to this OPTN-positive perinuclear compartment. Our work uncovers a crucial role for OPTN in dampening NF-\u03baB and IRF3 signalling through the sequestration of LUBAC and other positive regulators in this viral RNA-induced compartment, leading to altered pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ATG9A", "BioID", "Functional proteomics", "IFN", "Linear ubiquitin", "LUBAC", "NF-\u03baB", "OPTN", "TBK1"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086524291", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57204671101": {"Name": "O'Loughlin T.", "AuthorID": "57204671101", "AffiliationID": "60029881", "AffiliationName": null}, "6603590408": {"Name": "Buss F.", "AuthorID": "6603590408", "AffiliationID": "60103296, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Keith Peters Building, University of Cambridge"}, "36664760000": {"Name": "Kruppa A.J.", "AuthorID": "36664760000", "AffiliationID": "60103296, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Keith Peters Building, University of Cambridge"}, "55172112300": {"Name": "Edgar J.R.", "AuthorID": "55172112300", "AffiliationID": "60103296, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Keith Peters Building, University of Cambridge"}, "57217160132": {"Name": "Ribeiro A.L.R.", "AuthorID": "57217160132", "AffiliationID": "106304791", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, University Centre of Par\u00e1"}, "57217159935": {"Name": "Ghannam A.", "AuthorID": "57217159935", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Microbial Diseases, Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "57209873062": {"Name": "Smith A.M.", "AuthorID": "57209873062", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Microbial Diseases, Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}}}
