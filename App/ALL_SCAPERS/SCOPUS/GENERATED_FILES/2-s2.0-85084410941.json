However, large-scale prospective observational data on the application of this treatment in a real-life clinical setting is lacking. Objective: The main objective is to collect data on the clinical application of radioembolization with 90Y resin microspheres to improve the understanding of the impact of this treatment modality in its routine practice setting. Methods: Eligible patients are 18 years or older and receiving radioembolization for primary and secondary liver tumors as part of routine practice, as well as have signed informed consent. Data is collected at baseline, directly after treatment, and at every 3-month follow-up until 24 months or study exit. The primary objective of the Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe Registry for SIR-Spheres Therapy (CIRT) is to observe the clinical application of radioembolization. Secondary objectives include safety, effectiveness in terms of overall survival, progression-free survival (PFS), liver-specific PFS, imaging response, and change in quality of life. Results: Between January 2015 and December 2017, 1047 patients were included in the study. The 24-month follow-up period ended in December 2019. The first results are expected in the third quarter of 2020. Conclusions: The CIRT is the largest observational study on radioembolization to date and will provide valuable insights to the clinical application of this treatment modality and its real-life outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084410941", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"20734004300": {"Name": "Helmberger T.", "AuthorID": "20734004300", "AffiliationID": "60007047", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Neuroradiology and Minimal-Invasive Therapy, Klinikum Bogenhausen"}, "8223509900": {"Name": "Arnold D.", "AuthorID": "8223509900", "AffiliationID": "60012048", "AffiliationName": "Oncology and Hematology, Asklepios Tumorzentrum Hamburg, Asklepios Klinik Altona"}, "7101601138": {"Name": "Bilbao J.I.", "AuthorID": "7101601138", "AffiliationID": "60033320", "AffiliationName": "Interventional Radiology, Clinica Universidad de Navarra"}, "57216730986": {"Name": "de Jong N.", "AuthorID": "57216730986", "AffiliationID": "60092032", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe"}, "57216730085": {"Name": "Walk A.", "AuthorID": "57216730085", "AffiliationID": "60092032", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe"}, "56998940600": {"Name": "Maleux G.", "AuthorID": "56998940600", "AffiliationID": "60031069", "AffiliationName": "Radiologie, Universitair Ziekenhuis Leuven"}, "57217443185": {"Name": "Nordlund A.", "AuthorID": "57217443185", "AffiliationID": "106163514", "AffiliationName": "Trial Form Support Aktiebolag"}, "6506395156": {"Name": "Peynircioglu B.", "AuthorID": "6506395156", "AffiliationID": "60020484", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, School of Medicine, Hacettepe University"}, "7004456732": {"Name": "Sangro B.", "AuthorID": "7004456732", "AffiliationID": "60078879", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red Enfermedades Hep\u00e1ticas y Digestivas"}, "7407243601": {"Name": "Sharma R.A.", "AuthorID": "7407243601", "AffiliationID": "60172638, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research University College London, Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, University College London Cancer Institute, University College London"}}}
