The initial material was found to be phase-pure form I which, when heated, produces two endotherms that can be observed by DSC at 162.72 and 219.55\u00b0C. The former was found to correspond to a solid-solid enantiotropic transition from form I to a mixture of forms II and III. The latter is the melting point of form II. As form I is heated, significantly greater unit-cell expansion is seen in the a direction than in b and c, which can be explained by the stronger intermolecular interactions in the bc plane. Refinements of the reported MA structures against the patterns collected during heating revealed that at 175\u00b0C there exists a mixture of forms I, II and III, whereas only forms II and III remain at 205\u00b0C. However, reflections are observed at both temperatures which cannot be fitted with the known forms of MA. It is hypothesized that a new form of MA is produced upon heating. The stability of MA after the enantiotropic transition temperature is II > III > I, which differs from the previously reported II > I > III.", "AuthorKeywords": ["differential scanning calorimetry", "hyphenated techniques", "mefenamic acid", "polymorphic transitions", "solid-solid transitions", "synchrotron X-ray diffraction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Hyphenated techniques", "Mefenamic acid", "Polymorphic transitions", "Solid-solid transitions", "Synchrotron x ray diffraction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075792668", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"57220768838": {"Name": "Pang Y.", "AuthorID": "57220768838", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "36020023200": {"Name": "Buanz A.", "AuthorID": "36020023200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "6602683597": {"Name": "Gaisford S.", "AuthorID": "6602683597", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7406083266": {"Name": "Williams G.R.", "AuthorID": "7406083266", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57218240164": {"Name": "Telford R.", "AuthorID": "57218240164", "AffiliationID": "60008524", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry and Biosciences, University of Bradford"}, "35174969300": {"Name": "Magdysyuk O.V.", "AuthorID": "35174969300", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}}}
