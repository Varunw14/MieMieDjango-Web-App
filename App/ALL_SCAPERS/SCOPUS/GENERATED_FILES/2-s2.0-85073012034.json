Therefore, we set out to evaluate the outcome of using a viscoelastic solution (Viscoat) to accelerate the attachment of passaged cultured human corneal endothelial cells (HCEnCs). The cells from 28 donor tissues were isolated using peel-and-digest method and evenly seeded into two wells of an 8-well chamber slide. The cells were left to attach after topical application of Viscoat. At confluence, one well was subjected to end-stage characterization, whereas the other well was passaged into another two wells. The cells at P1 were attached with and without the use of Viscoat. The growth rate was monitored; and at confluence, morphometric analysis, corneal endothelial specific (CD166-Tag1A3 & PRDX6-Tag2A12), mitochondrial and respiration assessment (Tom-20 and Seahorse); function-associated (Na+/K+ATPase & ZO-1); proliferative (Ki-67) marker analysis, and viability (Hoechst, Ethidium Homodimer and Calcein AM-HEC) studies were performed. Cells at P0 (with Viscoat) showed 100% confluence at day 9. Cells at P1 with and without Viscoat showed significant difference of confluence 67.0% v 18.8% respectively (p < 0.05). Confluence rate, cell density, hexagonality, Ki-67 positivity and mitochondrial intensity was significantly higher (p < 0.05), whereas cell-area and polymorphism was significantly lower (p < 0.05) in the cells attached with Viscoat compared with the cells attached without Viscoat. There was no significant difference in oxygen consumption rate between the groups. In conclusion, we observed that acceleration in the attachment of passaged HCEnCs with the assistance of Viscoat, could be beneficial for the propagation of HCEnCs isolated from older donors, to increase their propensity to proliferate, without loss of the expression of vital proteins and heterogeneity in cellular morphology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adherence", "Cornea", "Corneal endothelial cells", "Old donor", "Passage", "Primary cell culture"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Cell Adhesion", "Cell Count", "Cell Culture Techniques", "Cell Proliferation", "Cells, Cultured", "Chondroitin Sulfates", "Drug Combinations", "Endothelium, Corneal", "Female", "Humans", "Hyaluronic Acid", "Male", "Tissue Donors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073012034", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"54795700400": {"Name": "Parekh M.", "AuthorID": "54795700400", "AffiliationID": "60172700", "AffiliationName": "International Center for Ocular Physiopathology, The Veneto Eye Bank Foundation"}, "57197300174": {"Name": "Ramos T.", "AuthorID": "57197300174", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57203480864": {"Name": "Ahmad S.", "AuthorID": "57203480864", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603422101": {"Name": "Ponzin D.", "AuthorID": "6603422101", "AffiliationID": "60172700", "AffiliationName": "International Center for Ocular Physiopathology, The Veneto Eye Bank Foundation"}, "57190211074": {"Name": "Ferrari S.", "AuthorID": "57190211074", "AffiliationID": "60172700", "AffiliationName": "International Center for Ocular Physiopathology, The Veneto Eye Bank Foundation"}, "20434871300": {"Name": "Peh G.", "AuthorID": "20434871300", "AffiliationID": "60095034", "AffiliationName": "Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School"}, "35578098100": {"Name": "Mehta J.S.", "AuthorID": "35578098100", "AffiliationID": "60118453, 60005510, 60031307", "AffiliationName": "School of Material Science and Engineering and School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Nanyang Technological University"}}}
