We demonstrate the creative and transformative ways in which class domination is dealt with and document the prevalence of high-level reflexivity. Furthermore, we distinguish different forms and degrees of reflexivity, which then indicate the \u2018contingency\u2019 of reflexivity\u2013the relation of the possibilities of reflexivity to the unequal distribution of social, cultural and economic capitals. We further argue that what appears to be a form of self-emancipation achieved by the \u2018transcending group\u2019 in our study also involves the discrete and insidious reproduction of social inequality.", "AuthorKeywords": ["contingency of reflexivity", "reflexivity and habitus", "self-emancipation", "working-class \u2018exceptions\u2019", "\u2018toned habitus\u2019"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077668634", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"57207946367": {"Name": "Jin J.", "AuthorID": "57207946367", "AffiliationID": "60021200", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Education, East China Normal University"}, "7202536805": {"Name": "Ball S.J.", "AuthorID": "7202536805", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, Practice and Society, UCL Institute of Education"}}}
