Much of the analysis and discussion focuses on the ways in which intergenerational housing inequalities have deepened over time as young adults' fortunes have deteriorated, most obviously through declining access to homeownership. In this review, we showcase how researchers are harnessing life course theories and rich longitudinal data sets, exploiting longitudinal modelling techniques, and developing new geographical data linkages to enhance our knowledge of a broader range of housing inequalities in young adulthood. We argue that incorporating these longitudinal perspectives more fully into geographical research and teaching will foster an enriched pluralistic model of quantitative human geography that is characterised by collaboration, critical engagement with policy issues, and sensitivity to the strengths and challenges of working in an integrated fashion with varied forms of numerical data.", "AuthorKeywords": ["data structures", "housing", "inequality", "policy", "young people"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078934528", "SubjectAreas": [["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"], ["Computers in Earth Sciences", "EART", "1903"], ["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"]], "AuthorData": {"54392755000": {"Name": "Coulter R.", "AuthorID": "54392755000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}, "57190610607": {"Name": "Bayrakdar S.", "AuthorID": "57190610607", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Education, Communication, and Society, Kings College London"}, "7003849048": {"Name": "Berrington A.", "AuthorID": "7003849048", "AffiliationID": "60025225, 60160416", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Statistics and Demography and ESRC Centre for Population Change, University of Southampton"}}}
