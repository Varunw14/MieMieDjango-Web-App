Approximately 25% of suspected stroke cases are \u201cstroke mimics\u201d and 2% are patients with functional symptoms \u2014\u201cfunctional stroke mimics\u201d. This study aimed to explore experiences and illness perceptions of patients with functional symptoms admitted to hyperacute stroke wards. Methods: This study used mixed methods. Patients with functional stroke symptoms participated in semistructured qualitative interviews immediately after admission to one of two acute-stroke units in London and again 2 months after hospital discharge. Qualitative data were assessed using thematic analysis. The Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (Brief-IPQ) measured illness perceptions at admission and at 2-month follow-up. Results: A total of 36 participants completed baseline interviews and 25 completed followup. Six themes emerged: physical symptom experience, emotional and coping responses, symptom causes, hospital experiences, views on the future, and uncertainty after hospital discharge. Mean Brief-IPQ score at admission was 49.3 (SD: 9.9), indicating a moderate\u2013 high level of perceived illness threat. Participants presented with a range of functional symptoms. At baseline, participants were highly concerned about their symptoms, but this had decreased at 2-month follow-up. Two months later, many were confused as to the cause of their admission. Conclusion: This is the first study to examine functional stroke patients\u2019 experiences of acute-stroke admission. At admission, patients expressed confusion regarding their diagnosis, experienced high levels of emotional distress, and were concerned they were perceived as time wasting by stroke clinicians. While most participants experienced symptom recovery, there was a significant subgroup for whom symptoms persisted or worsened. A lack of care guidelines on the management of functional stroke patients may perpetuate functional symptoms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Functional stroke symptoms", "Qualitative research", "Stroke mimic", "Unexplained medical symptoms"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088579696", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"57214335820": {"Name": "O\u2019connell N.", "AuthorID": "57214335820", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health and Primary Care, School of Medicine, Trinity College Dublin"}, "57213879959": {"Name": "Jones A.", "AuthorID": "57213879959", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "55396153200": {"Name": "Chalder T.", "AuthorID": "55396153200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "57208765987": {"Name": "David A.S.", "AuthorID": "57208765987", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Mental Health, University College London"}}}
