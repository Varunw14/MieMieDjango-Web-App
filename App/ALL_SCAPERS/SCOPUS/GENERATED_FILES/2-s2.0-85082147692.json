Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Across sub-Saharan Africa, key populations with elevated HIV-1 incidence and/or prevalence have been identified, but their contribution to disease spread remains unclear. We performed viral deep-sequence phylogenetic analyses to quantify transmission dynamics between the general population (GP), fisherfolk communities (FF), and women at high risk of infection and their clients (WHR) in central and southwestern Uganda. Between August 2014 and August 2017, 6185 HIV-1 positive individuals were enrolled in 3 GP and 10 FF communities, 3 WHR enrollment sites. A total of 2531 antiretroviral therapy (ART) na\u00efve participants with plasma viral load >1000 copies/mL were deep-sequenced. One hundred and twenty-three transmission networks were reconstructed, including 105 phylogenetically highly supported source-recipient pairs. Only one pair involved a WHR and male participant, suggesting that improved population sampling is needed to assess empirically the role of WHR to the transmission dynamics. More transmissions were observed from the GP communities to FF communities than vice versa, with an estimated flow ratio of 1.56 (95% CrI 0.68-3.72), indicating that fishing communities on Lake Victoria are not a net source of transmission flow to neighboring communities further inland. Men contributed disproportionally to HIV-1 transmission flow regardless of age, suggesting that prevention efforts need to better aid men to engage with and stay in care.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deep sequences", "Human immunodeficiency virus", "Key populations", "Phylogenetic analysis", "Transmission"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082147692", "SubjectAreas": [["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"56304109200": {"Name": "Bbosa N.", "AuthorID": "56304109200", "AffiliationID": "60071671, 60031331", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council (MRC), Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI), London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), Uganda Research Unit"}, "36769305000": {"Name": "Ssemwanga D.", "AuthorID": "36769305000", "AffiliationID": "60071671", "AffiliationName": "Uganda Virus Research Institute"}, "55389241100": {"Name": "Mayanja Y.", "AuthorID": "55389241100", "AffiliationID": "60071671, 60031331", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council (MRC), Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI), London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), Uganda Research Unit"}, "26038965200": {"Name": "Bahemuka U.", "AuthorID": "26038965200", "AffiliationID": "60071671, 60031331", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council (MRC), Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI), London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), Uganda Research Unit"}, "57210784629": {"Name": "Seeley J.", "AuthorID": "57210784629", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM)"}, "16211587900": {"Name": "Kaleebu P.", "AuthorID": "16211587900", "AffiliationID": "60071671", "AffiliationName": "Uganda Virus Research Institute"}, "57215866842": {"Name": "Ssekagiri A.", "AuthorID": "57215866842", "AffiliationID": "60071671", "AffiliationName": "Uganda Virus Research Institute"}, "57215415118": {"Name": "Xi X.", "AuthorID": "57215415118", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Imperial College London"}, "23052436300": {"Name": "Ratmann O.", "AuthorID": "23052436300", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Imperial College London"}, "57216111668": {"Name": "Pillay D.", "AuthorID": "57216111668", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "43560896400": {"Name": "Abeler-D\u00f6rner L.", "AuthorID": "43560896400", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851, 60002634", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Big Data Institute, Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Information and Discovery, Nuffield Department of Medicine, Old Road Campus, University of Oxford"}, "22955370000": {"Name": "Golubchik T.", "AuthorID": "22955370000", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851, 60002634", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Big Data Institute, Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Information and Discovery, Nuffield Department of Medicine, Old Road Campus, University of Oxford"}, "35460815100": {"Name": "Fraser C.", "AuthorID": "35460815100", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851, 60002634", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Big Data Institute, Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Information and Discovery, Nuffield Department of Medicine, Old Road Campus, University of Oxford"}}}
