Background: It is argued that as the needs and expectations of various user groups of healthcare facilities would vary, so would the tools to measure the suitability of the architectural design features of these healing environments for different groups of users. However, a review of relevant literature revealed that there is a dearth of assessment tools to appraise the adequacy of healthcare facilities for nursing staff. Methods: Extant literature was reviewed to construct WEAT. Twenty ward nurses were interviewed to obtain user perspectives on the ward environment. Post-occupancy evaluation of three hospital wards was undertaken to validate and test WEAT. Results: WEAT: A new post-occupancy evaluation tool was created. Conclusions: WEAT measures the impacts of ward environment on nurses in four personal constructs; namely physical, cognitive, sensory and universal. Implications for Nursing Management: WEAT is an innovative management decision-making tool for ward managers, who may use its results to argue for workspace redesign with facilities managers, explore job readjustments with occupational health nurses and review job description with human resource managers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["architectural design features", "hospital ward", "person-environment fit theory", "personal constructs", "post-occupancy evaluation", "ward nurse"], "IndexKeywords": ["Attitude of Health Personnel", "Environment Design", "Humans", "Program Evaluation", "Risk Assessment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082615645", "SubjectAreas": [["Leadership and Management", "NURS", "2911"]], "AuthorData": {"57188670909": {"Name": "Durosaiye I.O.", "AuthorID": "57188670909", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, University of Sheffield"}, "24324895300": {"Name": "Hadjri K.", "AuthorID": "24324895300", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, University of Sheffield"}, "8416232900": {"Name": "Liyanage C.L.", "AuthorID": "8416232900", "AffiliationID": "60031259", "AffiliationName": "University of Central Lancashire"}, "57202862542": {"Name": "Chrysikou E.", "AuthorID": "57202862542", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
