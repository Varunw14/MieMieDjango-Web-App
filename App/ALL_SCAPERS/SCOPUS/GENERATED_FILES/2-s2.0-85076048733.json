All Rights reserved.Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating disease of infants and the commonest gastrointestinal emergency in the newborn period. It is a condition characterised by intestinal necrosis affecting the ileum and/or colon. There is a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. In the least severe cases there may be mild inflammation of the intestinal wall in a baby with mild abdominal distension and minimal systemic upset. The most severely affected cases, however, may show evidence of full thickness intestinal necrosis with perforation, respiratory and cardiovascular collapse, multi-system organ failure and in some cases death.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bell's classification", "Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC)", "Peritoneal drainage", "RCTs", "Staging", "Stomas", "Surgery"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076048733", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"7201554532": {"Name": "Hall N.J.", "AuthorID": "7201554532", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "University Surgery Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "57205586306": {"Name": "Eaton S.", "AuthorID": "57205586306", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme, UCL Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital"}, "7007034902": {"Name": "Pierro A.", "AuthorID": "7007034902", "AffiliationID": "60030319", "AffiliationName": "Division of General and Thoracic Surgery, The Hospital for Sick Children"}}}
