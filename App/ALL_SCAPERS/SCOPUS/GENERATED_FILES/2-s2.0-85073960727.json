Analytical results are provided for the first- and second-order perturbation terms of the free energy for the 2D system. The adsorption model is based on the assumption that the particle pair interactions in the adsorbed and bulk phases are described with the same Mie potential exponents \u03bba and \u03bbr, in contrast with the square-well version of the 2D-SAFT-VR approach in which it is considered necessary to modify the attractive ranges of the SW interactions. This important difference between the two approaches leads to a reduction in the number of molecular parameters to be determined. In order to demonstrate the performance of the 2D-SAFT-VR Mie approach, we present results for the the modelling of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) adsorbed onto dry coal.", "AuthorKeywords": ["2D fluids", "adsorption", "SAFT-VR-Mie"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adsorption model", "Analytical results", "Molecular fluid", "Molecular parameters", "Saft-vr", "Second order perturbation", "Statistical associating fluid theory", "Two Dimensional (2 D)"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073960727", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57204702357": {"Name": "Campos-Villalobos G.", "AuthorID": "57204702357", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Analytical Science, University of Manchester"}, "57212088285": {"Name": "Ravipati S.", "AuthorID": "57212088285", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "6602110644": {"Name": "Haslam A.J.", "AuthorID": "6602110644", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "56839653000": {"Name": "Jackson G.", "AuthorID": "56839653000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "57211448538": {"Name": "Suaste J.", "AuthorID": "57211448538", "AffiliationID": "60033291", "AffiliationName": "Divisi\u00f3n de Ciencias e Ingenier\u00edas, Campus Le\u00f3n, Universidad de Guanajuato"}, "6701666212": {"Name": "Gil-Villegas A.", "AuthorID": "6701666212", "AffiliationID": "60033291", "AffiliationName": "Divisi\u00f3n de Ciencias e Ingenier\u00edas, Campus Le\u00f3n, Universidad de Guanajuato"}}}
