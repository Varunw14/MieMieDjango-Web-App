New instrument-based techniques for measuring AC flare can offer automation and objectivity. This review aims to identify objective instrument-based measures for AC flare. Methods: In this systematic review, we identified studies reporting correlation between instrument-based tests versus clinician AC flare grading, and/or aqueous protein concentration, as well as test reliability. Results: Four index tests were identified in 11 studies: laser-flare photometry (LFP), optical coherence tomography, ocular flare analysis meter (OFAM) and the double-pass technique. The correlation between LFP and clinician grading was 0.40\u20130.93 and 0.87\u20130.94 for LFP and protein concentration. The double-pass technique showed no correlation with clinician grading and insufficient information was available for OFAM. Conclusion: LFP shows moderate to strong correlation with clinician grading and aqueous protein concentration. LFP could be a superior reference test compared to clinician AC flare grading for validating new index tests.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anterior chamber flare", "aqueous humor, aqueous humour", "aqueous protein concentration", "diagnostic test", "laser flare photometry", "optical coherence tomography", "Systematic review", "Tyndall effect", "uveitis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083574171", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"57200397709": {"Name": "Liu X.", "AuthorID": "57200397709", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Ophthalmology, Institute of Inflammation & Ageing, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "54880010400": {"Name": "Denniston A.K.", "AuthorID": "54880010400", "AffiliationID": "121377269", "AffiliationName": "Health Data Research UK"}, "57194946993": {"Name": "McNally T.W.", "AuthorID": "57194946993", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Ophthalmology, Institute of Inflammation & Ageing, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "57216462478": {"Name": "Husain S.", "AuthorID": "57216462478", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Ophthalmology, Institute of Inflammation & Ageing, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "57204641721": {"Name": "Beese S.", "AuthorID": "57204641721", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Health Research, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "57207809707": {"Name": "Moore D.J.", "AuthorID": "57207809707", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Health Research, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "57196316525": {"Name": "Downie L.E.", "AuthorID": "57196316525", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Optometry and Vision Sciences, The University of Melbourne"}, "17342850000": {"Name": "Solebo A.L.", "AuthorID": "17342850000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "56600218500": {"Name": "Faes L.", "AuthorID": "56600218500", "AffiliationID": "60033223", "AffiliationName": "Eye Clinic, Cantonal Hospital of Lucerne"}, "24480921100": {"Name": "Keane P.A.", "AuthorID": "24480921100", "AffiliationID": "121377269", "AffiliationName": "Health Data Research UK"}}}
