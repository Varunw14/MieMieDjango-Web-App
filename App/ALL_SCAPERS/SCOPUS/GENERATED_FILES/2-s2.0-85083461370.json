In typical human development, the left occipital cortex receives retinal input predominantly from the right visual field, and vice-versa. In albinism, there is a more complete decussation of optic nerve fibers at the chiasm, resulting in partial representation of the temporal hemiretina (ipsilateral visual field) in the contralateral hemisphere. In this study, we characterize the receptive field properties for these abnormal representations by conducting detailed fMRI population receptive field mapping in a rare subset of participants with albinism and no ocular nystagmus. We find a nasal bias for receptive field positions in the abnormal temporal hemiretina representation. In addition, by modelling responses to bilateral visual field stimulation in the overlap zone, we found evidence in favor of discrete unilateral receptive fields, suggesting a conservative pattern of spatial selectivity in the presence of abnormal retinal input.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Albinism", "Functional MRI", "Plasticity", "pRF", "Visual cortex"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083461370", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"56190051500": {"Name": "Alvarez I.", "AuthorID": "56190051500", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California, Berkeley"}, "55553818000": {"Name": "Handley S.E.", "AuthorID": "55553818000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "56119414900": {"Name": "Liasis A.", "AuthorID": "56119414900", "AffiliationID": "60012018", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, UPMC Children's Hospital"}, "55290679000": {"Name": "Clark C.A.", "AuthorID": "55290679000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "56857511900": {"Name": "Smittenaar R.", "AuthorID": "56857511900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "7005050489": {"Name": "Sereno M.I.", "AuthorID": "7005050489", "AffiliationID": "60018926", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, San Diego State University"}, "15766309800": {"Name": "Schwarzkopf D.S.", "AuthorID": "15766309800", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "School of Optometry & Vision Science, University of Auckland"}}}
