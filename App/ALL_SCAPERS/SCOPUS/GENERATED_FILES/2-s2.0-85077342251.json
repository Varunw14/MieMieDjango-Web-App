In the case of CMT1A, the commonest subtype of CMT, there have been more than five randomised, double blind placebo-controlled trials. Although these trials were negative for the primary outcome measure, considerable lessons have been learnt leading to the collection of large prospective natural history data sets with which to inform future trial design as well as the development of new and sensitive outcome measures. In this review we summarise the difficulties of conducting clinical trials in a slowly progressive disease such as CMT1A and the requirement for sensitive, reproducible and clinically relevant outcome measures. We summarise the current array of CMT specific outcome measures subdivided into clinical outcome measures, functional outcome measures, patient reported outcome measures, biomarkers of disease burden and treatment specific biomarkers of target engagement. Although there is now an array of CMT specific outcome measures, which collectively incorporate clinically relevant, sensitive and reproducible outputs, a single outcome measure incorporating all three qualities remains elusive.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease", "Clinical trial", "Outcome measures"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077342251", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"]], "AuthorData": {"57218107544": {"Name": "Rossor A.M.", "AuthorID": "57218107544", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuromuscular Diseases, University College London, Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "57203175311": {"Name": "Reilly M.M.", "AuthorID": "57203175311", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuromuscular Diseases, University College London, Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "7005664390": {"Name": "Shy M.E.", "AuthorID": "7005664390", "AffiliationID": "60024324", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Iowa"}}}
