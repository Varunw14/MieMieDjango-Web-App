Indoor and outdoor thermal environmental parameters were measured to evaluate the thermal conditions of bedrooms. Thermal sensation/tendency/acceptance, heating, and health condition were investigated to complete the analysis of attitudes of local residents on the thermal environment of bedrooms, heating and health issues, as well as the analysis of buildings. The observed results demonstrate that occupants in this region have a strong tolerance to low-temperature environments with the 80% acceptable lower temperature of 4.7 \u00b0C and a neutral temperature of 10.7 \u00b0C, with an average clothing insulation over 2.2 clo. Oversized volume and acreage of buildings and windows induce a lower temperature in the bedroom. Infants have a significant effect on heating requirements, including heating duration and temperature setpoint. Local residents are highly concerned about the costs, safety, and health related to heating and thermal environments. All evidence obtained through this investigation shows that it is beneficial to formulate regulations for the shape, envelope, and centralized heating policy for rural residential buildings in the HSCW region.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Age boundary", "Centralized heating", "Health", "Onsite investigation", "Rural area"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071985579", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"57203019087": {"Name": "Liu D.", "AuthorID": "57203019087", "AffiliationID": "60022414", "AffiliationName": "School of civil engineering and architecture, Wuhan University of Technology"}, "55472978600": {"Name": "Ren Z.", "AuthorID": "55472978600", "AffiliationID": "60022414", "AffiliationName": "School of civil engineering and architecture, Wuhan University of Technology"}, "57209421937": {"Name": "Song Z.", "AuthorID": "57209421937", "AffiliationID": "60022414", "AffiliationName": "School of civil engineering and architecture, Wuhan University of Technology"}, "57193546559": {"Name": "Chen X.", "AuthorID": "57193546559", "AffiliationID": "60022414", "AffiliationName": "School of civil engineering and architecture, Wuhan University of Technology"}, "57220851966": {"Name": "Wei S.", "AuthorID": "57220851966", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London"}, "56274566400": {"Name": "Li P.", "AuthorID": "56274566400", "AffiliationID": "60032882", "AffiliationName": "Department of the Built Environment, Eindhoven University of Technology"}}}
