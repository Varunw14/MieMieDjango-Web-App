Brain Pathology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of International Society of NeuropathologyTriggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 TREM2 was identified as a risk factor for late onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). Here we compared TREM2 cases with a variant (TREM2+) and cases without a TREM2 variant (TREM2\u2212), considering pathological burden, inflammatory response and altered canonical pathways and biochemical functions between the cohorts. We hypothesised that TREM2+ cases would have a loss of function, indicating an altered inflammatory profile compared to TREM2\u2212 cases. Immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies against A\u03b2, tau and microglia markers in TREM2+ cases, with and without AD, which were compared to sporadic TREM2\u2212 AD, familial AD and neurologically normal control cases. A\u03b2 and tau load were measured along with the composition of A\u03b2 plaques, in addition to microglial load and circularity. Expression and proteomic profiles were determined from the frontal cortex of selected cases. TREM2+ control cases had no A\u03b2 or tau deposition. No differences in the amount of A\u03b2 or tau, or the composition of A\u03b2 plaques were observed between TREM2+ and TREM2\u2212 SAD cases. There were no differences in microglial load observed between disease groups. However, the TREM2+ SAD cases showed more amoeboid microglia than the TREM2\u2212 SAD cases, although no differences in the spatial relationship of microglia and A\u03b2 plaques were identified. Visualisation of the canonical pathways and biological functions showed differences between the disease groups and the normal controls, clearly showing a number of pathways upregulated in TREM2+ SAD, TREM2\u2212 SAD and FAD groups whilst, the TREM2+ controls cases showed a downregulation of the majority of the represented pathways. These findings suggest that the TREM2+ control group, although carrying the TREM2+ variant, have no pathological hallmarks of AD, have altered microglial and expression profiles compared to the TREM2+ SAD cases. This indicates that other unknown factors may initiate the onset of AD, with TREM2 influencing the microglial involvement in disease pathogenesis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "amyloid", "APOE", "microglia", "multiomics", "neuroinflammation", "tau", "TREM2"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083970344", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57207195643": {"Name": "Toomey C.E.", "AuthorID": "57207195643", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative diseases, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "57199720509": {"Name": "Benson B.C.", "AuthorID": "57199720509", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "The Queen Square Brain Bank for Neurological Disorders, Department of Clinical and Movement Neuroscience, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "57216583456": {"Name": "Packham G.", "AuthorID": "57216583456", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "The Queen Square Brain Bank for Neurological Disorders, Department of Clinical and Movement Neuroscience, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "6602721075": {"Name": "Lashley T.", "AuthorID": "6602721075", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative diseases, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "56458521200": {"Name": "Heywood W.", "AuthorID": "56458521200", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Translational Omics, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, UCL"}, "7202875406": {"Name": "Mills K.", "AuthorID": "7202875406", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Translational Omics, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, UCL"}}}
