Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of SSIEMInherited cutis laxa, or inelastic, sagging skin is a genetic condition of premature and generalised connective tissue ageing, affecting various elastic components of the extracellular matrix. Several cutis laxa syndromes are inborn errors of metabolism and lead to severe neurological symptoms. In a patient with cutis laxa, a choreoathetoid movement disorder, dysmorphic features and intellectual disability we performed exome sequencing to elucidate the underlying genetic defect. We identified the amino acid substitution R275W in phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type II\u03b1, caused by a homozygous missense mutation in the PI4K2A gene. We used lipidomics, complexome profiling and functional studies to measure phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate synthesis in the patient and evaluated PI4K2A deficient mice to define a novel metabolic disorder. The R275W residue, located on the surface of the protein, is involved in forming electrostatic interactions with the membrane. The catalytic activity of PI4K2A in patient fibroblasts was severely reduced and lipid mass spectrometry showed that particular acyl-chain pools of PI4P and PI(4,5)P2 were decreased. Phosphoinositide lipids play a major role in intracellular signalling and trafficking and regulate the balance between proliferation and apoptosis. Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases such as PI4K2A mediate the first step in the main metabolic pathway that generates PI4P, PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3. Although neurologic involvement is common, cutis laxa has not been reported previously in metabolic defects affecting signalling. Here we describe a patient with a complex neurological phenotype, premature ageing and a mutation in PI4K2A, illustrating the importance of this enzyme in the generation of inositol lipids with particular acylation characteristics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["choreoathetosis", "cutis laxa", "inborn error of metabolism", "movement disorder", "neurocutaneous disorder", "neurometabolism", "phosphatidyl inositol", "PI4K2A"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087182789", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"37033137800": {"Name": "Mohamed M.", "AuthorID": "37033137800", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "57211362228": {"Name": "Gardeitchik T.", "AuthorID": "57211362228", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "57192877898": {"Name": "Dalloyaux D.", "AuthorID": "57192877898", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "57217388299": {"Name": "Spelbrink H.", "AuthorID": "57217388299", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "12765212800": {"Name": "Hoischen A.", "AuthorID": "12765212800", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "36010475500": {"Name": "Balasubramaniam S.", "AuthorID": "36010475500", "AffiliationID": "60026571", "AffiliationName": "Western Sydney Genetics Program, The Children's Hospital at Westmead"}, "26023535100": {"Name": "Ngu L.H.", "AuthorID": "26023535100", "AffiliationID": "60025530", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Genetic Department, Hospital Kuala Lumpur, Jalan Pahang"}, "23568050700": {"Name": "Guerrero-Castillo S.", "AuthorID": "23568050700", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Translational Metabolic Laboratory, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "7004268249": {"Name": "Brandt U.", "AuthorID": "7004268249", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Translational Metabolic Laboratory, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "57192877865": {"Name": "van Kraaij S.", "AuthorID": "57192877865", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Translational Metabolic Laboratory, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "7103290550": {"Name": "Wevers R.A.", "AuthorID": "7103290550", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Translational Metabolic Laboratory, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "15758720700": {"Name": "Venselaar H.", "AuthorID": "15758720700", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Center of Molecular and Biomolecular Informatics, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "6701852562": {"Name": "Urban Z.", "AuthorID": "6701852562", "AffiliationID": "60015543", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Genetics, Graduate School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh"}, "6602411357": {"Name": "Al-Shawi R.", "AuthorID": "6602411357", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Drug Discovery Unit, Division of Medicine, Royal Free Campus, University College London"}, "57210462155": {"Name": "Simons J.P.", "AuthorID": "57210462155", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Drug Discovery Unit, Division of Medicine, Royal Free Campus, University College London"}, "57220759093": {"Name": "Frison M.", "AuthorID": "57220759093", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Drug Discovery Unit, Division of Medicine, Royal Free Campus, University College London"}, "23396219200": {"Name": "Callewaert B.", "AuthorID": "23396219200", "AffiliationID": "60068590", "AffiliationName": "Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University Hospital"}, "35071449000": {"Name": "Kallemeijn W.W.", "AuthorID": "35071449000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "7102738034": {"Name": "Aerts J.M.F.G.", "AuthorID": "7102738034", "AffiliationID": "60070180, 60019816", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biochemistry, Leiden Institute of Chemistry, Leiden University"}, "35563939800": {"Name": "Waugh M.G.", "AuthorID": "35563939800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lipid and Membrane Biology Group, Institute for Liver & Digestive Health, University College London"}, "7004963647": {"Name": "Morava E.", "AuthorID": "7004963647", "AffiliationID": "100808706", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, University Medical Centre"}}}
