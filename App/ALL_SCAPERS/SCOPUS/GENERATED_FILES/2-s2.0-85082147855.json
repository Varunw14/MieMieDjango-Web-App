Our aim is to assess the impact of strut embedment/protrusion of bioresorbable scaffold on local shear stress distribution in different atherosclerotic plaque types. Methods and results: Fifteen Absorb everolimus-eluting Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffolds were implanted in human epicardial coronary arteries. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed post-scaffold implantation and strut embedment/protrusion were analysed using a dedicated software. OCT data were fused with angiography to reconstruct 3D coronary anatomy. Blood flow simulation was performed and wall shear stress (WSS) was estimated in each scaffolded surface and the relationship between strut embedment/protrusion and WSS was evaluated. There were 9083 struts analysed. Ninety-seven percent of the struts (n = 8840) were well-apposed and 243 (3%) were malapposed. At cross-section level (n = 1289), strut embedment was significantly increased in fibroatheromatous plaques (76 \u00b1 48 \u03bcm) and decreased in fibrocalcific plaques (35 \u00b1 52 \u03bcm). Compatible with strut embedment, WSS was significantly higher in lipid-rich fibroatheromatous plaques (1.50 \u00b1 0.81 Pa), whereas significantly decreased in fibrocalcified plaques (1.05 \u00b1 0.91 Pa). After categorization of WSS as low (<1.0 Pa) and normal/high WSS (\u22651.0 Pa), the percent of low WSS in the plaque subgroups were 30.1%, 31.1%, 25.4%, and 36.2% for non-diseased vessel wall, fibrous plaque, fibroatheromatous plaque, and fibrocalcific plaque, respectively (P-overall < 0.001). Conclusion: The composition of the underlying plaque influences strut embedment which seems to have effect on WSS. The struts deeply embedded in lipid-rich fibroatheromas plaques resulted in higher WSS compared with the other plaque types.", "AuthorKeywords": ["atherosclerotic plaque", "bioresorbable scaffold", "shear stress", "strut embedment", "strut protrusion"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082147855", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"7005835193": {"Name": "Torii R.", "AuthorID": "7005835193", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "23669358200": {"Name": "Tenekecioglu E.", "AuthorID": "23669358200", "AffiliationID": "60032114, 60002794", "AffiliationName": "Department of Interventional Cardiology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Thoraxcenter"}, "6701483911": {"Name": "Van Geuns R.", "AuthorID": "6701483911", "AffiliationID": "60032114, 60002794", "AffiliationName": "Department of Interventional Cardiology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Thoraxcenter"}, "15051093400": {"Name": "Onuma Y.", "AuthorID": "15051093400", "AffiliationID": "60032114, 60002794", "AffiliationName": "Department of Interventional Cardiology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Thoraxcenter"}, "34573036500": {"Name": "Serruys P.W.", "AuthorID": "34573036500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College"}, "57193226922": {"Name": "Katagiri Y.", "AuthorID": "57193226922", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam"}, "56541729100": {"Name": "Chichareon P.", "AuthorID": "56541729100", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam"}, "57115149800": {"Name": "Sotomi Y.", "AuthorID": "57115149800", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam"}, "7402943754": {"Name": "Asano T.", "AuthorID": "7402943754", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam"}, "55932949800": {"Name": "Modolo R.", "AuthorID": "55932949800", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam"}, "57204287561": {"Name": "Takahashi K.", "AuthorID": "57204287561", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam"}, "7101611206": {"Name": "Dijkstra J.", "AuthorID": "7101611206", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "LKEB-Division of Image Processing, Department of Radiology, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "56603903800": {"Name": "Jonker H.", "AuthorID": "56603903800", "AffiliationID": "60070156", "AffiliationName": "Cardialysis"}, "6602639256": {"Name": "Pekkan K.", "AuthorID": "6602639256", "AffiliationID": "60006369", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Koc University"}, "15822122100": {"Name": "Bourantas C.V.", "AuthorID": "15822122100", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Barts Heart Centre"}}}
