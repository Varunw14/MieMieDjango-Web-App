Characterisation of the communication among brain areas mediating such processes may shed light on mechanisms and noninvasively indicate risk. We used rs-fMRI to examine network properties among brain structures in people with epilepsy who suffered SUDEP (n = 8) over an 8-year follow-up period, compared with matched high- and low-risk subjects (n = 16/group) who did not suffer SUDEP during that period, and a group of healthy controls (n = 16). Network analysis was employed to explore connectivity within a \u2018regulatory-subnetwork\u2019 of brain regions involved in autonomic and respiratory regulation, and over the whole-brain. Modularity, the extent of network organization into separate modules, was significantly reduced in the regulatory-subnetwork, and the whole-brain, in SUDEP and high-risk. Increased participation, a local measure of inter-modular belonging, was evident in SUDEP and high-risk groups, particularly among thalamic structures. The medial prefrontal thalamus was increased in SUDEP compared with all other control groups, including high-risk. Patterns of hub topology were similar in SUDEP and high-risk, but were more extensive in low-risk patients, who displayed greater hub prevalence and a radical reorganization of hubs in the subnetwork. SUDEP is associated with reduced functional organization among cortical and sub-cortical brain regions mediating autonomic and respiratory regulation. Living high-risk subjects demonstrated similar patterns, suggesting such network measures may provide prospective risk-indicating value, though a crucial difference between SUDEP and high-risk was altered connectivity of the medial thalamus in SUDEP, which was also elevated compared with all sub-groups. Disturbed thalamic connectivity may reflect a potential non-invasive marker of elevated SUDEP risk.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amygdala", "Graph theory", "Rs-fmri", "SUDEP", "Thalamus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Brain", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Nerve Net", "Prospective Studies", "Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074617156", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"57211608706": {"Name": "LA A.", "AuthorID": "57211608706", "AffiliationID": "60013780", "AffiliationName": "The Center for SUDEP Research, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"}, "57211598580": {"Name": "CA S.", "AuthorID": "57211598580", "AffiliationID": "60013780", "AffiliationName": "The Center for SUDEP Research, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"}, "57211606555": {"Name": "L L.", "AuthorID": "57211606555", "AffiliationID": "60030943", "AffiliationName": "Epilepsy Society MRI Unit, Chalfont St Peter"}, "57190767305": {"Name": "B D.", "AuthorID": "57190767305", "AffiliationID": "60013780", "AffiliationName": "The Center for SUDEP Research, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"}, "57211608408": {"Name": "RM H.", "AuthorID": "57211608408", "AffiliationID": "60005247, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA"}, "57211607817": {"Name": "R K.", "AuthorID": "57211607817", "AffiliationID": "60005247, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA"}, "57211606952": {"Name": "JA O.", "AuthorID": "57211606952", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "UCLA Brain Research Institute"}, "57211604464": {"Name": "SB V.", "AuthorID": "57211604464", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, Centre for Medical Image Computing, UCL"}, "57211606031": {"Name": "M G.", "AuthorID": "57211606031", "AffiliationID": "60107050, 60008134, 60102127", "AffiliationName": "Aix Marseille University, CNRS"}, "57211607838": {"Name": "S O.", "AuthorID": "57211607838", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, St Thomas\u2019 Hospital, King's College London"}, "57211602264": {"Name": "SD L.", "AuthorID": "57211602264", "AffiliationID": "60027512", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Texas Health Sciences Center at Houston"}}}
