However, the techniques that are currently used to assess gut function are either highly invasive or unreliable. Here we present an alternative, non-invasive sensing modality for assessment of gut function based on fluorescence spectroscopy. In this approach, patients receive an oral dose of a fluorescent contrast agent and a fibre-optic probe is used to make fluorescence measurements through the skin. This provides a readout of the degree to which fluorescent dyes have permeated from the gut into the blood stream. We present preliminary results from our first measurements in human volunteers demonstrating the potential of the technique for non-invasive monitoring of multiple aspects of gastro-intestinal health.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Contrast Media", "Fluorescent Dyes", "Gastrointestinal Tract", "Humans", "Inflammatory Bowel Diseases", "Spectrometry, Fluorescence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091716574", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57191850567": {"Name": "Maurice J.", "AuthorID": "57191850567", "AffiliationID": "60022871, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery & Cancer, St. Mary\u2019s Hospital Campus, Imperial College London"}, "57219216085": {"Name": "Tadbier A.W.", "AuthorID": "57219216085", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "The Hamlyn Centre, Institute of Global Health Innovation, South Kensington, Imperial College London"}, "7005622558": {"Name": "Hoare J.", "AuthorID": "7005622558", "AffiliationID": "60022871, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery & Cancer, St. Mary\u2019s Hospital Campus, Imperial College London"}, "14633357600": {"Name": "Darzi A.", "AuthorID": "14633357600", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "The Hamlyn Centre, Institute of Global Health Innovation, South Kensington, Imperial College London"}, "55727149100": {"Name": "Thompson A.J.", "AuthorID": "55727149100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "The Hamlyn Centre, Institute of Global Health Innovation, South Kensington, Imperial College London"}, "56585975100": {"Name": "Lett A.M.", "AuthorID": "56585975100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction, Imperial College London"}, "57219216044": {"Name": "Skinner C.", "AuthorID": "57219216044", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction, Imperial College London"}, "57219216741": {"Name": "Lim A.", "AuthorID": "57219216741", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction, Imperial College London"}, "24400357500": {"Name": "Vergis N.", "AuthorID": "24400357500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction, Imperial College London"}, "35242224200": {"Name": "Goldin R.", "AuthorID": "35242224200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction, Imperial College London"}, "57208158618": {"Name": "Thursz M.", "AuthorID": "57208158618", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction, Imperial College London"}, "57219216516": {"Name": "Richardson M.", "AuthorID": "57219216516", "AffiliationID": "60016550, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Ophthalmology Research Group, Western Eye Hospital, Imperial College London"}, "57194778924": {"Name": "Miodragovic S.", "AuthorID": "57194778924", "AffiliationID": "60016550, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Ophthalmology Research Group, Western Eye Hospital, Imperial College London"}, "57210287162": {"Name": "Cordeiro M.F.", "AuthorID": "57210287162", "AffiliationID": "60016550, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Ophthalmology Research Group, Western Eye Hospital, Imperial College London"}, "57219216299": {"Name": "Thomas A.P.", "AuthorID": "57219216299", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, White City Campus, Imperial College London"}, "57211188938": {"Name": "Summers P.A.", "AuthorID": "57211188938", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, White City Campus, Imperial College London"}, "55554174800": {"Name": "Vilar R.", "AuthorID": "55554174800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, White City Campus, Imperial College London"}, "7801545253": {"Name": "Kuimova M.K.", "AuthorID": "7801545253", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, White City Campus, Imperial College London"}, "56583784000": {"Name": "Vyas K.", "AuthorID": "56583784000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "The Hamlyn Centre, Institute of Global Health Innovation, South Kensington, Imperial College London"}, "57210439233": {"Name": "Kelly P.", "AuthorID": "57210439233", "AffiliationID": "60072797", "AffiliationName": "Tropical Gastroenterology and Nutrition Group, University of Zambia School of Medicine"}}}
