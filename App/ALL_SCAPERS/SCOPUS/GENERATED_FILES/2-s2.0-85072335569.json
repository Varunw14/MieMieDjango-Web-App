Here, we show that liposome encapsulation of such agents can be exploited to enhance the CEST signal by reducing the overall apparent exchange rate. We have developed a concise analytical model to describe the liposomal contrast dependence on several parameters such as pH, temperature, irradiation amplitude, and intraliposomal water content. This is the first study in which a model has been constructed to measure the exchange properties of diamagnetic CEST agents encapsulated inside liposomes. Experimentally measured exchange rates of glucose and 2-DG in the liposomal system were found to be reduced due to the intermembrane exchange between the intra- and extraliposomal compartments because of restrictions in water transfer imposed by the lipid membrane. These new theoretical and experimental findings will benefit applications of diamagnetic liposomes to image biological processes. In addition, combining this analytical model with measurements of the CEST signal enhancement using liposomes as a model membrane system is an important new general technique for studying membrane permeability.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biological process", "Chemical exchange", "Chemical exchange saturation transfer", "High sensitivity", "Membrane permeability", "Model membrane systems", "Signal enhancement", "Water transfers", "Contrast Media", "Deoxyglucose", "Glucose", "Liposomes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072335569", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57194760638": {"Name": "Demetriou E.", "AuthorID": "57194760638", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7004309393": {"Name": "Golay X.", "AuthorID": "7004309393", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57205137509": {"Name": "Story H.E.", "AuthorID": "57205137509", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "51664470800": {"Name": "Bofinger R.", "AuthorID": "51664470800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6603904305": {"Name": "Hailes H.C.", "AuthorID": "6603904305", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7005824166": {"Name": "Tabor A.B.", "AuthorID": "7005824166", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
