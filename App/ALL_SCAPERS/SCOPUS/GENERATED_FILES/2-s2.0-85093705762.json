Overall, tau pathology correlates well with neurodegeneration and cell loss, but the spatial and temporal association between tau pathology and overt volume loss (atrophy) associated with structural changes or cell loss is unclear. Using in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with tensor-based morphometry (TBM), we mapped the spatiotemporal pattern of structural changes in a mouse model of AD-like progressive tauopathy. A novel, coregistered in vivo MRI atlas was then applied to identify regions in the medial temporal lobe that had a significant volume reduction. Our study shows that in a mouse model of tauopathy spread, the propagation of tau pathology from the EC to the hippocampus is associated with TBM-related atrophy, but atrophy in the dentate gyrus and subiculum precedes overt cell loss.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Dentate gyrus", "Entorhinal cortex", "Neurodegeneration", "Spatiotemporal patterns", "Temporal association", "Temporal lobes", "Tensor-based morphometry", "Volume reductions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85093705762", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57193002231": {"Name": "Fung C.W.", "AuthorID": "57193002231", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University"}, "23967665700": {"Name": "Figueroa H.Y.", "AuthorID": "23967665700", "AffiliationID": "60030162, 60002388", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University"}, "35393105600": {"Name": "Duff K.E.", "AuthorID": "35393105600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute, University College London"}, "7005877325": {"Name": "Konofagou E.E.", "AuthorID": "7005877325", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University"}, "57201001445": {"Name": "Guo J.", "AuthorID": "57201001445", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Zuckerman Institute, Columbia University"}, "57189847655": {"Name": "Fu H.", "AuthorID": "57189847655", "AffiliationID": "60003500", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Chronic Brain Injury, Discovery Themes, Ohio State University"}}}
