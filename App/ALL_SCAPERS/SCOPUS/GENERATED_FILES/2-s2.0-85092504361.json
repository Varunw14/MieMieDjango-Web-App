In the first two years of its availability in Zimbabwe, 37.1% of FSW in trial sites initiated PrEP and received at least one re-supply. We conducted a qualitative study on perceptions of PrEP among 19 early users selected from sites with varying rates of PrEP initiation. Narrative interviews examined the pathways taken by FSW from hearing about PrEP, through their decision to start taking it, and early experiences. FSW appreciated PrEP\u2019s introduction within familiar and trusted \u201cfriendly\u201d services tailored for sex workers and valued positive encouragement from clinic staff and peers over negative influence from family members. They also found PrEP difficult to understand at first, and feared side effects and rare adverse complications described in information leaflets. While FSW identified individual strategies for remembering to take their medication, they also relied on structured peer adherence support, leading some FSW to actively promote the method to other FSW as \u201cPrEP champions\u201d. Information on how early users experience a new prevention technology such as PrEP can inform design of interventions that leverage existing support structures and target key barriers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["female sex workers", "PrEP", "qualitative", "Zimbabwe"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092504361", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"14029766400": {"Name": "Busza J.", "AuthorID": "14029766400", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Evaluation, London School of Hygiene Tropical Medicine"}, "57202558738": {"Name": "Phillips A.N.", "AuthorID": "57202558738", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, UCL, Royal Free Hospital"}, "15923391000": {"Name": "Mushati P.", "AuthorID": "15923391000", "AffiliationID": "60138807", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Sexual Health and HIV AIDS Research"}, "57200551734": {"Name": "Chiyaka T.", "AuthorID": "57200551734", "AffiliationID": "60138807", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Sexual Health and HIV AIDS Research"}, "56062888400": {"Name": "Magutshwa S.", "AuthorID": "56062888400", "AffiliationID": "60138807", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Sexual Health and HIV AIDS Research"}, "57204738301": {"Name": "Musemburi S.", "AuthorID": "57204738301", "AffiliationID": "60138807", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Sexual Health and HIV AIDS Research"}, "56432392100": {"Name": "Cowan F.M.", "AuthorID": "56432392100", "AffiliationID": "60020934", "AffiliationName": "Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"}}}
