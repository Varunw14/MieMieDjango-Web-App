But does the mere fact that a service or intervention is unaffordable present a reason not to fund it? Thus far, the philosophical literature has remained largely silent on this issue. However, in this article, we consider this kind of thinking in depth. Albeit with certain important caveats, we argue that the use of affordability criteria in matters of public financing commits what Parfit might have called a \u2018mistake in moral mathematics\u2019. First, it fails to abide by what we term a principle of \u2018non-perfectionism\u2019 in moral action: the mere fact that it is practically impossible for you to do all the good that you have reason to do does not present a reason not to do whatever good you can do. And second, when used as a means of arbitrating between which services to fund, affordability criteria can lead to a kind of \u2018numerical discrimination\u2019. Various attendant issues around fairness and lotteries are also discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Affordability", "Broome", "Fairness", "Lotteries", "Non-perfectionism", "Numerical discrimination", "Total cost"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073939949", "SubjectAreas": [["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"], ["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"]], "AuthorData": {"36667338000": {"Name": "Rumbold B.", "AuthorID": "36667338000", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Department of Philosophy, University of Nottingham"}, "57193583890": {"Name": "Charlton V.", "AuthorID": "57193583890", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health & Social Medicine, King\u2019s College London"}, "25936631000": {"Name": "Rid A.", "AuthorID": "25936631000", "AffiliationID": "60006577", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioethics, The Clinical Center, U.S. National Institutes of Health"}, "57193730546": {"Name": "Mitchell P.", "AuthorID": "57193730546", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Philosophy, University College London"}, "56898288800": {"Name": "Wilson J.", "AuthorID": "56898288800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Philosophy, University College London"}, "57200609609": {"Name": "Littlejohns P.", "AuthorID": "57200609609", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Population Health and Environmental Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "57150668700": {"Name": "Max C.", "AuthorID": "57150668700", "AffiliationID": "123553960", "AffiliationName": "Independent"}, "7006337711": {"Name": "Weale A.", "AuthorID": "7006337711", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Political Science, University College London"}}}
