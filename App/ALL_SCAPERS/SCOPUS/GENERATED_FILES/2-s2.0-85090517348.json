Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) at the ZnO/ZnMgO interface are promising for applications in spintronics and quantum computing due to the combination of low spin-orbit coupling and high electron mobility. Growing high mobility 2DEGs requires high quality substrates with low impurity densities. In this work we demonstrate a ZnO substrate sample treatment combining high temperature rapid thermal annealing and chemical etching to improve the surface quality for the subsequent growth of 2DEGs. This process enables the growth of a 2DEG with low-temperature mobility of 4.8 \u00d7 104 cm2V\u22121s\u22121. An unannealed control sample shows a scattering rate at least three times greater than the annealed sample.", "AuthorKeywords": ["2DEG", "Heterostructure", "Molecular beam epitaxy", "Semiconductor II-VI material", "ZnO"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090517348", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"57218872848": {"Name": "Sparks M.J.", "AuthorID": "57218872848", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "57192929269": {"Name": "Kennedy O.W.", "AuthorID": "57192929269", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "7005264376": {"Name": "Warburton P.A.", "AuthorID": "7005264376", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
