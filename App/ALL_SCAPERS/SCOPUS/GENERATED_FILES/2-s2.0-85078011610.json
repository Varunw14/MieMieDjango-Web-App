Medical Physics published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of American Association of Physicists in Medicine.Positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) potentially offers several advantages over positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), for example, no CT radiation dose and soft tissue images from MR acquired at the same time as the PET. However, obtaining accurate linear attenuation correction (LAC) factors for the lung remains difficult in PET/MRI. LACs depend on electron density and in the lung, these vary significantly both within an individual and from person to person. Current commercial practice is to use a single-valued population-based lung LAC, and better estimation is needed to improve quantification. Given the under-appreciation of lung attenuation estimation as an issue, the inaccuracy of PET quantification due to the use of single-valued lung LACs, the unique challenges of lung estimation, and the emerging status of PET/MRI scanners in lung disease, a review is timely. This paper highlights past and present methods, categorizing them into segmentation, atlas/mapping, and emission-based schemes. Potential strategies for future developments are also presented.", "AuthorKeywords": ["attenuation estimation", "lung", "magnetic resonance imaging", "medical imaging", "positron emission tomography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Attenuation estimation", "Linear attenuation", "lung", "On-electron density", "Past and present", "Positron emission tomography/computed tomographies", "Positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI)", "Potential techniques", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Lung", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Respiration"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078011610", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57213825340": {"Name": "Lillington J.", "AuthorID": "57213825340", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "57210526592": {"Name": "Atkinson D.", "AuthorID": "57210526592", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "6505781416": {"Name": "Brusaferri L.", "AuthorID": "6505781416", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "57203050071": {"Name": "Hutton B.F.", "AuthorID": "57203050071", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "36905492400": {"Name": "Fraioli F.", "AuthorID": "36905492400", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "23480655200": {"Name": "Thielemans K.", "AuthorID": "23480655200", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "57203990337": {"Name": "Kl\u00e4ser K.", "AuthorID": "57203990337", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "7005759823": {"Name": "Arridge S.", "AuthorID": "7005759823", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "56628808200": {"Name": "Shmueli K.", "AuthorID": "56628808200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging Group, Department of Medical Physics & Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57194071727": {"Name": "Neji R.", "AuthorID": "57194071727", "AffiliationID": "119704954", "AffiliationName": "MR Research Collaborations, Siemens Healthcare Limited"}, "57204636980": {"Name": "Cardoso M.J.", "AuthorID": "57204636980", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}}}
