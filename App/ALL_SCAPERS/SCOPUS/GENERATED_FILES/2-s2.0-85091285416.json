Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdObjective: To compare a behavioural management program (test) to a standard communication approach (control) to reduce plaque, improve clinical outcomes and patient's compliance with oral self-care. Background: Since psychological factors affect oral health\u2013related behaviours, approaches directed at changing behaviours and improving compliance might improve the effect of oral health education. Materials and Methods: This was a randomized, single-blind, parallel-design trial involving 71 patients with mild to moderate periodontitis. During a run-in period, all participants began using a power toothbrush. Two sessions of non-surgical periodontal therapy were performed post-baseline, along with one of the two oral healthcare communication approaches. Plaque and bleeding scores, probing pocket depth (PPD) and clinical attachment level (CAL) were recorded at the screening visit, baseline visit and at 8 and 14 weeks post-baseline. Patients were asked to fill in oral self-care diaries. Experience questionnaires were administered to both clinicians and patients to assess subjective experience of the clinician-patient interactions during the visits. Results: In both groups, a significant reduction in plaque and bleeding scores was observed from baseline to 8 weeks after baseline, which then remained stable at week 14, but no differences between the groups were noted. An improvement in CAL and PPD was recorded at week 8 post-baseline in the test compared to the control group. No inter-group differences in the clinician's and subject's experience questionnaires were observed. Conclusion: Both approaches significantly promoted periodontal health. However, changing lifestyle requires repeated communication/engagement over time and a behavioural management program based upon two visits did not provide additional benefit compared to a standard approach.", "AuthorKeywords": ["behavioural management", "dental hygiene", "oral health", "periodontitis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091285416", "SubjectAreas": [["Periodontics", "DENT", "3506"]], "AuthorData": {"7004314492": {"Name": "Donos N.", "AuthorID": "7004314492", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Oral Immunobiology & Regenerative Medicine and Centre for Oral Clinical Research, Institute of Dentistry, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "56395450800": {"Name": "Calciolari E.", "AuthorID": "56395450800", "AffiliationID": "60004969", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Surgery, School of Dental Medicine, University of Parma"}, "22835642700": {"Name": "Nibali L.", "AuthorID": "22835642700", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60009797", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Host-Microbiome Interactions, Guy's Hospital, Kings College London"}, "19637686000": {"Name": "Suvan J.E.", "AuthorID": "19637686000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013985", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Periodontology, Eastman Dental Institute, University College London (UCL)"}, "7003337474": {"Name": "Rollnick S.", "AuthorID": "7003337474", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cochrane School of Primary Care & Public Health, Cardiff University"}}}
