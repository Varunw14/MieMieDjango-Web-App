Alzheimer's & Dementia published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of Alzheimer's AssociationIntroduction: Conventional risk factors targeted by prevention (e.g., low education, smoking, and obesity) are associated with a 1.2- to 2-fold increased risk of dementia. It is unclear whether having a physical disease is an equally important risk factor for dementia. Methods: In this exploratory multicohort study of 283,414 community-dwelling participants, we examined 22 common hospital-treated physical diseases as risk factors for dementia. Results: During a median follow-up of 19 years, a total of 3416 participants developed dementia. Those who had erysipelas (hazard ratio = 1.82; 95% confidence interval = 1.53 to 2.17), hypothyroidism (1.94; 1.59 to 2.38), myocardial infarction (1.41; 1.20 to 1.64), ischemic heart disease (1.32; 1.18 to 1.49), cerebral infarction (2.44; 2.14 to 2.77), duodenal ulcers (1.88; 1.42 to 2.49), gastritis and duodenitis (1.82; 1.46 to 2.27), or osteoporosis (2.38; 1.75 to 3.23) were at a significantly increased risk of dementia. These associations were not explained by conventional risk factors or reverse causation. Discussion: In addition to conventional risk factors, several physical diseases may increase the long-term risk of dementia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cohort studies", "dementia", "disease", "hospitalization", "risk factors"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090152699", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"53881929900": {"Name": "Sipil\u00e4 P.N.", "AuthorID": "53881929900", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Helsinki Institute of Life Science, University of Helsinki"}, "57190136283": {"Name": "Lindbohm J.V.", "AuthorID": "57190136283", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "16835278700": {"Name": "Nyberg S.T.", "AuthorID": "16835278700", "AffiliationID": "60010493", "AffiliationName": "Finnish Institute of Occupational Health"}, "7003843149": {"Name": "Pentti J.", "AuthorID": "7003843149", "AffiliationID": "60010493", "AffiliationName": "Finnish Institute of Occupational Health"}, "57218590862": {"Name": "Kivim\u00e4ki M.", "AuthorID": "57218590862", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "9734197200": {"Name": "Singh-Manoux A.", "AuthorID": "9734197200", "AffiliationID": "60112042, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM U1153, Epidemiology of Ageing and Neurodegenerative Diseases, Universit\u00e9 de Paris"}, "7103265845": {"Name": "Shipley M.J.", "AuthorID": "7103265845", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "57209971397": {"Name": "Kiiskinen T.", "AuthorID": "57209971397", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki"}, "13403065100": {"Name": "Havulinna A.S.", "AuthorID": "13403065100", "AffiliationID": "60104546", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health and Welfare"}, "7003922524": {"Name": "Vahtera J.", "AuthorID": "7003922524", "AffiliationID": "60025765", "AffiliationName": "Turku University Hospital"}}}
