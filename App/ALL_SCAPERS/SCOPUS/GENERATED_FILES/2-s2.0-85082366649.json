In this study, a triple-junction cell was fabricated from InGaP/GaAs and crystalline Si subcells using the smart stack method, which resulted in a conversion efficiency of 23.2%. The EQE analysis of the smart stack cell was also carried out, suggesting that higher efficiencies are feasible through better current matching among the subcells.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Crystalline Si", "Current matching", "EQE analysis", "Higher efficiency", "InGaP/GaAs", "Multi-junctions", "PD nano particle", "Triple junction cells"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082366649", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"]], "AuthorData": {"55203096200": {"Name": "Mizuno H.", "AuthorID": "55203096200", "AffiliationID": "60024621", "AffiliationName": "Renewable Energy Research Center, Fukushima Renewable Energy Institute, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology"}, "8532532600": {"Name": "Mochizuki T.", "AuthorID": "8532532600", "AffiliationID": "60024621", "AffiliationName": "Renewable Energy Research Center, Fukushima Renewable Energy Institute, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology"}, "7003420512": {"Name": "Takato H.", "AuthorID": "7003420512", "AffiliationID": "60024621", "AffiliationName": "Renewable Energy Research Center, Fukushima Renewable Energy Institute, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology"}, "55481923200": {"Name": "Makita K.", "AuthorID": "55481923200", "AffiliationID": "60024621", "AffiliationName": "Research Center for Photovoltaics, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology"}, "6602531343": {"Name": "Tayagaki T.", "AuthorID": "6602531343", "AffiliationID": "60024621", "AffiliationName": "Research Center for Photovoltaics, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology"}, "7101995127": {"Name": "Sugaya T.", "AuthorID": "7101995127", "AffiliationID": "60024621", "AffiliationName": "Research Center for Photovoltaics, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology"}, "6602330441": {"Name": "Mehrvarz H.", "AuthorID": "6602330441", "AffiliationID": "60028333, 60190746", "AffiliationName": "Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics (ACAP), School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering, University of New South Wales"}, "57202528457": {"Name": "Green M.", "AuthorID": "57202528457", "AffiliationID": "60028333, 60190746", "AffiliationName": "Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics (ACAP), School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering, University of New South Wales"}, "24464346900": {"Name": "Ho-Baillie A.", "AuthorID": "24464346900", "AffiliationID": "60028333, 60190746", "AffiliationName": "Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics (ACAP), School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering, University of New South Wales"}}}
