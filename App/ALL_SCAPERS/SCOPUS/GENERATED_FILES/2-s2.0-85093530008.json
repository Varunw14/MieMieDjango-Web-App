However, due to the lack of scientific guidelines, its natural ventilation performance is lower than expected. Natural ventilation potential strongly depends on the roof geometry and opening mode, which have not yet been investigated for LSCCSD. This paper presents a detailed evaluation of the impact of dome geometry (rise span ratio), opening height, and opening modes on the ventilation performance of LSCCSD. The evaluation is based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods and is validated by available wind tunnel testing. We employed three evaluation indicators, which are wind pressure coefficient, effective ventilation rate, and wind speed ratio. The results demonstrate that the rise span ratio has a significant effect on the wind pressure difference and the effective ventilation rate increases by approximately 9%\u201342% with a single-annular opening. When double-annular openings are set in a strong positive pressure zone, the effective ventilation rate increases by 100% and the average wind speed ratio increases by 50%. When it is compared with single one with similar opening height, the effective ventilation rate increases by 25%. The optimum natural ventilation performance for LSCCSD is achieved at a rise span ratio of 0.37. In addition, the lateral middle opening is kept higher than the ridge top of the coal pile. The proposed evaluation approach and design parameters provided instructive information in the building design and ventilation control for LSCCSDs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["computational fluid dynamics", "evaluation indicator", "large space circular coal storage dome", "natural ventilation performance", "opening mode"], "IndexKeywords": ["Computational fluid dynamics methods", "Evaluation approach", "Evaluation indicators", "Ventilation control", "Ventilation performance", "Wind pressure coefficient", "Wind pressure differences", "Wind-tunnel testing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85093530008", "SubjectAreas": [["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Energy (miscellaneous)", "ENER", "2101"]], "AuthorData": {"57215897405": {"Name": "Hou Y.", "AuthorID": "57215897405", "AffiliationID": "124128295", "AffiliationName": "Department of Fire Commanding, China People\u2019s Police University"}, "57215375495": {"Name": "Chen C.", "AuthorID": "57215375495", "AffiliationID": "60022281", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Green Built Environment and Energy Efficient Technology, Beijing University of Technology"}, "57215898439": {"Name": "Zhou Y.", "AuthorID": "57215898439", "AffiliationID": "60022281", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Green Built Environment and Energy Efficient Technology, Beijing University of Technology"}, "57219516532": {"Name": "Yang Z.", "AuthorID": "57219516532", "AffiliationID": "113229002", "AffiliationName": "Huadian Heavy Industries Co., Ltd."}, "55504215000": {"Name": "Wei S.", "AuthorID": "55504215000", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London"}}}
