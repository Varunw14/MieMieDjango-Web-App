A force is applied such that the atoms experience two consecutive Landau-Zener tunnelings while transversing the avoided crossings. St\u00fcckelberg interference arises from the phase accumulated during the adiabatic evolution between the two tunnelings. This phase is gauge field dependent and thus provides new opportunities to measure the synthetic gauge field, which is verified via calculation of spin transition probabilities after a double-passage process. Time-dependent and time-averaged spin probabilities are derived, in which resonances are found. We also demonstrate chiral Bloch oscillation and rich spin-momentum locking behavior in this system.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adiabatic evolution", "Avoided crossings", "Bloch oscillations", "Spin momentum", "Spin transition", "Time dependent", "Time evolutions", "Time-averaged"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092600575", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57215506378": {"Name": "Liang S.", "AuthorID": "57215506378", "AffiliationID": "60021200, 60073623", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Precision Spectroscopy, Department of Physics, School of Physics and Electronic Science, East China Normal University"}, "57211208441": {"Name": "Li Z.C.", "AuthorID": "57211208441", "AffiliationID": "60021200, 60073623", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Precision Spectroscopy, Department of Physics, School of Physics and Electronic Science, East China Normal University"}, "36097301900": {"Name": "Zhou L.", "AuthorID": "36097301900", "AffiliationID": "60002222", "AffiliationName": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Extreme Optics, Shanxi University"}, "34877948100": {"Name": "Zhang W.", "AuthorID": "34877948100", "AffiliationID": "60002222", "AffiliationName": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Extreme Optics, Shanxi University"}, "57216209901": {"Name": "Lan Z.", "AuthorID": "57216209901", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
