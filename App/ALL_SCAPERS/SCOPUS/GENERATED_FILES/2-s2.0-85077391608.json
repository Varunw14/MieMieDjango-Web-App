The present study describes a synthesis of qualitative data about mental and behavioural alterations associated with taking neuroleptics and how these interact with symptoms of psychosis and people\u2019s sense of self and agency. Methods: Nine databases were searched to identify qualitative literature concerning experiences of taking neuroleptic medication. A thematic synthesis was conducted. Results: Neuroleptics were commonly experienced as producing a distinctive state of lethargy, cognitive slowing, emotional blunting and reduced motivation, which impaired functioning but also had beneficial effects on symptoms of psychosis and some other symptoms (e.g. insomnia). For some people, symptom reduction helped restore a sense of normality and autonomy, but others experienced a loss of important aspects of their personality. Across studies, many people adopted a passive stance towards long-term medication, expressing a sense of resignation, endurance or loss of autonomy. Conclusions: Neuroleptic drugs modify cognition, emotions and motivation. These effects may be associated with reducing the intensity and impact of symptoms, but also affect people\u2019s sense of self and agency. Understanding how the effects of neuroleptics are experienced by those who take them is important in developing a more collaborative approach to drug treatment in psychosis and schizophrenia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antipsychotics", "Neuroleptics", "Psychosis", "Qualitative research", "Schizophrenia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Antipsychotic Agents", "Emotions", "Female", "Humans", "Lethargy", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Motivation", "Personal Autonomy", "Psychotic Disorders", "Qualitative Research", "Self Concept", "Treatment Outcome", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077391608", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57212441578": {"Name": "Thompson J.", "AuthorID": "57212441578", "AffiliationID": "60107401", "AffiliationName": "Research and Development Department, Goodmayes Hospital, North East London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57147831400": {"Name": "Stansfeld J.L.", "AuthorID": "57147831400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "55390090800": {"Name": "Crellin N.E.", "AuthorID": "55390090800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "57207838002": {"Name": "Moncrieff J.", "AuthorID": "57207838002", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "6603484587": {"Name": "Morant N.", "AuthorID": "6603484587", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "56054697200": {"Name": "Cooper R.E.", "AuthorID": "56054697200", "AffiliationID": "60022109, 60159384", "AffiliationName": "Unit for Social and Community Psychiatry, Newham Centre for Mental Health, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
