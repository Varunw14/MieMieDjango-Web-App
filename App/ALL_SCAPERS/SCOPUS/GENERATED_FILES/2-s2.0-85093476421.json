All rights reserved.In the era of constant redefinition of urban transportation patterns, alternative vehicle-sharing transportation systems, such as carsharing and bikesharing, gain increasing attention. In order to effectively deploy, maintain and develop these modes achieving maximum usage, companies and authorities need to understand the underlying factors that affect the demand. In this chapter, we review some of the most recent research papers that investigate the impact of demographic, environmental, economic and travel patterns that affect the adoption of vehicle-sharing systems. The successful adoption of vehicle-sharing systems relies on the effective deployment of stations. The most important exogenous factors that affect the vehicle-sharing systems adoption, as we identified in the literature, are population density, age, household size, education level, proximity to public transportation stations, land use, distance to Central Business District, distance to services, number of enterprises near the stations and vehicle availability. Punctuality of pickup at the origin and arrival at the destination are the most important factors for the acceptance of shared autonomous vehicle.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bikesharing", "Carsharing", "Factors affecting adoption", "Vehicle-sharing"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85093476421", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)", "ECON", "2000"], ["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"]], "AuthorData": {"55554420200": {"Name": "Efthymiou D.", "AuthorID": "55554420200", "AffiliationID": "60117650, 60019722", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Geo and Environmental Engineering, Technical University of Munich"}, "7004031914": {"Name": "Antoniou C.", "AuthorID": "7004031914", "AffiliationID": "60117650, 60019722", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Geo and Environmental Engineering, Technical University of Munich"}, "57060622700": {"Name": "Chaniotakis E.", "AuthorID": "57060622700", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Environment, Energy and Resources, University College London (UCL)"}}}
