Methods: Single molecule array measurements of neurofilament light (NfL) and heavy chain (pNfH) in 99 patients with genetically confirmed Friedreich\u2019s ataxia. Correlation of NfL/pNfH serum levels with disease severity, disease duration, age, age at onset, and GAA repeat length. Results: Median serum levels of NfL were 21.2 pg/ml (range 3.6\u201349.3) in controls and 26.1 pg/ml (0\u201378.1) in Friedreich\u2019s ataxia (p = 0.002). pNfH levels were 23.5 pg/ml (13.3\u201343.3) in controls and 92 pg/ml (3.1\u2013303) in Friedreich\u2019s ataxia (p = 0.0004). NfL levels were significantly increased in younger patients (age 16\u201331 years, p < 0.001) and patients aged 32\u201347 years (p = 0.008), but not in patients of age 48 years and older (p = 0.41). In a longitudinal assessment, there was no difference in NfL levels in 14 patients with repeated sampling 2 years after baseline measurement. Levels of NfL correlated inversely with GAA1 repeat length (r = \u2212 0.24, p = 0.02) but not with disease severity (r = \u2212 0.13, p = 0.22), disease duration (r = \u2212 0.06, p = 0.53), or age at onset (r = 0.05, p = 0.62). Conclusion: Serum levels of NfL and pNfH are elevated in Friedreich\u2019s ataxia, but differences to healthy controls decrease with increasing age. Long-term longitudinal data are required to explore whether this reflects a selection bias from early death of more severely affected individuals or a slowing down of the neurodegenerative process with age. In a pilot study over 2 years of follow-up\u2014a period relevant for biomarkers indicating treatment effects\u2014we found NfL levels to be stable.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomarker", "Friedreich\u2019s ataxia", "Neurofilament heavy chain", "Neurofilament light chain", "NfL", "pNfH"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078807653", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57193309728": {"Name": "Hayer S.N.", "AuthorID": "57193309728", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Research Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}, "23135382100": {"Name": "Liepelt I.", "AuthorID": "23135382100", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Research Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}, "42462485400": {"Name": "Wilke C.", "AuthorID": "42462485400", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Research Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}, "7005610155": {"Name": "Sch\u00f6ls L.", "AuthorID": "7005610155", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Research Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}, "56769534800": {"Name": "Barro C.", "AuthorID": "56769534800", "AffiliationID": "60028287, 60023588", "AffiliationName": "Neurologic Clinic and Policlinic, Departments of Medicine, Biomedicine and Clinical Research, University Hospital Basel, University of Basel"}, "8937520800": {"Name": "Kuhle J.", "AuthorID": "8937520800", "AffiliationID": "60028287, 60023588", "AffiliationName": "Neurologic Clinic and Policlinic, Departments of Medicine, Biomedicine and Clinical Research, University Hospital Basel, University of Basel"}, "57207901190": {"Name": "Martus P.", "AuthorID": "57207901190", "AffiliationID": "60017246", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Clinical Epidemiology and Applied Biometry, University of Tuebingen"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
