Multiplex immunohistochemistry (MIHC) is ideally suited to this task, enabling simultaneous assessment of a number of markers on a single section, thus reducing interpretive errors and preserving tissue for further analyses. The range of current and emerging MIHC platforms offer an opportunity to gain unprecedented insight into the cellular and immunological milieu of lymphoproliferative disease and have been applied in research. These include techniques which use more traditional chromogenic and fluorescent detection systems. They have been refined in the recent years with improved chemistries, iterative rounds of staining and advanced imaging techniques such as multispectral analysis. The newer generation of MIHC have overcome the limitations of the traditional techniques by utilizing novel detection systems such as imaging mass cytometry and molecular barcoding. In addition, by combining the identification of morphological features, large panels of proteins and mRNA transcripts into \u201cdigital spatial profiling\u201d, MIHC techniques are contributing to the in-situ \u2018multi-omic\u2019 approach to pathology. MIHC has improved our understanding in several areas of lymphoma pathology, in particular, the role of the immune microenvironment in pathogenesis, prognosis and treatment stratification. Despite the exciting opportunities offered by MIHC platforms, few are used in routine diagnostics, reflecting the need for validation studies in the clinical settings. This paper provides an overview of MIHC, with notable examples of application in the research of lymphoproliferative processes and some relating to potential use in routine diagnosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["digital spatial profiling", "immune checkpoint", "lymphoma", "multiplex immunohistochemistry"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089153235", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Histology", "MEDI", "2722"]], "AuthorData": {"57203691353": {"Name": "Pugh M.", "AuthorID": "57203691353", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University College London and Department of Cellular Pathology, University College Hospital London"}, "57218417324": {"Name": "Akarka A.U.", "AuthorID": "57218417324", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University College London and Department of Cellular Pathology, University College Hospital London"}, "57218417877": {"Name": "Hunter K.", "AuthorID": "57218417877", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University College London and Department of Cellular Pathology, University College Hospital London"}, "6603287463": {"Name": "Dojcinov S.", "AuthorID": "6603287463", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University College London and Department of Cellular Pathology, University College Hospital London"}, "7003959647": {"Name": "Marafioti T.", "AuthorID": "7003959647", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University College London and Department of Cellular Pathology, University College Hospital London"}}}
