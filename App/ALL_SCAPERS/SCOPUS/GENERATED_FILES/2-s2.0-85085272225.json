We build on a new approach to innovation policy, which we call market co-creating and shaping, in which the state is not only fixing markets but actively co-creating them. We also look at the legal institutions that determine (and are determined by) the relationship between public and private actors. Policy measures to institutionalize rewards in a way that promote more equitable public\u2013private partnerships can be understood as attempts to mediate asymmetric power relations, tensions and conflicting views among multiple stakeholders, as well as building a shared notion of the value and legitimacy of the role of the state. We conclude by outlining analytical and policy implications and identifying avenues for future research.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Entrepreneurial state", "Innovation policy", "Legal institutions", "Portfolio", "public\u2013private partnerships", "Risk capital"], "IndexKeywords": ["Innovation policies", "Legal institutions", "Multiple stakeholders", "Policy implications", "Power relations", "Private partnerships", "Public agencies", "Public investments"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085272225", "SubjectAreas": [["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Management Science and Operations Research", "DECI", "1803"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"57216915438": {"Name": "Laplane A.", "AuthorID": "57216915438", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "IIPP \u2013 Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose, University College London"}, "7003892124": {"Name": "Mazzucato M.", "AuthorID": "7003892124", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "IIPP \u2013 Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose, University College London"}}}
