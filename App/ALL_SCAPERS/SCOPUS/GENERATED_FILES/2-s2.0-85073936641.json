Cancer Survivorship", "Volume": "13", "Issue": 5, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 815, "PageEnd": 828, "CitedBy": 1, "DOI": "10.1007/s11764-019-00801-w", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85073936641&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2019, The Author(s).Purpose: The purpose of this study was to understand breast, prostate and colorectal cancer clinical nurse specialists\u2019 (CNSs) perspectives on physical activity (PA) promotion and the role of smartphone apps to support PA promotion in cancer care. Methods: CNSs working in breast, prostate or colorectal cancer were recruited via advertisements distributed by professional organizations. In-depth semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted and analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Nineteen CNSs participated. The analysis resulted in 4 themes regarding CNSs\u2019 perspectives of PA promotion within cancer care: (i) policy changes in survivorship care have influenced CNSs\u2019 promotion of PA; (ii) CNSs recognize their role in supporting PA but sit within a wider system necessary for effective PA promotion; (iii) CNSs use several techniques to promote PA within their consultations; (iv) remaining challenges in PA promotion. The analysis resulted in 3 themes regarding CNSs\u2019 perspectives on the use of apps to promote PA within cancer care: (i) the influence of apps on access to PA support; (ii) the role of apps in self-directed PA; (iii) implementing apps in cancer care. Conclusions: The results of this study provide valuable insight into the CNS role and provide a number of important considerations for the development and implementation of PA interventions within cancer care, with a specific focus on smartphone-based interventions. Implications for Cancer Survivors: CNSs play an important role in PA promotion in cancer care and this research can inform the development of PA interventions delivered via smartphone app for people affected by cancer.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer survivorship", "Intervention", "Nurse", "Oncology", "Physical activity", "Smartphone app"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Attitude of Health Personnel", "Exercise", "Exercise Therapy", "Female", "Health Promotion", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "Male", "Mobile Applications", "Neoplasms", "Nurse Clinicians", "Nurse's Role", "Oncology Nursing", "Perception", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Telephone", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073936641", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Oncology (nursing)", "NURS", "2917"]], "AuthorData": {"57195291841": {"Name": "Roberts A.L.", "AuthorID": "57195291841", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science & Health, University College London"}, "57197876396": {"Name": "Stevens C.", "AuthorID": "57197876396", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science & Health, University College London"}, "24071201800": {"Name": "Lally P.", "AuthorID": "24071201800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science & Health, University College London"}, "56660238600": {"Name": "Fisher A.", "AuthorID": "56660238600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science & Health, University College London"}, "12783188400": {"Name": "Potts H.W.W.", "AuthorID": "12783188400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}, "37117793800": {"Name": "Smith L.", "AuthorID": "37117793800", "AffiliationID": "60000913", "AffiliationName": "The Cambridge Centre for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Department of Life Sciences, Anglia Ruskin University"}}}
