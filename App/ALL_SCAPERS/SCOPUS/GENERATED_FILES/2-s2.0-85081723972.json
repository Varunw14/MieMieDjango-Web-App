People concerned about their sexual functioning may not seek help, and patients and health professionals can find it difficult to raise the topic. This intervention description paper details the aims, design and therapeutic rationale underpinning an interactive website which provides stand-alone, tailored advice and self-help for sexual difficulties. Sextherapylondon (STL) is an interactive digital intervention (IDI) offering evidence-based sex therapy including psychoeducation, cognitive-behavioural and systemic therapy techniques within a social constructionist framework. An online triage module identifies those who need clinical assessment before proceeding with online sex therapy, generating a referral letter. STL offers online self-help for getting or keeping erections, early ejaculation, sexual pain, difficulties with orgasm, and lack or loss of sexual desire. In this paper we describe the content and design of the STL web-based sex therapy programs, including the theoretical and therapeutic rationale which underpins the website structure and content. Sextherapylondon replicates key aspects of therapist-delivered sex therapy from a range of theoretical approaches, to provide tailored, personalised feedback. By offering private, convenient online access, interactive digital interventions can address the needs of people with sexual difficulties who may not otherwise receive help.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cognitive therapy", "couples therapy", "digital health", "erectile dysfunction", "Systemic therapy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081723972", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"37048821900": {"Name": "Gurney K.", "AuthorID": "37048821900", "AffiliationID": "60032993", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychologist and Psychosexologist, Chelsea and Westminster NHS Trust, Sexual Health Service"}, "37112124300": {"Name": "Hobbs L.J.", "AuthorID": "37112124300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychologist, e-Health Unit, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57215718471": {"Name": "Adams N.J.", "AuthorID": "57215718471", "AffiliationID": "60162114, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Consultant Clinical Psychologist, Central and North West London NHS Trust, Sexual Health Services, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "7404350273": {"Name": "Bailey J.V.", "AuthorID": "7404350273", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "e-Health Unit, Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
