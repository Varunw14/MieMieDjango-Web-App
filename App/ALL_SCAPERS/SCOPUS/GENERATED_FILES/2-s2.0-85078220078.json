Implementation science, the study of the translation of research into practice, can promote the uptake of existing effective interventions in routine clinical practice and aid the sustainable integration of psychological treatments with routine health care. The aim of this report was to use four implementation science methods to develop a version of an existing effective psychological treatment for mental health disorders [the Modular Approach to Treatment of Children with Anxiety, Depression or Conduct Problems (MATCH-ADTC)] for use within paediatric epilepsy services: (a) literature search; (b) iterative focus groups underpinned by normalisation process theory; (c) Plan\u2013Do\u2013Study\u2013Act methods; and (d) qualitative patient interviews. Findings: Three modifications were deemed necessary to facilitate implementation in children with both mental health disorders and epilepsy. These were (a) a universal brief psychoeducational component addressing the relationship between epilepsy and mental health; (b) supplementary, conditionally activated interventions addressing stigma, parental mental health and the transition to adulthood; and (c) additional training and supervision. The intervention needed relatively little alteration for implementation in paediatric epilepsy services. The modified treatment reflected the scientific literature and the views of clinicians and service users. The multi-method approach used in this report can serve as a model for implementation of evidence-based psychological treatments for children with mental health needs in the context of other chronic illnesses.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anxiety", "Behaviour", "Depression", "Epilepsy", "Implementation science"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078220078", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7003543961": {"Name": "Shafran R.", "AuthorID": "7003543961", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36968589700": {"Name": "Bennett S.", "AuthorID": "36968589700", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "25958950300": {"Name": "Coughtrey A.", "AuthorID": "25958950300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57214073153": {"Name": "Welch A.", "AuthorID": "57214073153", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57190178790": {"Name": "Walji F.", "AuthorID": "57190178790", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56347087500": {"Name": "Cross J.H.", "AuthorID": "56347087500", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7003916653": {"Name": "Heyman I.", "AuthorID": "7003916653", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57214068114": {"Name": "Dalrymple E.", "AuthorID": "57214068114", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice Research and Teaching Department, University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "6602286208": {"Name": "Varadkar S.", "AuthorID": "6602286208", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36626391300": {"Name": "Sibelli A.", "AuthorID": "36626391300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Health Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, Kings CollegeLondon"}, "55883806600": {"Name": "Moss-Morris R.", "AuthorID": "55883806600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Health Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, Kings CollegeLondon"}, "57215224446": {"Name": "Smith J.", "AuthorID": "57215224446", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King\u2019s College London"}, "57206477392": {"Name": "Ross J.", "AuthorID": "57206477392", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL Medical School (Royal Free Campus), University College London"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
