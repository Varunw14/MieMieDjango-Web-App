Methods: This is a randomized controlled trial (N = 495) of ATT assessment and ATT installation intervention, compared with control (restricted ATT package). ATT assessment and installation data were collected. Qualitative work identified value networks delivering ATT, established an ATT assessment standard. Results: ATT was delivered by public and not-for-profit telecare networks. ATT assessments showed 52% fidelity to the ATT assessment standard. Areas of assessment most frequently leading to identifying ATT need were daily activities (93%), memory (89%), and problem-solving (83%). ATT needs and recommendations were weakly correlated (\u03c4 = 0.242; P <.000), with ATT recommendations and installations moderately correlated (\u03c4 = \u22120.470; P <.000). Half (53%) of recommended technology was not installed. Safety concerns motivated 38% of installations. Discussion: Assessment recommendations were routinely disregarded at the point of installation. ATT was commonly recommended for safety and seldom for supporting leisure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Assessment of need", "Assistive technology", "ATTILA", "Community-dwelling", "Dementia", "Telecare"],
