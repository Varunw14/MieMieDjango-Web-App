Over the integers, this problem was shown decidable by Choffrut and Frigeri [Discret. Math. Theor. C., 12(1), pp. 21-38, 2010], albeit with non-elementary time complexity. Our contribution is to establish a full geometric characterisation of those sets definable without order which in turn enables us to prove coNP-completeness of this problem over the rationals and to establish an elementary upper bound over the integers. We also provide a complementary \u03a0P2 lower bound for the integer case that holds even in a fixed dimension. This lower bound is obtained by showing that universality for ultimately periodic sets, i.e., semilinear sets in dimension one, is \u03a0P2 -hard, which resolves an open problem of Huynh [Elektron. Inf.verarb. Kybern., 18(6), pp. 291-338, 1982].", "AuthorKeywords": ["Linear arithmetic theories", "Logical definability", "Numerical semigroups", "Semi linear sets", "Ultimately periodic sets"], "IndexKeywords": ["First-order formulas", "Integer arithmetic", "Linear arithmetic", "Lower bounds", "Order relation", "Semi-linear sets", "Time complexity", "Upper Bound"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089338211", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"35799547500": {"Name": "Chistikov D.", "AuthorID": "35799547500", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Discrete Mathematics and its Applications (DIMAP), Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick"}, "35090201500": {"Name": "Haase C.", "AuthorID": "35090201500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
