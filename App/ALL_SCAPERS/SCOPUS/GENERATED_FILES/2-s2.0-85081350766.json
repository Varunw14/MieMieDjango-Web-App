This study aimed at evaluating the therapeutic efficiency of topical application of Gap27, a Cx43 mimetic peptide, on corneal tissue reorganization during wound healing in streptozocin-induced Diabetes in albino rats and its effect on the infiltration of inflammatory cells. Fifty adult male albino Wistar rats were divided equally into two groups: non-diabetic and diabetic. Twenty rats from each group were subjected to corneal injury: 10 untreated and 10 treated with Gap27. The remaining five rats from each group served as negative controls (intact corneas). All rats were sacrificed 3 days after injury. Histological studies were performed to assess signs of cell degeneration, the infiltration of inflammatory cells. Histomorphometric studies were performed to quantify the expression of Cx43. Gap27 promoted corneal wound healing in non-diabetic and diabetic rats. It reduced mononuclear cell infiltration and improved corneal tissue remodeling. However, minor structural changes were still seen in diabetic corneas after treatment with Gap27. Blocking Cx43 was a valuable tool to restore corneal tissue structure, reduce the infiltration of inflammatory cells in non-diabetic and diabetic rats.", "AuthorKeywords": ["connexin 43", "cornea", "healing", "histopathology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081350766", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"55282959100": {"Name": "Elbadawy H.M.", "AuthorID": "55282959100", "AffiliationID": "60008920", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, Taibah University"}, "37058411400": {"Name": "Abdul M.I.M.", "AuthorID": "37058411400", "AffiliationID": "60008920", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, Taibah University"}, "55633654400": {"Name": "Aljuhani N.", "AuthorID": "55633654400", "AffiliationID": "60008920", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, Taibah University"}, "36609782500": {"Name": "Bahashwan S.", "AuthorID": "36609782500", "AffiliationID": "60008920", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, Taibah University"}, "56449223900": {"Name": "Eltahir H.M.", "AuthorID": "56449223900", "AffiliationID": "60008920", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, Taibah University"}, "56246649100": {"Name": "Elshawarby A.", "AuthorID": "56246649100", "AffiliationID": "60015323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histology and Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University"}, "55884458900": {"Name": "Raafat M.H.", "AuthorID": "55884458900", "AffiliationID": "60015323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histology and Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University"}, "57195328900": {"Name": "Bahaa N.", "AuthorID": "57195328900", "AffiliationID": "60015323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histology and Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University"}, "57194344444": {"Name": "Albarry M.", "AuthorID": "57194344444", "AffiliationID": "60008920", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, College of Medicine, Taibah University"}, "54795700400": {"Name": "Parekh M.", "AuthorID": "54795700400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57190211074": {"Name": "Ferrari S.", "AuthorID": "57190211074", "AffiliationID": "60172700", "AffiliationName": "International Center for Ocular Physiopathology, The Veneto Eye Bank Foundation"}}}
