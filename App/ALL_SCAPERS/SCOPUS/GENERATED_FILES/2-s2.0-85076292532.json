However, few data exist regarding the content of emerging THMs in drinking water, which are present at very low concentrations. This study aimed to monitor hazardous and emerging THMs from drinking water supply in a residential area via solid phase microextraction using gas chromatography. Response surface methodology was employed to evaluate the role of salt concentration, temperature, desorption and extraction times on THM formation as a result of raw water prechlorination. Maximum THM detection was achieved at 3.25 g Na2SO4 salt via 30 min extraction time at 80\u00b0C along with 8 min of desorption time. The quantification results revealed the presence of total THMs in all drinking water samples, while most of the sites (88%) exceeded the permissible limit set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). Among I-THMs, chloroiodomethane was found to be dominant as detected in 79% of samples.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Disinfection by-products", "Distribution network", "Response surface methodology", "Solid-phase microextraction", "Water analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chlorination byproducts", "Disinfection byproducts", "Drinking water distribution networks", "Drinking water samples", "Islamabad , Pakistan", "Response surface methodology", "Solid-phase microextraction", "United states environmental protection agencies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076292532", "SubjectAreas": [["Development", "SOCI", "3303"], ["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"], ["Waste Management and Disposal", "ENVI", "2311"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57194544573": {"Name": "Khan R.", "AuthorID": "57194544573", "AffiliationID": "60059937", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST)"}, "6507528374": {"Name": "Hashmi I.", "AuthorID": "6507528374", "AffiliationID": "60059937", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST)"}, "22954025200": {"Name": "Rasheed S.", "AuthorID": "22954025200", "AffiliationID": "117139577", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biotechnology, University of Kotli"}, "55076141700": {"Name": "Nasir H.", "AuthorID": "55076141700", "AffiliationID": "60059937", "AffiliationName": "School of Natural Sciences (SNS), National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST)"}, "14043273200": {"Name": "Campos L.C.", "AuthorID": "14043273200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}}}
