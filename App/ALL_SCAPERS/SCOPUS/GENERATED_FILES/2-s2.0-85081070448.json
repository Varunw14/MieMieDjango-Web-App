However, quantifying somatic evolution in humans remains challenging. Here, we show that multi-sample genomic data from a single time point of normal and cancer tissues contains information on single-cell divisions. We present a new theoretical framework that, applied to whole-genome sequencing data of healthy tissue and cancer, allows inferring the mutation rate and the cell survival/death rate per division. On average, we found that cells accumulate 1.14 mutations per cell division in healthy haematopoiesis and 1.37 mutations per division in brain development. In both tissues, cell survival was maximal during early development. Analysis of 131 biopsies from 16 tumours showed 4 to 100 times increased mutation rates compared to healthy development and substantial inter-patient variation of cell survival/death rates.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bayes Theorem", "Brain", "Cell Division", "Cell Survival", "Genetic Heterogeneity", "Hematopoiesis", "Humans", "Models, Genetic", "Mutation Accumulation", "Mutation Rate", "Neoplasms", "Neurons", "Reproducibility of Results", "Single-Cell Analysis", "Whole Genome Sequencing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081070448", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"54788610100": {"Name": "Werner B.", "AuthorID": "54788610100", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Evolutionary Dynamics Group, Centre for Cancer Genomics & Computational Biology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57202603449": {"Name": "Case J.", "AuthorID": "57202603449", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge"}, "57204012661": {"Name": "Chkhaidze K.", "AuthorID": "57204012661", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Evolutionary Genomics and Modelling Lab, Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "57200721042": {"Name": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Mateos J.", "AuthorID": "57200721042", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Evolutionary Genomics and Modelling Lab, Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "57188626663": {"Name": "Cresswell G.D.", "AuthorID": "57188626663", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Evolutionary Genomics and Modelling Lab, Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "56895867100": {"Name": "Nichol D.", "AuthorID": "56895867100", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Evolutionary Genomics and Modelling Lab, Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "35273708200": {"Name": "Spiteri I.", "AuthorID": "35273708200", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Evolutionary Genomics and Modelling Lab, Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "25947907300": {"Name": "Sottoriva A.", "AuthorID": "25947907300", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Evolutionary Genomics and Modelling Lab, Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "57061265800": {"Name": "Williams M.J.", "AuthorID": "57061265800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Mathematics and Physics in the Life Sciences and Experimental Biology (CoMPLEX), University College London"}, "57194546198": {"Name": "Temko D.", "AuthorID": "57194546198", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Evolution and Cancer Laboratory, Centre for Cancer Genomics & Computational Biology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University London"}, "57188748588": {"Name": "Cross W.", "AuthorID": "57188748588", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Evolution and Cancer Laboratory, Centre for Cancer Genomics & Computational Biology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University London"}, "26021895300": {"Name": "Graham T.A.", "AuthorID": "26021895300", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Evolution and Cancer Laboratory, Centre for Cancer Genomics & Computational Biology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University London"}, "57202058182": {"Name": "Barnes C.P.", "AuthorID": "57202058182", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Genetics Institute, University College London"}, "36126212000": {"Name": "Huang W.", "AuthorID": "36126212000", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematical Sciences, Queen Mary University London"}, "57216111061": {"Name": "Tomlinson I.P.M.", "AuthorID": "57216111061", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham"}}}
