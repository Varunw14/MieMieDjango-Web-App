The short-wave pattern has a wavelength of order 1.2 kpc in Rg or 285 kpc km s\u22121 in Lz. The pattern shows only weak changes with Galactocentric radius R and little change in strength in particular with the vertical energy Ez of the stars or the distance to the Galactic plane |z|. The pattern is to first order symmetric around the plane, i.e. has no significant odd terms in z. There is a weak phase shift with the pattern moving towards slightly lower Lz (i.e. trailing) with |z| and Ez. However, we observe a highly significant phase shift in Galactic azimuth \u03c6, which is different for different peaks. The peak around Lz \u223c 2100 kpc km s\u22121 only shows a weak change with \u03c6, while the rest of the pattern shows a clearly detectable shift of dLz/d\u03c6 = (200 \u00b1 22) kpc km s\u22121 rad\u22121. If we consider all peaks to belong to the same pattern, this would suggest a wavenumber m = 4. We further find that the wave-like pattern in Ug appears to be related to the W versus_ Lz pattern detected in Gaia DR1. A comparison of the Ug-Lz wave pattern with changes of Ug versus R,_ which have been previously discussed, suggests that the latter can be understood as just the Ug-Lz pattern washed out by blurring (i.e. orbital excursions around their guiding centre) of disc stars.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Galaxy: disc", "Galaxy: kinematics and dynamics", "Galaxy: structure", "Solar neighbourhood", "Stars: kinematics and dynamics"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079674242", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57215000577": {"Name": "Friske J.K.S.", "AuthorID": "57215000577", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Fakult\u00e4t f\u00fcr Physik, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t"}, "26642272800": {"Name": "Sch\u00f6nrich R.", "AuthorID": "26642272800", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}}}
