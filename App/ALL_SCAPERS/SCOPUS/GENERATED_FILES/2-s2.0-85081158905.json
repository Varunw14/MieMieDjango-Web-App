The frequency and intensity of WDR exposure are modified by climate change. Current approaches to exposure assessment emphasise prolonged exposure. Here, we propose indices to represent the exposure of cultural heritage to extreme WDR events. The indices are derived in two stages: (1) time-binning of long-term exposure, and (2) statistical representation of the occurrence of infrequent but intense events by fitting to the Generalised Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. A comparison to an existing exposure assessment procedure demonstrates that the proposed indices better represent shorter, more intense, and more consistent WDR events. Indices developed for seasons had greater statistical confidence than those developed for annual exposure. One index is contextualised within a model of a gutter on a terraced building: this converts the index from a measure of exposure to potential impact. This evaluation demonstrated the importance of maintenance to reduce the potential impact of WDR events. This work has direct and indirect implications for developing robust assessment procedures for cultural heritage exposure to extreme weather events.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Extreme value analysis", "Historic buildings", "Resilience", "Risk assessment", "Sustainability", "WDR"], "IndexKeywords": ["Building performance", "Extreme value analysis", "Extreme weather events", "Historic buildings", "Resilience", "Statistical confidence", "Statistical representations", "Wind-driven rain (WDR)"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081158905", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (miscellaneous)", "ENVI", "2301"]], "AuthorData": {"57215732261": {"Name": "Orr S.A.", "AuthorID": "57215732261", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage, University College London"}, "15119218500": {"Name": "Cassar M.", "AuthorID": "15119218500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage, University College London"}}}
