Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.There are no published studies of fertility measurements in people living with perinatally acquired HIV (PaHIV). We performed fertility investigations in 25 adults with PaHIV. Seven (78%) men had sperm morphology normal forms (%) below the fifth centile for the general population with four (44%) having no normal forms. Mean (SD) serum anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone level was 19.4 (9.5) pmol/l; lower than expected for this age group. A larger study is needed to verify our findings.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85099324954", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57195075315": {"Name": "Pasvol T.J.", "AuthorID": "57195075315", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "57221504246": {"Name": "Teh J.", "AuthorID": "57221504246", "AffiliationID": "60011848, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Trials Centre, St Mary's Hospital, Imperial College London"}, "57221503514": {"Name": "Hall R.", "AuthorID": "57221503514", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "57219969871": {"Name": "Petersen C.", "AuthorID": "57219969871", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "57221503663": {"Name": "Khan M.", "AuthorID": "57221503663", "AffiliationID": "60011848, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Trials Centre, St Mary's Hospital, Imperial College London"}, "57201568964": {"Name": "Fidler S.", "AuthorID": "57201568964", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "55173859700": {"Name": "Balfoussia D.", "AuthorID": "55173859700", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Andrology, Hammersmith Hospital & Section of Investigative Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "57208059783": {"Name": "Ayres S.", "AuthorID": "57208059783", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "8207226900": {"Name": "Jayasena C.N.", "AuthorID": "8207226900", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Andrology, Hammersmith Hospital & Section of Investigative Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "57221503646": {"Name": "Foster C.", "AuthorID": "57221503646", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}}}
