It remained unclear whether Cdk9 and H2Bub1 cooperate to regulate the expression of individual genes. Here, we show that Cdk9 inhibition or H2Bub1 loss induces intragenic antisense transcription of \u223c10% of fission yeast genes, with each perturbation affecting largely distinct subsets; ablation of both pathways de-represses antisense transcription of over half the genome. H2Bub1 and phospho-Spt5 have similar genome-wide distributions; both modifications are enriched, and directly proportional to each other, in coding regions, and decrease abruptly around the cleavage and polyadenylation signal (CPS). Cdk9-dependence of antisense suppression at specific genes correlates with high H2Bub1 occupancy, and with promoter-proximal RNAPII pausing. Genetic interactions link Cdk9, H2Bub1 and the histone deacetylase Clr6-CII, while combined Cdk9 inhibition and H2Bub1 loss impair Clr6-CII recruitment to chromatin and lead to decreased occupancy and increased acetylation of histones within gene coding regions. These results uncover novel interactions between co-transcriptional histone modification pathways, which link regulation of RNAPII transcription elongation to suppression of aberrant initiation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cell Cycle Proteins", "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9", "Histones", "Phosphorylation", "RNA Polymerase II", "Schizosaccharomyces", "Schizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins", "Transcription Elongation, Genetic", "Transcriptional Elongation Factors", "Ubiquitination"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088495866", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"9237353400": {"Name": "Sans\u00f3 M.", "AuthorID": "9237353400", "AffiliationID": "116541611", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Genomics Group, Vall d\u2019Hebron Institute of Oncology"}, "36931024900": {"Name": "Parua P.K.", "AuthorID": "36931024900", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}, "7403556563": {"Name": "Fisher R.P.", "AuthorID": "7403556563", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}, "57218260085": {"Name": "Pinto D.", "AuthorID": "57218260085", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, McGill University"}, "14060900000": {"Name": "Pag\u00e9 V.", "AuthorID": "14060900000", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, McGill University"}, "57217623479": {"Name": "MacKinnon S.", "AuthorID": "57217623479", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, McGill University"}, "7003670250": {"Name": "Tanny J.C.", "AuthorID": "7003670250", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, McGill University"}, "55510892500": {"Name": "Peter Svensson J.", "AuthorID": "55510892500", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biosciences and Nutrition, Karolinska Institutet"}, "23983920600": {"Name": "Bitton D.A.", "AuthorID": "23983920600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Genetics, Evolution & Environment, University College"}, "6603788294": {"Name": "B\u00e4hler J.", "AuthorID": "6603788294", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Genetics, Evolution & Environment, University College"}, "57197004980": {"Name": "Garcia P.", "AuthorID": "57197004980", "AffiliationID": "60032942", "AffiliationName": "Departament de Ci\u00e8nces Experimentals i de la Salut, Universitat Pompeu Fabra"}, "16189859800": {"Name": "Hidalgo E.", "AuthorID": "16189859800", "AffiliationID": "60032942", "AffiliationName": "Departament de Ci\u00e8nces Experimentals i de la Salut, Universitat Pompeu Fabra"}}}
