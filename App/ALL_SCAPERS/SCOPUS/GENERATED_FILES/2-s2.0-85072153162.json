Karger AG, Basel. All rights reserved.In mammals, fertility critically depends on the pulsatile secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) by scattered hypothalamic neurons (GnRH neurons). During development, GnRH neurons originate in the nasal placode and migrate first into the nasal compartment and then through the nasal/forebrain junction, before they reach their final position in the hypothalamus. This neurodevelopmental process, which has been extensively studied in mouse models, is regulated by a plethora of factors that might control GnRH neuron migration or survival as well as the fasciculation/targeting of the olfactory/vomeronasal axons along which the GnRH neurons migrate. Defects in GnRH neuron development or release can lead to isolated GnRH deficiency, with the underlying genetic causes still being partially unknown. Recently, semaphorins and their receptors neuropilins and plexins, a large family of molecules implicated in neuronal development and plasticity, are emerging as key regulators of GnRH neuron biology and deficiency. Specifically, semaphorins have been shown to play different roles in GnRH neuron biology by regulating migration and survival during embryonic development as well as secretion in adulthood.", "AuthorKeywords": ["GnRH deficiency", "Neuron development", "Semaphorin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone", "Humans", "Hypothalamus", "Neurons", "Semaphorins", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072153162", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"], ["Endocrine and Autonomic Systems", "NEUR", "2807"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"57191746515": {"Name": "Oleari R.", "AuthorID": "57191746515", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacological and Biomolecular Sciences, University of Milan"}, "37034481900": {"Name": "Lettieri A.", "AuthorID": "37034481900", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacological and Biomolecular Sciences, University of Milan"}, "57210988640": {"Name": "Paganoni A.", "AuthorID": "57210988640", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacological and Biomolecular Sciences, University of Milan"}, "57210988847": {"Name": "Zanieri L.", "AuthorID": "57210988847", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacological and Biomolecular Sciences, University of Milan"}, "6507318934": {"Name": "Cariboni A.", "AuthorID": "6507318934", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacological and Biomolecular Sciences, University of Milan"}}}
