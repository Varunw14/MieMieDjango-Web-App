The Work Group for the European Reference Network for Kidney Diseases (ERKNet) and the European Society for Pediatric Nephrology (ESPN) has developed consensus statement on genetic aspects of CNS diagnosis and management. The presented expert opinion recommends genetic diagnostics as the key diagnostic test to be ordered already during the initial evaluation of the patient, discusses which phenotyping workup should be performed and presents known genotype\u2013phenotype correlations.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085508985", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"57203005023": {"Name": "Lipska-Zi\u0119tkiewicz B.S.", "AuthorID": "57203005023", "AffiliationID": "60012383", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rare Diseases, Medical University of Gda\u0144sk"}, "57203846844": {"Name": "Ozaltin F.", "AuthorID": "57203846844", "AffiliationID": "60011512", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Nephrology and Nephrogenetics Laboratory, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine"}, "8095087600": {"Name": "H\u00f6ltt\u00e4 T.", "AuthorID": "8095087600", "AffiliationID": "60000113, 60016987, 60020970", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Nephrology and Transplantation, The New Children\u2019s Hospital, HUS Helsinki University Hospital"}, "6602980434": {"Name": "Bockenhauer D.", "AuthorID": "6602980434", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Renal Medicine and Renal Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56941489800": {"Name": "Webb H.", "AuthorID": "56941489800", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Renal Medicine and Renal Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56512205400": {"Name": "B\u00e9rody S.", "AuthorID": "56512205400", "AffiliationID": "60026877, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Nephrology, Reference Center for Hereditary Kidney Diseases (MARHEA), Necker Hospital, APHP"}, "8509255100": {"Name": "Boyer O.", "AuthorID": "8509255100", "AffiliationID": "60123804, 60123796, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Hereditary Kidney Diseases, Imagine Institute, INSERM, Paris Descartes University"}, "6701308902": {"Name": "Levtchenko E.", "AuthorID": "6701308902", "AffiliationID": "60031069, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pediatric Nephrology, Department of Pediatrics, University Hospitals Leuven; Department of Development & Regeneration, University of Leuven"}, "7006724852": {"Name": "Vivarelli M.", "AuthorID": "7006724852", "AffiliationID": "60017905", "AffiliationName": "Division of Nephrology and Dialysis, Department of Pediatric Subspecialties, Bambino Ges\u00f9 Pediatric Hospital and Research Center"}, "7005877632": {"Name": "Haffner D.", "AuthorID": "7005877632", "AffiliationID": "60024052", "AffiliationName": "Center for Congenital Kidney Diseases, Center for Rare Diseases, Hannover Medical School"}, "34572934300": {"Name": "Schaefer F.", "AuthorID": "34572934300", "AffiliationID": "106730955", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pediatric Nephrology, Center for Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine"}}}
