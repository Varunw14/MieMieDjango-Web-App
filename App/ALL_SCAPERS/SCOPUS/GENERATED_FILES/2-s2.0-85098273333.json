Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.Ultrasound is typically measured using phase-sensitive piezoelectric sensors. Interest in phase-insensitive sensors has grown recently, with proposed applications including ultrasound attenuation tomography of the breast and acoustic power measurement. One advantage of phase-insensitive detectors, in contrast to conventional phase-sensitive detectors, is that they do not suffer from a narrow directional response at high frequencies due to phase cancellation. A numerical model of a phase-insensitive pyroelectric ultrasound sensor is presented. The model consists of three coupled components run in sequence: acoustic, thermal, and electrical. The acoustic simulation models the propagation and absorption of the incident ultrasound wave. The absorbed acoustic power density is used as a heat source in the thermal simulation of the time-evolution of the temperature in the sensor. Both the acoustic and thermal simulations are performed using the k-Wave MATLAB toolbox with an assumption that shear waves are not supported in the medium. The final component of the model is a pyroelectric circuit model which outputs the sensor response based on the temperature change in the sensor. The modelled pyroelectric sensor response and directional dependence are compared to empirical data.", "AuthorKeywords": ["directional response", "directionality", "numerical model", "pyroelectricity", "ultrasound sensor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic power density", "Acoustic simulations", "Directional dependence", "Directional response", "Phase sensitive detectors", "Piezoelectric sensors", "Pyroelectric sensors", "Ultrasound attenuation tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85098273333", "SubjectAreas": [["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Engineering (miscellaneous)", "ENGI", "2201"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"57219546461": {"Name": "Kaupinm\u00e4ki S.", "AuthorID": "57219546461", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7403198742": {"Name": "Cox B.", "AuthorID": "7403198742", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005759823": {"Name": "Arridge S.", "AuthorID": "7005759823", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "55801129500": {"Name": "Baker C.", "AuthorID": "55801129500", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics Department, National Physical Laboratory"}, "24171953000": {"Name": "Sinden D.", "AuthorID": "24171953000", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics Department, National Physical Laboratory"}, "6701630009": {"Name": "Zeqiri B.", "AuthorID": "6701630009", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics Department, National Physical Laboratory"}}}
