Methods: A review protocol was developed according to the (PRISMA-P) checklist, registered in the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO) and published. A literature search in 4 databases was performed using the keywords \u2018glioma\u2019 and \u2018diffusional kurtosis\u2019. After applying a robust inclusion/exclusion criteria, included articles were independently evaluated according to the QUADAS-2 tool and data extraction was done. Reported sensitivities and specificities were used to construct 2 \u00d7 2 tables and paired forest plots using the Review Manager (RevMan\u00ae) software. A random-effect model was pursued using the hierarchical summary receiver operator characteristics. Results: A total of 216 hits were retrieved. Considering duplicates and inclusion criteria, 23 articles were eligible for full-text reading. Ultimately, 19 studies were eligible for final inclusion. The quality assessment revealed 9 studies with low risk of bias in the 4 domains. Using a bivariate random-effect model for data synthesis, summary ROC curve showed a pooled area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92 and estimated sensitivity of 0.87 (95% CI 0.78\u20130.92) in high-/low-grade gliomas\u2019 differentiation. A mean difference in mean kurtosis (MK) value between HGG and LGG of 0.22 (95% CI 0.25\u20130.19) was illustrated (p value = 0.0014) with moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 73.8%). Conclusion: DKI shows good diagnostic accuracy in the differentiation of high- and low-grade gliomas further supporting its potential role in clinical practice. Further exploration of DKI in differentiating IDH status and in characterising non-glioma CNS tumours is however needed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diagnosis", "Diffusion-weighted imaging", "Gliomas", "Magnetic resonance imaging"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085135672", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57205141011": {"Name": "Abdalla G.", "AuthorID": "57205141011", "AffiliationID": "124444526", "AffiliationName": "Imaging Analysis Centre"}, "57217769634": {"Name": "Dixon L.", "AuthorID": "57217769634", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery UCL Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "25822819700": {"Name": "Sanverdi E.", "AuthorID": "25822819700", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery UCL Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "7006486284": {"Name": "Yousry T.", "AuthorID": "7006486284", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery UCL Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "14627355000": {"Name": "Bisdas S.", "AuthorID": "14627355000", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery UCL Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "57217503658": {"Name": "Abdel-Khalek A.M.", "AuthorID": "57217503658", "AffiliationID": "60012022", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Mansoura university hospitals"}, "6505530937": {"Name": "Settein M.", "AuthorID": "6505530937", "AffiliationID": "60012022", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Mansoura university hospitals"}, "35243075300": {"Name": "Machado P.M.", "AuthorID": "35243075300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases & Centre for Rheumatology, University College London"}, "57200043686": {"Name": "Kwong J.S.W.", "AuthorID": "57200043686", "AffiliationID": "60002798", "AffiliationName": "Jockey Club School of Public Health and Primary Care, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"}, "55390602700": {"Name": "Panovska-Griffiths J.", "AuthorID": "55390602700", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health and Development, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "36834426700": {"Name": "Rojas-Garcia A.", "AuthorID": "36834426700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR CLAHRC North Thames, Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "55632392200": {"Name": "Yoneoka D.", "AuthorID": "55632392200", "AffiliationID": "60178602", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health Policy, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo"}, "36199096900": {"Name": "Veraart J.", "AuthorID": "36199096900", "AffiliationID": "60012937", "AffiliationName": "imec-Vision Lab, Department of Physics, University of Antwerp"}, "15833492200": {"Name": "Van Cauter S.", "AuthorID": "15833492200", "AffiliationID": "60031069", "AffiliationName": "University Hospitals Leuven"}}}
