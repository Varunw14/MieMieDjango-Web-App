Simulations of an individual-based model reveal at least three distinct large-scale patterns: travelling bands, trails and moving clusters. This motivates the derivation of a macroscopic partial differential equations model for the interactions between the self-propelled particles and the obstacles, for which we assume large tether stiffness. The result is a coupled system of nonlinear, non-local partial differential equations. Linear stability analysis shows that patterning is expected if the interactions are strong enough and allows for the predictions of pattern size from model parameters. The macroscopic equations reveal that the obstacle interactions induce short-ranged SPP aggregation, irrespective of whether obstacles and SPPs are attractive or repulsive.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gradient flow", "Hydrodynamic limit", "Non-local interactions", "Pattern formation", "Self-propelled particles", "Stability analysis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091497069", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"]], "AuthorData": {"55319471400": {"Name": "Aceves-Sanchez P.", "AuthorID": "55319471400", "AffiliationID": "60004923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, North Carolina State University"}, "7005668908": {"Name": "Degond P.", "AuthorID": "7005668908", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Imperial College London"}, "8911450800": {"Name": "Keaveny E.E.", "AuthorID": "8911450800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Imperial College London"}, "57188856699": {"Name": "Manhart A.", "AuthorID": "57188856699", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "51565595600": {"Name": "Merino-Aceituno S.", "AuthorID": "51565595600", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University of Sussex"}, "56955729600": {"Name": "Peurichard D.", "AuthorID": "56955729600", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60072945", "AffiliationName": "Inria Paris - MAMBA Project Team, Laboratory Jacques-Louis Lions, Sorbonne University"}}}
