In Argentina, possible cases date from ca. 1000\u20131400 Common Era (CE). This paper describes the oldest (905\u20131030 CE) confirmed case of tuberculosis (TB) in a young adult male from Lomitas de Saujil (Tinogasta, Catamarca, Argentina). Osteolytic lesions on the bodies of the lower spine were macroscopically and radiographically identified. Bilateral new bone formation was seen on the visceral vertebral third of several ribs and in long bones, compatible with hypertrophic osteoarthropathy. Representative rib and hand bones gave profiles for MTC-specific C27\u2013C32 mycocerosic acid lipid biomarkers; these were strongest in one heavily-lesioned lower rib, which also had MTC-diagnostic C76\u2013C89 mycolic acids and positive amplification of MTC-typical IS6110 aDNA fragments. During the first millennium CE, the intense social interaction, the spatial circumscription of villages among the pre-Hispanic societies in the mesothermal valleys of Catamarca and the fluid contacts with the Eastern lowlands, valleys and puna, were factors likely to favor disease transmission. It is proposed that TB arrived from northern Chile and dispersed towards the northeast into the Yocavil valley, where several cases of TB infection were macroscopically identified for a later chronology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Infectious diseases", "M. tuberculosis complex (MTC)", "Paleopathology", "Pott's disease", "Pre-hispanic populations", "Tuberculous spondylitis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091227996", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"14621810000": {"Name": "Luna L.H.", "AuthorID": "14621810000", "AffiliationID": "60004518", "AffiliationName": "CONICET-IMHICIHU, Multidisciplinary Institute of History and Human Sciences"}, "56344601600": {"Name": "Aranda C.M.", "AuthorID": "56344601600", "AffiliationID": "60001563", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Odontology, University of Buenos Aires"}, "13204856100": {"Name": "Santos A.L.", "AuthorID": "13204856100", "AffiliationID": "60106449, 60020985", "AffiliationName": "Research Centre for Anthropology and Health (CIAS), Department of Life Sciences, University of Coimbra"}, "6701847443": {"Name": "Donoghue H.D.", "AuthorID": "6701847443", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Microbiology, University College London"}, "25628230800": {"Name": "Lee O.Y.C.", "AuthorID": "25628230800", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Microbiology and Infection, School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham"}, "55325032400": {"Name": "Wu H.H.T.", "AuthorID": "55325032400", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Microbiology and Infection, School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham"}, "7004651537": {"Name": "Besra G.S.", "AuthorID": "7004651537", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Microbiology and Infection, School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham"}, "7006174144": {"Name": "Minnikin D.E.", "AuthorID": "7006174144", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Microbiology and Infection, School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham"}, "7005051243": {"Name": "Llewellyn G.", "AuthorID": "7005051243", "AffiliationID": "60170471", "AffiliationName": "National Mass Spectrometry Facility, Swansea University Medical School"}, "57206940636": {"Name": "Williams C.M.", "AuthorID": "57206940636", "AffiliationID": "60170471", "AffiliationName": "National Mass Spectrometry Facility, Swansea University Medical School"}, "6506061100": {"Name": "Ratto N.", "AuthorID": "6506061100", "AffiliationID": "60001563, 60004518", "AffiliationName": "University of Buenos Aires, Institute of Cultures (IDECU, UBA-CONICET), Faculty of Philosophy and Letters"}}}
