This solution is obtained as the vanishing viscosity limit of classical solutions of the one-dimensional, isentropic, compressible Navier\u2013Stokes equations. Our approach relies on the method of compensated compactness to pass to the limit rigorously in the nonlinear terms. Key to our strategy is the derivation of hyperbolic representation formulas for the entropy kernel and related quantities; among others, a special entropy pair used to obtain higher uniform integrability estimates on the approximate solutions. Intricate bounding procedures relying on these representation formulas then yield the required compactness of the entropy dissipation measures. In turn, we prove that the Young measure generated by the classical solutions of the Navier\u2013Stokes equations reduces to a Dirac mass, from which we deduce the required convergence to a solution of the Euler equations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Compensated compactness", "Entropy solution", "Euler equations", "Navier\u2013Stokes equations", "Relative finite-energy", "Representation formula"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086458119", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"57201433406": {"Name": "Schrecker M.R.I.", "AuthorID": "57201433406", "AffiliationID": "60032179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University of Wisconsin Madison"}, "57209136602": {"Name": "Schulz S.", "AuthorID": "57209136602", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Mathematics, University of Cambridge"}}}
