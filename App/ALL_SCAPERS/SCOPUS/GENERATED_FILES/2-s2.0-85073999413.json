Clinical Transplantation published by John Wiley & Sons LtdBackground and aims: This multicenter trial compared immediate-release tacrolimus (IR-T) vs prolonged-release tacrolimus (PR-T) in de novo kidney, liver, and heart transplant recipients aged <16 years. Each formulation had similar pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles. Follow-up efficacy and safety results are reported herein. Materials and methods: Patients, randomized 1:1, received once-daily, PR-T or twice-daily, IR-T within 4 days of surgery. After a 4-week PK assessment, patients continued randomized treatment for 48 additional weeks. At Year 1, efficacy assessments included the number of clinical acute rejections, biopsy-confirmed acute rejection (BCAR) episodes (including severity), patient and graft survival, and efficacy failure (composite of death, graft loss, BCAR, or unknown outcome). Adverse events were assessed throughout. Results: The study included 44 children. At Year 1, mean \u00b1 standard deviation tacrolimus trough levels were 6.6 \u00b1 2.2 and 5.4 \u00b1 1.6 ng/mL, and there were 2 and 7 acute rejection episodes in the PR-T and IR-T groups, respectively. No cases of graft loss or death were reported during the study. The overall efficacy failure rate was 18.2% (PR-T n = 1; IR-T n = 7). Conclusions: In pediatric de novo solid organ recipients, the low incidence of BCAR and low efficacy failure rate suggest that PR-T-based immunosuppression is effective and well tolerated to 1-year post-transplantation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["calcineurin inhibitor: tacrolimus", "heart (allograft) function/dysfunction", "immunosuppressant", "kidney transplantation: living donor", "liver transplantation: living donor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Graft Rejection", "Graft Survival", "Humans", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Male", "Organ Transplantation", "Postoperative Complications", "Prognosis", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Survival Rate", "Tacrolimus", "Transplant Recipients"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073999413", "SubjectAreas": [["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"6603032157": {"Name": "Vondrak K.", "AuthorID": "6603032157", "AffiliationID": "60023469", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital Motol"}, "7006775777": {"Name": "Parisi F.", "AuthorID": "7006775777", "AffiliationID": "60017905", "AffiliationName": "Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Ges\u00f9"}, "24545802400": {"Name": "Dhawan A.", "AuthorID": "24545802400", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "King's College Hospital"}, "13606275800": {"Name": "Grenda R.", "AuthorID": "13606275800", "AffiliationID": "60087496", "AffiliationName": "The Children's Memorial Health Institute"}, "7102172274": {"Name": "Webb N.J.A.", "AuthorID": "7102172274", "AffiliationID": "60120605", "AffiliationName": "Manchester University Foundation Trust"}, "8889557300": {"Name": "Marks S.D.", "AuthorID": "8889557300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004317787": {"Name": "Debray D.", "AuthorID": "7004317787", "AffiliationID": "60026877, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "APHP-H\u00f4pital Universitaire Necker"}, "55174018600": {"Name": "Holt R.C.L.", "AuthorID": "55174018600", "AffiliationID": "60024418", "AffiliationName": "Alder Hey Children's Hospital"}, "55005319500": {"Name": "Lachaux A.", "AuthorID": "55005319500", "AffiliationID": "60012357, 60023578", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Lyon 1 et Hospices Civils de Lyon"}, "57203588678": {"Name": "Kelly D.", "AuthorID": "57203588678", "AffiliationID": "60022357", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Women's & Children's Hospital"}, "24335221300": {"Name": "Kazeem G.", "AuthorID": "24335221300", "AffiliationID": "121500601", "AffiliationName": "BENKAZ Consulting Ltd"}, "55958577900": {"Name": "Undre N.", "AuthorID": "55958577900", "AffiliationID": "60111592", "AffiliationName": "Astellas Pharma Europe Ltd"}}}
