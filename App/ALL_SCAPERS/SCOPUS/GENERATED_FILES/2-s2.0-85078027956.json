They have proven effective in both academic and industrial settings. ACO algorithms share many features among them. Isula encapsulates these commonalities and exposes them for reuse in the form of a Java library. In this paper, we use the travelling salesman problem and image segmentation to showcase the framework capabilities using three top-performing ACO algorithms implemented in Isula. This framework is an open-source project available at GitHub, where is currently the most popular ACO java repository.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ant colony optimisation", "Image segmentation", "Java", "Travelling salesman problem"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078027956", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"57211216134": {"Name": "Gavidia-Calderon C.", "AuthorID": "57211216134", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Computer Science"}, "55602499700": {"Name": "Beltr\u00e1n Casta\u00f1on C.", "AuthorID": "55602499700", "AffiliationID": "60071236", "AffiliationName": "Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru, Department of Engineering"}}}
