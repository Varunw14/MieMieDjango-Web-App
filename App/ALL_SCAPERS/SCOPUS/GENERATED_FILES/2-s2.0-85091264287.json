Many countries are already experiencing the challenges of managing an ageing population, including increased pension contributions from workers, rises to national retirement ages, and spiralling healthcare costs. In oral health terms, in addition to simply an ageing population, epidemiological studies have demonstrated significant changes in the oral health of older adults in recent years. As the numbers of edentulous older adults has declined, there has been a significant increase in the number of partially dentate elderly. Changing attitudes, improved access to dental care and more effective preventative programmes have meant that large numbers of patients are now retaining natural teeth into old age. However, as older patients retain natural teeth for longer, the dental profession is charged with controlling chronic dental diseases in an increasingly challenging oral environment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ageing", "chronic disease", "epidemiology", "older patients", "oral health", "population"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Humans", "Oral Health"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091264287", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"23091524900": {"Name": "McKenna G.", "AuthorID": "23091524900", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "Senior Lecturer/Consultant in Restorative Dentistry, Centre for Public Health, Queen's University Belfast"}, "57204336866": {"Name": "Tsakos G.", "AuthorID": "57204336866", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Professor of Dental Public Health, Faculty of Population Health Sciences, University College London"}, "13907181000": {"Name": "Burke F.", "AuthorID": "13907181000", "AffiliationID": "60025160", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine and Health, University College Cork"}, "57203031131": {"Name": "Brocklehurst P.", "AuthorID": "57203031131", "AffiliationID": "60025779", "AffiliationName": "Professor in Health Services Research, School of Health Sciences, Bangor University"}}}
