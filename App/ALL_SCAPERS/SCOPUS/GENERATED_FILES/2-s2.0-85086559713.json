Gipps, B. McCallum and E. Hargreaves.We know that successful teachers need to use a range of teaching strategies, but what are they? Bringing together fascinating, first-hand accounts of teaching, assessment and feedback strategies used by 'expert'teachers, this Routledge Classic Edition is an indispensable guide for teachers and trainee teachers looking to extend their skills and improve their practice. With a brand new foreword from Margaret Brown to contextualise the book within the field today, this accessible and concise text illustrates good teaching practice, offering a range of rich case studies and first-hand narratives. Chapters investigate a number of key areas, including the most common lesson patterns and when to use them, how teaching strategies are varied according to subject, and how assessment and feedback can encourage pupils to learn.
