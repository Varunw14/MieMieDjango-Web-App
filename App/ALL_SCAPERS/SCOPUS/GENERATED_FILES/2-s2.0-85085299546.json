Axonal injury is a major underlying mechanism of TBI and could represent a major therapeutic target. We provide evidence that targeting the axonal death pathway known as Wallerian degeneration improves outcome in a Drosophila Melanogaster model of high impact trauma. This cell-autonomous neurodegenerative pathway is initiated following axon injury, and in Drosophila, involves activity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase highwire. We demonstrate that a loss-of-function mutation in the highwire gene rescues deleterious effects of a traumatic injury, including\u2014improved functional outcomes, lifespan, survival of dopaminergic neurons, and retention of synaptic proteins. This data suggests that highwire represents a potential therapeutic target in traumatic injury.", "AuthorKeywords": ["axons", "highwire", "neuroprotection", "traumatic brain injury", "wallerian degeneration"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085299546", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"16746373000": {"Name": "Hill C.S.", "AuthorID": "16746373000", "AffiliationID": "60000661", "AffiliationName": "The Babraham Institute"}, "55828150204": {"Name": "Loreto A.", "AuthorID": "55828150204", "AffiliationID": "60120904, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "John van Geest Centre for Brain Repair, University of Cambridge"}, "57212261333": {"Name": "Coleman M.P.", "AuthorID": "57212261333", "AffiliationID": "60000661", "AffiliationName": "The Babraham Institute"}, "12787944700": {"Name": "Sreedharan J.", "AuthorID": "12787944700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "7101687199": {"Name": "Menon D.K.", "AuthorID": "7101687199", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Wolfson Brain Imaging Centre, University of Cambridge"}}}
