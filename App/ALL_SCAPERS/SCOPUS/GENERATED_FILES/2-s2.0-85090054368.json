Here, we study a series of molecular dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone and fluorene oligomers as well-defined model systems to probe the relationship between photocatalytic activity and structural features such as chain length and planarity. The hydrogen evolution rate was found to vary significantly with bridge head atom, chain length, and backbone twisting. A trimer (S3) of only three repeat units has excellent activity for proton reduction with an EQE of 8.8% at 420 nm, approaching the activity of its polymer analogue and demonstrating that high molar masses are not a prerequisite for good activity. The dynamics of long-lived electrons generated under illumination in the S3 oligomer are very similar to the corresponding polymer, both under transient and quasi-continuous irradiation conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Conjugated oligomer", "Hydrogen evolution rate", "Irradiation conditions", "Polymeric networks", "Proton reduction", "Semiconductor photocatalyst", "Structural feature", "Structure activity relationships"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090054368", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"57195561146": {"Name": "Aitchison C.M.", "AuthorID": "57195561146", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool"}, "36632642600": {"Name": "Little M.A.", "AuthorID": "36632642600", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool"}, "56926651800": {"Name": "Brownbill N.J.", "AuthorID": "56926651800", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Stephenson Institute for Renewable Energy, University of Liverpool"}, "36716338700": {"Name": "Kane C.M.", "AuthorID": "36716338700", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool"}, "57213368290": {"Name": "Blanc F.", "AuthorID": "57213368290", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Stephenson Institute for Renewable Energy, University of Liverpool"}, "36657600800": {"Name": "Sprick R.S.", "AuthorID": "36657600800", "AffiliationID": "60024724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pure and Applied Chemistry, University of Strathclyde, Thomas Graham Building"}, "7401832651": {"Name": "Cooper A.I.", "AuthorID": "7401832651", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool"}, "57190578139": {"Name": "Sachs M.", "AuthorID": "57190578139", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Centre for Processable Electronics, Imperial College London"}, "57207806454": {"Name": "Durrant J.R.", "AuthorID": "57207806454", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Centre for Processable Electronics, Imperial College London"}, "56516768100": {"Name": "Wilbraham L.", "AuthorID": "56516768100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6507121537": {"Name": "Zwijnenburg M.A.", "AuthorID": "6507121537", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
