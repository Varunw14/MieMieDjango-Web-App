Methods: A mathematical model for the transmission of SARS-CoV2 in London. The model was parametrised using data on notified cases, deaths, contacts, and mobility to analyse the epidemic in the UK capital. We investigated the impact of multiple non pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and combinations of these measures on future incidence of COVID-19. Results: Immediate action at the early stages of an epidemic in the affected districts would have tackled spread. While an extended lockdown is highly effective, other measures such as shielding older populations, universal testing and facemasks can all potentially contribute to a reduction of infections and deaths. However, based on current evidence it seems unlikely they will be as effective as continued lockdown. In order to achieve elimination and lift lockdown within 5 months, the best strategy seems to be a combination of weekly universal testing, contact tracing and use of facemasks, with concurrent lockdown. This approach could potentially reduce deaths by 48% compared with continued lockdown alone. Conclusions: A combination of NPIs such as universal testing, contact tracing and mask use while under lockdown would be associated with least deaths and infections. This approach would require high uptake and sustained local effort but it is potentially feasible as may lead to elimination in a relatively short time scale.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age Factors", "Betacoronavirus", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Coronavirus Infections", "Health Policy", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Infection Control", "London", "Middle Aged", "Models, Statistical", "Pandemics", "Pneumonia, Viral", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085765791", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"56152846100": {"Name": "Gosc\u00e9 L.", "AuthorID": "56152846100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Global Health"}, "57217021047": {"Name": "Phillips P.A.", "AuthorID": "57217021047", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Global Health"}, "57217017057": {"Name": "Spinola P.", "AuthorID": "57217017057", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Global Health"}, "57217018629": {"Name": "Gupta D.R.K.", "AuthorID": "57217018629", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Global Health"}, "6602338051": {"Name": "Abubakar P.I.", "AuthorID": "6602338051", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Global Health"}}}
