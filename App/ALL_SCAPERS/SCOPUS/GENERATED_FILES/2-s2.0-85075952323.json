This paper analyses that problem through the lens of three overarching types of evidence available to researchers and policymakers: Type 1 evidence, which provides descriptions of the scope of social problems; Type 2 evidence measuring the impacts of programmes addressing those problems; and Type 3 evidence of the mechanisms through which programme impacts are realised. Whereas ALN was once characterised by a lack of Type 1 evidence of ALN problems and Type 2 evaluative evidence of programme impacts, there is now an abundance of these evidence types. However, ALN finds itself in an \u2018evidence impasse\u2019: it repeatedly appears that programmes aimed at improving ALN skills do not do so. This impasse may be the product of evaluation failure, not programme failure. I argue that evaluations should place greater emphasis on the production and analysis of Type 3 evidence of the mechanisms through which adult basic skills may be improved over time. This paper outlines a strategy for doing so, with a particular emphasis on long-term impact of literacy and numeracy practices on basic skills.", "AuthorKeywords": ["basic skills", "evaluation", "Literacy practices", "literacy skills", "PIAAC"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075952323", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Life-span and Life-course Studies", "SOCI", "3319"]], "AuthorData": {"55840623300": {"Name": "Carpentieri J.", "AuthorID": "55840623300", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, Practice and Society, University College London (UCL) Institute of Education"}}}
