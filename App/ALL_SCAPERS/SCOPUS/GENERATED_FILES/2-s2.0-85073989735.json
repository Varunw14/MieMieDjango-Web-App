Poor uterine development will render the individual vulnerable in the context of fertility. We assessed uterine size using ultrasound in those who had undergone pubertal induction treatment compared with a reference group who had experienced spontaneous puberty. Design: This is a single-centre, retrospective, cross-sectional study of women who underwent pubertal induction compared with a reference group. Patients: Ninety-five women with hypogonadism who had previously undergone pubertal induction and were receiving maintenance oestrogen replacement as adults were recruited: 48 women with Turner syndrome, 32 with premature ovarian insufficiency and 15 with gonadotrophin deficiency. The reference group consisted of 35 nulliparous women attending with male factor subfertility with a normal pelvis on ultrasonography. Measurements: Pelvic ultrasound was performed by a single observer. Uterine dimensions (total length, anterior\u2013posterior (AP), transverse, uterine volume and fundal cervical AP ratio (FCR) measurements) were recorded. Clinical details were also recorded. Results: Those with hypogonadism had significantly reduced uterine dimensions compared with the reference group (uterine length 64 mm vs 71 mm P = <.05, uterine volume 28.9 mL vs 43.9 mL P = <.05). All women in the reference group attained a mature uterine configuration with a FCR >1, compared with 84% of those with hypogonadism (P =.01). A total of 24% and 48% of the diagnostic group had total uterine length and uterine volume measurements less than the 5th percentile of the reference group, respectively. In a subgroup of 22 women in whom serum oestradiol concentrations could be analysed, there was a positive correlation between this parameter and uterine volume. Conclusion: Despite standard oestrogen therapy, uterine growth is often compromised in those with hypogonadism. Uterine health has historically been overlooked in pubertal induction protocols; however, with increasing options for fertility treatment, adequate uterine development is crucial. Given the variation in uterine size witnessed, a more tailored approach to treatment with regular monitoring of uterine dimensions should be advocated.", "AuthorKeywords": ["hypogonadism", "ovarian insufficiency", "pubertal induction", "Turner syndrome", "uterus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Hypogonadism", "Puberty", "Retrospective Studies", "Sexual Maturation", "Turner Syndrome", "Uterus", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073989735", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"54410111400": {"Name": "Burt E.", "AuthorID": "54410111400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Reproductive Medicine Unit, Institute for Women's Health, University College London Hospitals"}, "7404207971": {"Name": "Davies M.C.", "AuthorID": "7404207971", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Reproductive Medicine Unit, Institute for Women's Health, University College London Hospitals"}, "6503970828": {"Name": "Yasmin E.", "AuthorID": "6503970828", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Reproductive Medicine Unit, Institute for Women's Health, University College London Hospitals"}, "57196187080": {"Name": "Cameron-Pimblett A.", "AuthorID": "57196187080", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Reproductive Medicine Unit, Institute for Women's Health, University College London Hospitals"}, "17135521400": {"Name": "Mavrelos D.", "AuthorID": "17135521400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Reproductive Medicine Unit, Institute for Women's Health, University College London Hospitals"}, "32868104400": {"Name": "Talaulikar V.", "AuthorID": "32868104400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Reproductive Medicine Unit, Institute for Women's Health, University College London Hospitals"}, "35475924300": {"Name": "Conway G.S.", "AuthorID": "35475924300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Reproductive Medicine Unit, Institute for Women's Health, University College London Hospitals"}}}
