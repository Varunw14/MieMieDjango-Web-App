This work proposes a computational model that incorporates the dependencies between four states (tiredness, anxiety, pain, and engagement)known to appear in virtual rehabilitation sessions of post-stroke patients, to improve the automatic recognition of the patients' states. A dataset of five stroke patients which includes their fingers' pressure (PRE), hand movements (MOV)and facial expressions (FAE)during ten sessions of virtual rehabilitation was used. Our computational proposal uses the Semi-Naive Bayesian classifier (SNBC)as base classifier in a multiresolution approach to create a multimodal model with the three sensors (PRE, MOV, and FAE)with late fusion using SNBC (FSNB classifier). There is a FSNB classifier for each state, and they are linked in a circular classifier chain (CCC)to exploit the dependency relationships between the states. Results of CCC are over 90% of ROC AUC for the four states. Relationships of mutual exclusion between engagement and all the other states and some co-occurrences between pain and anxiety for the five patients were detected. Virtual rehabilitation platforms that incorporate the automatic recognition of multiple patient's states could leverage intelligent and empathic interactions to promote adherence to rehabilitation exercises.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Automatic affective states recognition", "Classifier chains", "Multi-label classification", "Stroke", "Virtual rehabilitation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Affective state", "Classifier chains", "Multi label classification", "Stroke", "Virtual rehabilitation"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077795961", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"], ["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"]], "AuthorData": {"56519318700": {"Name": "Rivas J.J.", "AuthorID": "56519318700", "AffiliationID": "60030699", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Nacional de Astrofisica, Optica y Electr\u00f3nica (INAOE), Computer Science Department"}, "22986331300": {"Name": "Orihuela-Espina F.", "AuthorID": "22986331300", "AffiliationID": "60030699", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Nacional de Astrofisica, Optica y Electr\u00f3nica (INAOE), Computer Science Department"}, "8312922300": {"Name": "Sucar L.E.", "AuthorID": "8312922300", "AffiliationID": "60030699", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Nacional de Astrofisica, Optica y Electr\u00f3nica (INAOE), Computer Science Department"}, "23007289500": {"Name": "Williams A.", "AuthorID": "23007289500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College of London (UCL)"}, "6602671345": {"Name": "Bianchi-Berthouze N.", "AuthorID": "6602671345", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College of London (UCL)"}}}
