We stratify according to previous psychosocial working conditions to identify short-term and long-term changes in mental health. Method: Using data from the Whitehall II study on British civil servants who retired during follow-up (n = 4,751), we observe mental health (General Health Questionnaire [GHQ] score) on average 8.2 times per participant, spanning up 37 years. We differentiate short-term (0-3 years) and long-term (4+ years) changes in mental health according to retirement and investigate whether trajectories differ by psychosocial job demands, work social support, decision authority, and skill discretion. Results: Each year, mental health slightly improved before retirement (-0.070; 95% CI [-0.080, -0.059]; higher values on the GHQ score are indicative of worse mental health), and retirees experienced a steep short-term improvement in mental health after retirement (-0.253; 95% CI [-0.302, -0.205]), but no further significant long-term changes (0.017; 95% CI [-0.001, 0.035]). Changes in mental health were more explicit when retiring from poorer working conditions; this is higher psychosocial job demands, lower decision authority, or lower work social support. Discussion: Retirement was generally beneficial for health. The association between retirement and mental health was dependent on the context individuals retire from.", "AuthorKeywords": ["General Health Questionnaire", "Longitudinal analysis", "Occupational cohort study", "Work exit", "Working environment"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Female", "Government Employees", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Mental Health", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Psychology", "Retirement", "Risk Factors", "Social Support", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United Kingdom", "Workplace"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077946847", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Life-span and Life-course Studies", "SOCI", "3319"]], "AuthorData": {"56149457200": {"Name": "Fleischmann M.", "AuthorID": "56149457200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "ESRC International Centre for Lifecourse Studies in Society and Health (ICLS), Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "57194344521": {"Name": "Xue B.", "AuthorID": "57194344521", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "ESRC International Centre for Lifecourse Studies in Society and Health (ICLS), Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7202619429": {"Name": "Head J.", "AuthorID": "7202619429", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
