Most go unrecognised and unopposed, but in some cases, they have provoked reactions and movements that reject or resist them. In this article we focus on one such movement of resistance, consisting of a network of families (the \u2018opt out\u2019 movement) that is boycotting the Standard Assessment Tests of primary education in Catalonia. We draw on exploratory research based on in-depth interviews with six of these families, as well as a review of articles, websites and documents produced by or about the movement. The participation of these families is examined in the light of Foucault\u2019s notion of resistance in two different respects: resistance as a \u2018tactical reversal\u2019 and refusal as an \u2018aesthetics of existence\u2019. We begin with an outline of the global ideological context in which the Standard Assessment Tests are set, and then examine the background to the opt out movement\u2019s resistance to the Standard Assessment Tests in Catalonia. This is followed by a Foucauldian analysis of this resistance, and then a description of the methodology used and the families interviewed. We make no significant empirical claims in the paper but rather seek to theorise certain paradoxes and tensions in relation to opting out and end with some remarks on the significance of the movement.", "AuthorKeywords": ["families", "Foucault", "opt out movement", "resistance", "Standard Assessment Tests"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077160999", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"55327770800": {"Name": "Collet-Sab\u00e9 J.", "AuthorID": "55327770800", "AffiliationID": "60068634", "AffiliationName": "University of Vic \u2013 UCC (Barcelona)"}, "7202536805": {"Name": "Ball S.J.", "AuthorID": "7202536805", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
