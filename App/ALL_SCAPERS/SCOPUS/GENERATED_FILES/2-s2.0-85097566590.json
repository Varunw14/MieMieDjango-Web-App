All rights reserved.Visual systems can exploit spatial correlations in the visual scene by using retinotopy, the organizing principle by which neighboring cells encode neighboring spatial locations. However, retinotopy is often lost, such as when visual pathways are integrated with other sensory modalities. How is spatial information processed outside of strictly visual brain areas? Here, we focused on visual looming responsive LC6 cells in Drosophila, a population whose dendrites collectively cover the visual field, but whose axons form a single glomerulus\u2014a structure without obvious retinotopic organization\u2014in the central brain. We identified multiple cell types downstream of LC6 in the glomerulus and found that they more strongly respond to looming in different portions of the visual field, unexpectedly preserving spatial information. Through EM reconstruction of all LC6 synaptic inputs to the glomerulus, we found that LC6 and downstream cell types form circuits within the glomerulus that enable spatial readout of visual features and contralateral suppression\u2014mechanisms that transform visual information for behavioral control.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85097566590", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"57193252224": {"Name": "Morimoto M.M.", "AuthorID": "57193252224", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "6506319936": {"Name": "Nern A.", "AuthorID": "6506319936", "AffiliationID": "60001224", "AffiliationName": "Janelia Research Campus, Howard Hughes Medical Institute"}, "57220740933": {"Name": "Zhao A.", "AuthorID": "57220740933", "AffiliationID": "60001224", "AffiliationName": "Janelia Research Campus, Howard Hughes Medical Institute"}, "57217462639": {"Name": "Rogers E.M.", "AuthorID": "57217462639", "AffiliationID": "60001224", "AffiliationName": "Janelia Research Campus, Howard Hughes Medical Institute"}, "7403147634": {"Name": "Wong A.M.", "AuthorID": "7403147634", "AffiliationID": "60001224", "AffiliationName": "Janelia Research Campus, Howard Hughes Medical Institute"}, "57220744210": {"Name": "Isaacson M.D.", "AuthorID": "57220744210", "AffiliationID": "60007776", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Cornell University"}, "23471923100": {"Name": "Bock D.D.", "AuthorID": "23471923100", "AffiliationID": "60009500", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurological Sciences, University of Vermont"}, "36818042000": {"Name": "Rubin G.M.", "AuthorID": "36818042000", "AffiliationID": "60001224", "AffiliationName": "Janelia Research Campus, Howard Hughes Medical Institute"}, "7201932972": {"Name": "Reiser M.B.", "AuthorID": "7201932972", "AffiliationID": "60001224", "AffiliationName": "Janelia Research Campus, Howard Hughes Medical Institute"}}}
