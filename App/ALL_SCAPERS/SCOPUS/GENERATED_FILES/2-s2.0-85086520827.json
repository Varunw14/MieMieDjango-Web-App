The main bonding interactions of molecules in these structures are estimated by the density functional theory calculations. The determined interaction energies are further used as a starting point for Monte Carlo simulations performed for a broad range of interaction parameters and different deprotonation levels of molecules. In this paper, we use the molecular engineering approach by selecting the sets of molecules with different deprotonation levels to obtain the structures similar to those observed experimentally. For a large number of once-deprotonated molecules, we obtain a discrete pinwheel phase, PW1, which can also coexist with the knitted pinwheel structure, PW2, if completely deprotonated molecules participate in the self-assembly. The PW1 phase could also be formed of twice-deprotonated molecules, and coexistence of this phase with the PW2 structure is possible for strong binding intermolecular interactions. We demonstrate domains of different enantiomers occurring in the PW1 and PW2 structures.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bonding interactions", "Interaction energies", "Interaction parameters", "Intermolecular interactions", "Model and simulation", "Molecular engineering", "Nearest neighbor model", "Strong binding"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086520827", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"]], "AuthorData": {"16039216300": {"Name": "Ibenskas A.", "AuthorID": "16039216300", "AffiliationID": "60105695", "AffiliationName": "Center for Physical Sciences and Technology"}, "56962710000": {"Name": "Tornau E.E.", "AuthorID": "56962710000", "AffiliationID": "60105695", "AffiliationName": "Center for Physical Sciences and Technology"}, "55865561500": {"Name": "\u0160imenas M.", "AuthorID": "55865561500", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Physics, Vilnius University"}, "57205887347": {"Name": "Kizlaitis K.J.", "AuthorID": "57205887347", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Physics, Vilnius University"}}}
