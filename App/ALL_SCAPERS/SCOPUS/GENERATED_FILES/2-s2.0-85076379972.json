Methods: In total, 708 participants (aged [mean\u00b1SD] 73 \u00b1 7 years, 56% male) were recruited from the Southall and Brent Revisited (SABRE) study, a UK population-based cohort comprised of Europeans (n = 311) and South Asian (n = 232) and African Caribbean (n = 165) migrants. Measurements of exercise capacity using a 6 min stepper test (6MST), including measurement of oxygen consumption (V\u0307 O 2) and grip strength, were performed. Skeletal muscle was assessed using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS); measures included changes in tissue saturation index (\u2206TSI%) with exercise and oxidative capacity (muscle oxygen consumption recovery, represented by a time constant [\u03c4]). Analysis was by multiple linear regression. Results: When adjusted for age and sex, in South Asians and African Caribbeans, exercise capacity was reduced compared with Europeans (V\u0307 O 2 [ml min\u22121 kg\u22121]: \u03b2 = \u22121.2 [95% CI \u20131.9, \u22120.4], p = 0.002, and \u03b2 \u22121.7 [95% CI \u20132.5, \u22120.8], p < 0.001, respectively). South Asians had lower and African Caribbeans had higher strength compared with Europeans (strength [kPa]: \u03b2 = \u22129 [95% CI \u201312, \u22126), p < 0.001, and \u03b2 = 6 [95% CI 3, 9], p < 0.001, respectively). South Asians had greater decreases in TSI% and longer \u03c4 compared with Europeans (\u2206TSI% [%]: \u03b2 = \u22120.9 [95% CI \u20131.7, \u22120.1), p = 0.024; \u03c4 [s]: \u03b2 = 11 [95% CI 3, 18], p = 0.006). Ethnic differences in V\u0307 O 2 and grip strength remained despite adjustment for type 2 diabetes or HbA1c (and fat-free mass for grip strength). However, the differences between Europeans and South Asians were no longer statistically significant after adjustment for other possible mediators or confounders (including physical activity, waist-to-hip ratio, cardiovascular disease or hypertension, smoking, haemoglobin levels or \u03b2-blocker use). The difference in \u2206TSI% between Europeans and South Asians was marginally attenuated after adjustment for type 2 diabetes or HbA1c and was also no longer statistically significant after adjusting for other confounders; however, \u03c4 remained significantly longer in South Asians vs Europeans despite adjustment for all confounders. Conclusions/interpretation: Reduced exercise capacity in South Asians and African Caribbeans is unexplained by higher rates of type 2 diabetes. Poorer exercise tolerance in these populations, and impaired muscle function and perfusion in South Asians, may contribute to the higher morbidity burden of UK ethnic minority groups in older age.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ethnicity", "Exercise capacity", "Skeletal muscle", "Type 2 diabetes"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076379972", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"]], "AuthorData": {"55383197700": {"Name": "Jones S.", "AuthorID": "55383197700", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL, Department of Population Science and Experimental Medicine, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "8878251700": {"Name": "Tillin T.", "AuthorID": "8878251700", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL, Department of Population Science and Experimental Medicine, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "57188677136": {"Name": "Williams S.", "AuthorID": "57188677136", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL, Department of Population Science and Experimental Medicine, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "57205524308": {"Name": "Eastwood S.V.", "AuthorID": "57205524308", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL, Department of Population Science and Experimental Medicine, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "57207789660": {"Name": "Hughes A.D.", "AuthorID": "57207789660", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL, Department of Population Science and Experimental Medicine, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "35412645300": {"Name": "Chaturvedi N.", "AuthorID": "35412645300", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL, Department of Population Science and Experimental Medicine, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}}}
