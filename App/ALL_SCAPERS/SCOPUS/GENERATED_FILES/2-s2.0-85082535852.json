Three distinct flame stages were observed \u2014 planar, chaotic and trident, which were strongly correlated to the flow dynamics. The effect of the flow on the flame behaviour was investigated by characterizing the cold flow in a scaled-up model channel with the same aspect ratio as the combustion micro-channel. Direct flow visualization using flow tracers and quantitative velocity-field data from PIV measurements showed both an increase in the bottom recirculation zone reattachment length (along the floor of the channel) and a decrease in the lateral recirculation zone reattachment length (along the sides of the channel) with increasing flow Reynolds number. Comparison of the flow and flame transition locations downstream of the injection point suggested that the location of trident flame onset coincides with the flow bottom recirculation zone reattachment length. The planar-chaotic flame transition location was observed to be influenced by the homogeneity of the mixture downstream of the injection plane.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acetylene-air", "Backward-facing step", "Flame dynamics", "Micro-channelled combustor", "PIV", "Premixed combustion", "Recirculation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Backward facing step", "Experimental investigations", "Flame dynamics", "Premixed combustion", "Reattachment length", "Recirculations", "Rectangular channel", "Velocity field data"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082535852", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Nuclear Energy and Engineering", "ENER", "2104"], ["Aerospace Engineering", "ENGI", "2202"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes", "CENG", "1507"]], "AuthorData": {"57216316629": {"Name": "Gupta A.", "AuthorID": "57216316629", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Clean Energy Processes (CEP) Laboratory, Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "57210927291": {"Name": "Koutita K.", "AuthorID": "57210927291", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Clean Energy Processes (CEP) Laboratory, Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "54941411200": {"Name": "Zadrazil I.", "AuthorID": "54941411200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Clean Energy Processes (CEP) Laboratory, Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "8287822500": {"Name": "Markides C.N.", "AuthorID": "8287822500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Clean Energy Processes (CEP) Laboratory, Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "55489741100": {"Name": "Qadri U.A.", "AuthorID": "55489741100", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge"}, "55536127300": {"Name": "Hussain T.", "AuthorID": "55536127300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "10640872700": {"Name": "Balachandran R.", "AuthorID": "10640872700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
