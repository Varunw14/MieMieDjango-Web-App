Different clusterings are optimal on the same data set according to different criteria, and the choice of such criteria depends on the context and aim of clustering. Therefore, researchers need to consider what data analytic characteristics the clusters they are aiming at are supposed to have, among others within-cluster homogeneity, between-clusters separation, and stability. Here, a set of internal clustering validity indexes measuring different aspects of clustering quality is proposed, including some indexes from the literature. Users can choose the indexes that are relevant in the application at hand. In order to measure the overall quality of a clustering (for comparing clusterings from different methods and/or different numbers of clusters), the index values are calibrated for aggregation. Calibration is relative to a set of random clusterings on the same data. Two specific aggregated indexes are proposed and compared with existing indexes on simulated and real data.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Between-clusters separation", "Cluster stability", "Number of clusters", "Random clustering", "Within-cluster homogeneity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086883638", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"]], "AuthorData": {"57217228069": {"Name": "Akhanli S.E.", "AuthorID": "57217228069", "AffiliationID": "60018872", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, Faculty of Science, Mu\u011fla S\u0131tk\u0131 Ko\u00e7man University"}, "57196610402": {"Name": "Hennig C.", "AuthorID": "57196610402", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Sciences \u201cPaolo Fortunati\u201d, University of Bologna"}}}
