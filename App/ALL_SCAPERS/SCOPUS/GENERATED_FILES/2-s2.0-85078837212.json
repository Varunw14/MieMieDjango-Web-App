Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimOptical theranostic applications demand near-infrared (NIR) localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and maximized electric field at nanosurfaces and nanojunctions, aiding diagnosis via Raman or optoacoustic imaging, and photothermal-based therapies. To this end, multiple permutations and combinations of plasmonic nanostructures and molecular \u201cglues\u201d or linkers are employed to obtain nanoassemblies, such as nanobranches and core\u2013satellite morphologies. An advanced nanoassembly morphology comprising multiple linear tentacles anchored onto a spherical core is reported here. Importantly, this core-multi-tentacle-nanoassembly (CMT) benefits from numerous plasmonic interactions between multiple 5 nm gold nanoparticles (NPs) forming each tentacle as well as tentacle to core (15 nm) coupling. This results in an intense LSPR across the \u201cbiological optical window\u201d of 650\u22121100 nm. It is shown that the combined interactions are responsible for the broadband LSPR and the intense electric field, otherwise not achievable with core\u2013satellite morphologies. Further the sub 80 nm CMTs boosted NIR-surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), with detection of SERS labels at 47 \u00d7 10-9 m, as well as lower toxicity to noncancerous cell lines (human fibroblast Wi38) than observed for cancerous cell lines (human breast cancer MCF7), presents itself as an attractive candidate for use as biomedical theranostics agents.", "AuthorKeywords": ["branched polymers", "broadband NIR absorbance", "cell toxicity", "core\u2013satellites", "plasmonic nanoassemblies", "surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Branched Polymer", "Cell toxicity", "Nano-assemblies", "NIR absorbance", "Surface enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS)"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078837212", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"56830132900": {"Name": "Dey P.", "AuthorID": "56830132900", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Exeter"}, "55484476700": {"Name": "Tabish T.A.", "AuthorID": "55484476700", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Exeter"}, "7003602571": {"Name": "Palombo F.", "AuthorID": "7003602571", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Exeter"}, "7202511172": {"Name": "Stone N.", "AuthorID": "7202511172", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Exeter"}, "56950221700": {"Name": "Mosca S.", "AuthorID": "56950221700", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Central Laser Facility, Research Complex at Harwell, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK Research and Innovation"}, "7005659005": {"Name": "Matousek P.", "AuthorID": "7005659005", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Central Laser Facility, Research Complex at Harwell, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK Research and Innovation"}}}
