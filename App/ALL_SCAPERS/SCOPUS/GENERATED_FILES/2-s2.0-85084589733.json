Massive galaxies with more extended stellar mass distributions tend to live in more massive dark matter haloes.We explain this connection with a phenomenological model that assumes, (1) a tight relation between the halo mass and the total stellar content in the halo, (2) that the fraction of in situ and ex situ mass at r <10 kpc depends on halo mass. This model provides an excellent description of the stellar mass functions (SMFs) of total stellar mass (Mmax\u2217) and stellar mass within inner 10 kpc (M10\u2217) and also reproduces the HSC weak lensing signals of massive galaxies with different stellar mass distributions. The best-fitting model shows that halo mass varies significantly at fixed total stellar mass (as much as 0.4 dex) with a clear dependence on M10\u2217. Our two-parameter Mmax\u2217-M10\u2217description provides a more accurate picture of the galaxy-halo connection at the high-mass end than the simple stellar-halo mass relation (SHMR) and opens a new window to connect the assembly history of haloes with those of central galaxies. The model also predicts that the ex situ component dominates the mass profiles of galaxies at r < 10 kpc for logM \u226511.7.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Elliptical and lenticular, cD-galaxies", "Formation", "Galaxies", "Galaxies", "Galaxies", "Galaxies", "Haloes", "Photometry", "Structure"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084589733", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"34969312900": {"Name": "Huang S.", "AuthorID": "34969312900", "AffiliationID": "60003269", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astrophysical Sciences, Princeton University"}, "22834640300": {"Name": "Leauthaud A.", "AuthorID": "22834640300", "AffiliationID": "60024941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, University of California Santa Cruz"}, "56585435600": {"Name": "Bradshaw C.", "AuthorID": "56585435600", "AffiliationID": "60024941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, University of California Santa Cruz"}, "57062800500": {"Name": "Ardila F.", "AuthorID": "57062800500", "AffiliationID": "60024941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, University of California Santa Cruz"}, "35113292900": {"Name": "Hearin A.", "AuthorID": "35113292900", "AffiliationID": "60028609", "AffiliationName": "Argonne National Laboratory"}, "17433715300": {"Name": "Behroozi P.", "AuthorID": "17433715300", "AffiliationID": "60010065", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy and Steward Observatory, University of Arizona"}, "54684988000": {"Name": "Speagle J.", "AuthorID": "54684988000", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy, Harvard University"}, "56152658800": {"Name": "Tenneti A.", "AuthorID": "56152658800", "AffiliationID": "60027950", "AffiliationName": "McWilliams Center for Cosmology, Department of Physics, Carnegie Mellon University"}, "56217161600": {"Name": "Bundy K.", "AuthorID": "56217161600", "AffiliationID": "60024941", "AffiliationName": "UCO/Lick Observatory, University of California Santa Cruz"}, "7402743629": {"Name": "Greene J.", "AuthorID": "7402743629", "AffiliationID": "60003269", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astrophysical Sciences, Princeton University"}, "7006701905": {"Name": "Bahcall N.", "AuthorID": "7006701905", "AffiliationID": "60003269", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astrophysical Sciences, Princeton University"}, "55078409700": {"Name": "Sif\u00f3n C.", "AuthorID": "55078409700", "AffiliationID": "60023520", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Fisica, Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Valparaiso"}}}
