Initial trials explored both viral and non-viral vectors but failed to achieve a significant breakthrough. However, in recent years, new opportunities have emerged that exploit our increased knowledge and understanding of the biology of CF and the airway epithelium. New technologies include new viral and non-viral vector approaches to delivery, but also alternative nucleic acid technologies including oligonucleotides and siRNA approaches for gene silencing and gene splicing, described in this review, as presented at the 2019 annual European CF Society Basic Science meeting (Dubrovnik, Croatia). We also briefly discuss other emerging technologies including mRNA and CRISPR gene editing that are advancing rapidly. The future prospects for genetic therapies for CF are now diverse and more promising probably than any time since the discovery of the CF gene.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antisense oligonucleotides", "CFTR", "Cystic fibrosis", "ENaC", "Gene therapy", "Liposomes", "mRNA splicing", "Nanoparticles", "siRNA"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077695172", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"24785866200": {"Name": "Christopher Boyd A.", "AuthorID": "24785866200", "AffiliationID": "100517283", "AffiliationName": "UK Cystic Fibrosis Gene Therapy Consortium"}, "7403649903": {"Name": "Guo S.", "AuthorID": "7403649903", "AffiliationID": "60000871", "AffiliationName": "Antisense Drug Discovery, Ionis Pharmaceuticals"}, "55413166500": {"Name": "Huang L.", "AuthorID": "55413166500", "AffiliationID": "60000871", "AffiliationName": "Antisense Drug Discovery, Ionis Pharmaceuticals"}, "35376353800": {"Name": "Kerem B.", "AuthorID": "35376353800", "AffiliationID": "60007903", "AffiliationName": "SpliSenseTherapeutics, Givat Ram Campus, Hebrew University"}, "7004429645": {"Name": "Oren Y.S.", "AuthorID": "7004429645", "AffiliationID": "60007903", "AffiliationName": "SpliSenseTherapeutics, Givat Ram Campus, Hebrew University"}, "57213270056": {"Name": "Walker A.J.", "AuthorID": "57213270056", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57203103916": {"Name": "Hart S.L.", "AuthorID": "57203103916", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}}}
