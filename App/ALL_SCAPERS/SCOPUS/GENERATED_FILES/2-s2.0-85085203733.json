The individuals described are three affected first-degree relatives (father, daughter and son), one affected niece and unaffected nephew and niece. Those affected all share a very similar phenotype consisting of asymmetric HCM, with hypertrophy particularly affecting the septum and the anterior wall, and similar electrocardiographic features, including a short PR interval. Case 1 (proband) presented with obstructive HCM and had undergone myectomy and mitral valve replacement. Case 2 (oldest offspring of Case 1) had non-obstructive HCM with exertional angina and NYHA II heart failure (HF) symptoms; she developed non-sustained ventricular tachycardia during follow-up and received a single-chamber ICD for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death. Case 3 (son of case 1) presented with asymptomatic non-obstructive HCM and developed NYHA II HF symptoms during follow-up. Case 4 had non-obstructive HCM, mainly with NYHA II HF symptoms. Testing of the proband for sarcomeric mutations and phenocopies was initially negative. After eight years of clinical follow-up, the suspicion of an undiscovered pathogenic gene mutation shared among the members of this family led us to enroll the proband in a whole-genome sequencing research project, which revealed a heterozygous pathogenic intronic MYBPC3 variant (c.1227-13G>A [rs397515893]), cosegregating with the phenotype.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Genetic testing", "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy", "Intronic variant", "MYBPC3", "Whole-genome sequencing"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085203733", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57212428143": {"Name": "Gomes A.C.", "AuthorID": "57212428143", "AffiliationID": "60025571", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, Garcia de Orta Hospital"}, "55354609100": {"Name": "Cruz I.", "AuthorID": "55354609100", "AffiliationID": "60025571", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, Garcia de Orta Hospital"}, "57216898341": {"Name": "Barbosa P.S.", "AuthorID": "57216898341", "AffiliationID": "60021283, 60106051", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"}, "55971705800": {"Name": "Carmo-Fonseca M.", "AuthorID": "55971705800", "AffiliationID": "60021283, 60106051", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"}, "57220538030": {"Name": "Coutinho A.", "AuthorID": "57220538030", "AffiliationID": "60106051", "AffiliationName": "Genomed, Diagn\u00f3stico de Medicina Molecular SA - Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"}, "9846194600": {"Name": "Lopes L.R.", "AuthorID": "9846194600", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}}}
