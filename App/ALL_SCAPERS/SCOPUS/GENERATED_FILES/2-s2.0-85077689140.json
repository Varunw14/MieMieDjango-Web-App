Most cases of KID syndrome (86%) are caused by a heterozygous missense mutation (c.148G>A, p.D50N) in the GJB2 gene, encoding gap junction protein Cx26, which alters gating properties of Cx26 channels in a dominant manner. We hypothesized that a mutant allele-specific small interfering RNA could rescue the cellular phenotype in patient keratinocytes (KCs). A KID syndrome cell line (KID-KC) was established from primary patient KCs with a heterozygous p.D50N mutation. This cell line displayed impaired gap junction communication and hyperactive hemichannels, confirmed by dye transfer, patch clamp, and neurobiotin uptake assays. A human-murine chimeric skin graft model constructed with KID-KCs mimicked patient skin in vivo, further confirming the validity of these cells as a model. In vitro treatment with allele-specific small interfering RNA led to robust inhibition of the mutant GJB2 allele without altering expression of the wild-type allele. This corrected both gap junction and hemichannel activity. Notably, allele-specific small interfering RNA treatment caused only low-level off-target effects in KID-KCs, as detected by genome-wide RNA sequencing. Our data provide an important proof-of-concept and model system for the potential use of allele-specific small interfering RNA in treating KID syndrome and other dominant genetic conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alleles", "Animals", "Cell Line", "Chimera", "Connexins", "Gap Junctions", "Heterografts", "Heterozygote", "Humans", "Keratinocytes", "Keratitis", "Membrane Potentials", "Mice", "Mutation, Missense", "RNA, Small Interfering", "Skin", "Skin Transplantation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077689140", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57213193712": {"Name": "Lee M.Y.", "AuthorID": "57213193712", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Infection, Immunity and Inflammation Programme/Immunobiology Section, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57213194783": {"Name": "Halai H.", "AuthorID": "57213194783", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Infection, Immunity and Inflammation Programme/Immunobiology Section, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57205772954": {"Name": "Petrova A.", "AuthorID": "57205772954", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Infection, Immunity and Inflammation Programme/Immunobiology Section, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57213199416": {"Name": "Xu D.", "AuthorID": "57213199416", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Infection, Immunity and Inflammation Programme/Immunobiology Section, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7003719640": {"Name": "Di W.L.", "AuthorID": "7003719640", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Infection, Immunity and Inflammation Programme/Immunobiology Section, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7501747100": {"Name": "Wang H.Z.", "AuthorID": "7501747100", "AffiliationID": "60026415", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Stony Brook University"}, "35499703300": {"Name": "White T.W.", "AuthorID": "35499703300", "AffiliationID": "60026415", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Stony Brook University"}, "57211635494": {"Name": "Brooks T.", "AuthorID": "57211635494", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Genomics, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57196045273": {"Name": "Pittman A.", "AuthorID": "57196045273", "AffiliationID": "60010426, 60029329", "AffiliationName": "Genetics Research Centre, St George's, University of London"}, "57203103916": {"Name": "Hart S.L.", "AuthorID": "57203103916", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "6506836269": {"Name": "Kinsler V.A.", "AuthorID": "6506836269", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Dermatology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}}}
