Three types of steel, namely mild steel (Grade A) and high tensile steel (Grades A and D) are tested under various corrosive conditions in the fresh water, in the sea water and in the air at a temperature of 18\u00b0C, 0\u00b0C and \u221210\u00b0C. Mass loss of test specimen due to corrosion is measured at a monthly interval and it is converted to a loss of steel plate thickness. Based on the test database, the effects of parameters affecting the corrosion progress are discussed. Test database obtained in the present study is documented.", "AuthorKeywords": ["corrosion rate", "low temperature", "marine corrosion", "marine structural steel", "Water immersion corrosion testing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Corrosion progress", "Corrosion testing", "Corrosive conditions", "High-tensile steels", "Low temperatures", "Marine corrosion", "Structural steels", "Test specimens"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073947867", "SubjectAreas": [["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"57190751412": {"Name": "Rajput A.", "AuthorID": "57190751412", "AffiliationID": "60104350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Indore"}, "57211443878": {"Name": "Kee Paik J.", "AuthorID": "57211443878", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "57205407902": {"Name": "Park J.H.", "AuthorID": "57205407902", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "Department of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Pusan National University"}, "57211445171": {"Name": "Hwan Noh S.", "AuthorID": "57211445171", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "Department of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Pusan National University"}}}
