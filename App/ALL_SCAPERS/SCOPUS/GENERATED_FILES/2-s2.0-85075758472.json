These data suggest revisions to previous chronological understandings of the site. New excavations, initiated in 2017, show a longer, more continuous occupation of the site than has been previously recognised. Archaeozoological and archaeobotanical analyses provide evidence for domesticated taxa. Archaeobotanical evidence is dominated by domesticated sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), radiocarbon dated to c. 2550\u20132210 BC. Faunal remains include cattle and goat/sheep. A late third-millennium BC date on the human skeleton excavated in the 2017 season also shows that mortuary activity began early in the site\u2019s history, contemporary with domesticated faunal and botanical remains. These initial results indicate the long-term association of the site with pastoralism and agriculture and with environmental change. Jebel Moya\u2019s continued potential to serve as a chronological and cultural reference point for future studies in south-central Sudan and the eastern Sahel is reinforced.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Agro-Pastoralism", "Cemeteries", "Jebel Moya", "Sorghum", "Sudan"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075758472", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"55916337600": {"Name": "Brass M.", "AuthorID": "55916337600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "57208724215": {"Name": "Fuller D.Q.", "AuthorID": "57208724215", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "7201560121": {"Name": "MacDonald K.", "AuthorID": "7201560121", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "26034718600": {"Name": "Stevens C.", "AuthorID": "26034718600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "57204214969": {"Name": "Adam A.", "AuthorID": "57204214969", "AffiliationID": "60071723", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology, University of Khartoum"}, "57204465036": {"Name": "Abdallah R.", "AuthorID": "57204465036", "AffiliationID": "60071723", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology, University of Khartoum"}, "57204465166": {"Name": "Alawad O.", "AuthorID": "57204465166", "AffiliationID": "60071723", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology, University of Khartoum"}, "57204467242": {"Name": "Abdalla A.", "AuthorID": "57204467242", "AffiliationID": "60071723", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology, University of Khartoum"}, "53984280600": {"Name": "Kozieradzka-Ogunmakin I.", "AuthorID": "53984280600", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester"}, "39963249900": {"Name": "Gregory I.V.", "AuthorID": "39963249900", "AffiliationID": "123524209", "AffiliationName": "Isabelle Vella Gregory: MacDonald Institute for Archaeological Research"}, "57204217332": {"Name": "Wellings J.", "AuthorID": "57204217332", "AffiliationID": "108062051", "AffiliationName": "Independent researcher"}, "57212022683": {"Name": "Hassan F.", "AuthorID": "57212022683", "AffiliationID": "108445299", "AffiliationName": "National Museum of Antiquities and Museums"}, "57204473983": {"Name": "Abdelrahman A.", "AuthorID": "57204473983", "AffiliationID": "108445299", "AffiliationName": "National Museum of Antiquities and Museums"}}}
