Objective: This study investigates the association between subclinical cardiac dysfunction, measured by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD and neurodegeneration. Methods: Vanderbilt Memory Aging Project participants free of dementia, stroke, and heart failure (n = 152, 72\u00b16 years, 68% male) underwent echocardiogram to quantify LVEF and lumbar puncture to measure CSF levels of amyloid-\u03b242 (A\u03b242), phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and total tau (t-tau). Linear regressions related LVEF to CSF biomarkers, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, Framingham Stroke Risk Profile, cognitive diagnosis, and apolipoprotein E \u03f54 status. Secondary models tested an LVEF x cognitive diagnosis interaction and then stratified by diagnosis (normal cognition (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI)). Results: Higher LVEF related to decreased CSF A\u03b242 levels (\u03b2=-6.50, p = 0.04) reflecting greater cerebral amyloid accumulation, but this counterintuitive result was attenuated after excluding participants with cardiovascular disease and atrial fibrillation (p = 0.07). We observed an interaction between LVEF and cognitive diagnosis on CSF t-tau (p = 0.004) and p-tau levels (p = 0.002), whereas lower LVEF was associated with increased CSF t-tau (\u03b2=-9.74, p = 0.01) and p-tau in the NC (\u03b2=-1.41, p = 0.003) but not MCI participants (p-values>0.13). Conclusions: Among cognitively normal older adults, subclinically lower LVEF relates to greater molecular evidence of tau phosphorylation and neurodegeneration. Modest age-related changes in cardiovascular function may have implications for pathophysiological changes in the brain later in life.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aging", "Alzheimer's disease", "atrophy", "cerebrospinal fluid proteins", "echocardiography", "tau proteins"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083328734", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57200679444": {"Name": "Kresge H.A.", "AuthorID": "57200679444", "AffiliationID": "60030769", "AffiliationName": "Vanderbilt Memory Alzheimer's Center, Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "57201549542": {"Name": "Moore E.E.", "AuthorID": "57201549542", "AffiliationID": "60030769", "AffiliationName": "Vanderbilt Memory Alzheimer's Center, Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "56785622300": {"Name": "Osborn K.E.", "AuthorID": "56785622300", "AffiliationID": "60030769", "AffiliationName": "Vanderbilt Memory Alzheimer's Center, Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "55641546300": {"Name": "Acosta L.M.Y.", "AuthorID": "55641546300", "AffiliationID": "60030769", "AffiliationName": "Vanderbilt Memory Alzheimer's Center, Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "55963292300": {"Name": "Bell S.P.", "AuthorID": "55963292300", "AffiliationID": "60030769", "AffiliationName": "Center for Quality Aging, Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "57202306584": {"Name": "Pechman K.R.", "AuthorID": "57202306584", "AffiliationID": "60030769", "AffiliationName": "Vanderbilt Memory Alzheimer's Center, Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "55956988700": {"Name": "Gifford K.A.", "AuthorID": "55956988700", "AffiliationID": "60030769", "AffiliationName": "Vanderbilt Memory Alzheimer's Center, Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "57211697123": {"Name": "Hohman T.J.", "AuthorID": "57211697123", "AffiliationID": "60030769", "AffiliationName": "Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "8228195700": {"Name": "Jefferson A.L.", "AuthorID": "8228195700", "AffiliationID": "60030769", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "55730508500": {"Name": "Liu D.", "AuthorID": "55730508500", "AffiliationID": "60030769", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "57217648463": {"Name": "Gupta D.K.", "AuthorID": "57217648463", "AffiliationID": "60030769", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "7006027252": {"Name": "Mendes L.A.", "AuthorID": "7006027252", "AffiliationID": "60030769", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "7405565318": {"Name": "Wang T.J.", "AuthorID": "7405565318", "AffiliationID": "60030769", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "7101909602": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "7101909602", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "57208899083": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "57208899083", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL"}}}
