Methods We performed a genetic evaluation of MAPT mutations in 826 neurologically healthy controls and 173 cases with CBS using the Illumina NeuroChip genotyping array. Results We identified 2 patients with CBS heterozygous for a rare mutation in MAPT (p.V363I) that is located in the highly conserved microtubule-binding domain. One patient was pathologically confirmed and demonstrated extensive 4-repeat-tau-positive thread pathology, achromatic neurons, and astrocytic plaques consistent with corticobasal degeneration (CBD). Conclusions We report 2 CBS cases carrying the rare p.V363I MAPT mutation, one of which was pathologically confirmed as CBD. Our findings support the notion that this rare coding change is pathogenic.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073784970", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"57204598191": {"Name": "Ahmed S.", "AuthorID": "57204598191", "AffiliationID": "60013780, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Neurodegenerative Disease Research Unit, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health"}, "57209063675": {"Name": "Sabir M.S.", "AuthorID": "57209063675", "AffiliationID": "60013780, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Neurodegenerative Disease Research Unit, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health"}, "12240193500": {"Name": "Scholz S.W.", "AuthorID": "12240193500", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins University Medical Center"}, "57195546809": {"Name": "Fairen M.D.", "AuthorID": "57195546809", "AffiliationID": "60015366", "AffiliationName": "Movement Disorders and Memory Unit, Department of Neurology, University Hospital Mutua de Terrassa, Fundaci\u00f3 per la Recerca Biom\u00e8dica i Social M\u00fatua Terrassa"}, "57193218596": {"Name": "Pastor P.", "AuthorID": "57193218596", "AffiliationID": "60015366", "AffiliationName": "Movement Disorders and Memory Unit, Department of Neurology, University Hospital Mutua de Terrassa, Fundaci\u00f3 per la Recerca Biom\u00e8dica i Social M\u00fatua Terrassa"}, "23472611900": {"Name": "Ding J.", "AuthorID": "23472611900", "AffiliationID": "60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institutes on Aging, National Institutes of Health"}, "24484630700": {"Name": "Ispierto L.", "AuthorID": "24484630700", "AffiliationID": "60028462", "AffiliationName": "Neurology Service, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias"}, "57193263286": {"Name": "Butala A.", "AuthorID": "57193263286", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins University Medical Center"}, "16199947000": {"Name": "Pantelyat A.", "AuthorID": "16199947000", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins University Medical Center"}, "7401472221": {"Name": "Morris C.M.", "AuthorID": "7401472221", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Newcastle Institute for Ageing, Campus for Ageing and Vitality, Newcastle University"}, "57207902594": {"Name": "Schulte C.", "AuthorID": "57207902594", "AffiliationID": "60084331, 60017246, 60103674", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Diseases, Center of Neurology, Hertie-Institute for Clinical Brain Research, University of Tuebingen, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases"}, "57212932702": {"Name": "Gasser T.", "AuthorID": "57212932702", "AffiliationID": "60084331, 60017246, 60103674", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Diseases, Center of Neurology, Hertie-Institute for Clinical Brain Research, University of Tuebingen, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases"}, "56494611500": {"Name": "Jabbari E.", "AuthorID": "56494611500", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Clinical Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7401534782": {"Name": "Morris H.R.", "AuthorID": "7401534782", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Royal Free Campus UCL, Institute of Neurology"}, "6508007276": {"Name": "Pletnikova O.", "AuthorID": "6508007276", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology (Neuropathology), Johns Hopkins University Medical Center"}, "7005194760": {"Name": "Troncoso J.", "AuthorID": "7005194760", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology (Neuropathology), Johns Hopkins University Medical Center"}, "34975066500": {"Name": "Gelpi E.", "AuthorID": "34975066500", "AffiliationID": "60018333, 60011394", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, Medical University of Vienna"}}}
