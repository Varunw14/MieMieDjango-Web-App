British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British Pharmacological SocietyMedication non-adherence, defined as any deviation from the regimen recommended by their healthcare provider, can increase morbidity, mortality and side effects, while reducing effectiveness. Through studying two respiratory conditions, asthma and tuberculosis (TB), we thoroughly review the current understanding of the measurement and reporting of medication adherence. In this paper, we identify major methodological issues in the standard ways that adherence has been conceptualised, defined and studied in asthma and TB. Between and within the two diseases there are substantial variations in adherence reporting, linked to differences in dosing intervals and treatment duration. Critically, the communicable nature of TB has resulted in dose-by-dose monitoring becoming a recommended treatment standard. Through the lens of these similarities and contrasts, we highlight contemporary shortcomings in the generalised conceptualisation of medication adherence. Furthermore, we outline elements in which knowledge could be directly transferred from one condition to the other, such as the application of large-scale cost-effective monitoring methods in TB to resource-poor settings in asthma. To develop a more robust evidence-based approach, we recommend the use of standard taxonomies detailed in the ABC taxonomy when measuring and discussing adherence. Regimen and intervention development and use should be based on sufficient evidence of the commonality and type of adherence behaviours displayed by patients with the relevant condition. A systematic approach to the measurement and reporting of adherence could improve the value and generalisability of research across all health conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adherence", "asthma", "compliance", "persistence", "tuberculosis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088598216", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57193828756": {"Name": "Tibble H.", "AuthorID": "57193828756", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272, 60111945", "AffiliationName": "Asthma UK Centre for Applied Research, Usher Institute, Centre for Medical Informatics, University of Edinburgh"}, "57218277464": {"Name": "Flook M.", "AuthorID": "57218277464", "AffiliationID": "60110825", "AffiliationName": "Usher Institute, Edinburgh Medical School, College of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}, "57209873322": {"Name": "Sheikh A.", "AuthorID": "57209873322", "AffiliationID": "121377269", "AffiliationName": "Health Data Research UK"}, "25930622500": {"Name": "Tsanas A.", "AuthorID": "25930622500", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272, 60111945", "AffiliationName": "Asthma UK Centre for Applied Research, Usher Institute, Centre for Medical Informatics, University of Edinburgh"}, "55201612700": {"Name": "Stagg H.R.", "AuthorID": "55201612700", "AffiliationID": "60110825", "AffiliationName": "Usher Institute, Edinburgh Medical School, College of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}, "23012144600": {"Name": "Horne R.", "AuthorID": "23012144600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016379", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Behavioural Medicine, Department for Practice and Policy, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "6602081889": {"Name": "Vrijens B.", "AuthorID": "6602081889", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "Li\u00e8ge University"}, "7004627344": {"Name": "De Geest S.", "AuthorID": "7004627344", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Academic Centre for Nursing and Midwifery, KU Leuven"}}}
