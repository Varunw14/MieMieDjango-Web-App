This has consequential environmental issues due to the high toxicity and hazard of the reactants. In the present work, an environmentally benign fluorination approach is demonstrated that uses only a trace amount of sodium fluoride with an RF of 10-6 during synthesis. While it maintained the desirable high surface area (102.4 m2/g), the trace-level fluorination enabled significant enhancements on photocatalytic activities (e.g., a 56% increase on hydrogen evolution rate) and heavy metal Pb(II) removal (31%) of the mesoporous TiO2. This can be attributed to enriched Ti3+ and localized spatial charge separation due to fluorination as proved by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR), and density functional theory (DFT) analyses.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Charge separations", "Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy", "Environmental issues", "Environmentally benign", "High surface area", "Hydrogen evolution rate", "Mesoporous TiO2", "TiO2 nanocrystallites"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096618605", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"57220024884": {"Name": "Xu Y.", "AuthorID": "57220024884", "AffiliationID": "60018554", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Zhengzhou University"}, "57218376485": {"Name": "Cui L.", "AuthorID": "57218376485", "AffiliationID": "60018554", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Zhengzhou University"}, "35101844500": {"Name": "Fan J.", "AuthorID": "35101844500", "AffiliationID": "60018554", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Zhengzhou University"}, "55156398200": {"Name": "Zhang X.L.", "AuthorID": "55156398200", "AffiliationID": "60018554", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Zhengzhou University"}, "57220044240": {"Name": "Tay T.F.", "AuthorID": "57220044240", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Engineering, University of New South Wales"}, "56708106500": {"Name": "Niu C.", "AuthorID": "56708106500", "AffiliationID": "60018554", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Microelectronics, Zhengzhou University"}, "7405454282": {"Name": "Chen D.", "AuthorID": "7405454282", "AffiliationID": "60011362", "AffiliationName": "Applied Chemistry and Environmental Science, School of Science, RMIT University"}, "7102906940": {"Name": "Caruso R.A.", "AuthorID": "7102906940", "AffiliationID": "60011362", "AffiliationName": "Applied Chemistry and Environmental Science, School of Science, RMIT University"}, "57198560184": {"Name": "Guo Z.X.", "AuthorID": "57198560184", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Hong Kong"}, "57218390121": {"Name": "Sun C.", "AuthorID": "57218390121", "AffiliationID": "60030804", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Biotechnology, Swinburne University of Technology"}}}
