It describes the formation of domains and the spontaneous nucleation of topological defects when a system is driven across a phase transition exhibiting spontaneous symmetry breaking. While a characteristic dependence of the defect density on the speed at which the transition is crossed was observed in a vast range of equilibrium condensed matter systems, its extension to intrinsically driven dissipative systems is a matter of ongoing research. In this Letter, we numerically confirm the Kibble-Zurek mechanism in a paradigmatic family of driven dissipative quantum systems, namely exciton-polaritons in microcavities. Our findings show how the concepts of universality and critical dynamics extend to driven dissipative systems that do not conserve energy or particle number nor satisfy a detailed balance condition.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Condensed matter system", "Dissipative quantum systems", "Dissipative systems", "Exciton polaritons", "Kibble-Zurek mechanism", "Nonequilibrium phase transitions", "Spontaneous nucleation", "Spontaneous symmetry breaking"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090897502", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57206143651": {"Name": "Zamora A.", "AuthorID": "57206143651", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57015614300": {"Name": "Dagvadorj G.", "AuthorID": "57015614300", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}, "7004604921": {"Name": "Szyma\u0144ska M.H.", "AuthorID": "7004604921", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "55868272900": {"Name": "Comaron P.", "AuthorID": "55868272900", "AffiliationID": "60012519", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "6603762366": {"Name": "Proukakis N.P.", "AuthorID": "6603762366", "AffiliationID": "60006222, 60176039", "AffiliationName": "Joint Quantum Centre (JQC) Durham-Newcastle, School of Mathematics, Statistics and Physics, Newcastle University"}, "7003588359": {"Name": "Carusotto I.", "AuthorID": "7003588359", "AffiliationID": "60015986, 60006264", "AffiliationName": "INO-CNR BEC Center, Universit\u00e0 di Trento"}}}
