However, these existing atlases are limited to small numbers of manually annotated samples from a single cerebral hemisphere, measured from 2D histological sections. We present the first whole-brain quantitative 3D laminar atlas of the human cerebral cortex. It was derived from a 3D histological atlas of the human brain at 20-micrometer isotropic resolution (BigBrain), using a convolutional neural network to segment, automatically, the cortical layers in both hemispheres. Our approach overcomes many of the historical challenges with measurement of histological thickness in 2D, and the resultant laminar atlas provides an unprecedented level of precision and detail. We utilized this BigBrain cortical atlas to test whether previously reported thickness gradients, as measured by MRI in sensory and motor processing cortices, were present in a histological atlas of cortical thickness and which cortical layers were contributing to these gradients. Cortical thickness increased across sensory processing hierarchies, primarily driven by layers III, V, and VI. In contrast, motor-frontal cortices showed the opposite pattern, with decreases in total and pyramidal layer thickness from motor to frontal association cortices. These findings illustrate how this laminar atlas will provide a link between single-neuron morphology, mesoscale cortical layering, macroscopic cortical thickness, and, ultimately, functional neuroanatomy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Brain", "Cerebral Cortex", "Humans", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Neural Networks, Computer"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083544327", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"56538706700": {"Name": "Wagstyl K.", "AuthorID": "56538706700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "7003408844": {"Name": "Lepage C.", "AuthorID": "7003408844", "AffiliationID": "60030616, 60002494", "AffiliationName": "McGill Centre for Integrative Neuroscience, Montr\u00e9al Neurological Institute"}, "14047100300": {"Name": "Lewis L.B.", "AuthorID": "14047100300", "AffiliationID": "60030616, 60002494", "AffiliationName": "McGill Centre for Integrative Neuroscience, Montr\u00e9al Neurological Institute"}, "57060089700": {"Name": "Funck T.", "AuthorID": "57060089700", "AffiliationID": "60030616, 60002494", "AffiliationName": "McGill Centre for Integrative Neuroscience, Montr\u00e9al Neurological Institute"}, "57198743053": {"Name": "Evans A.C.", "AuthorID": "57198743053", "AffiliationID": "60030616, 60002494", "AffiliationName": "McGill Centre for Integrative Neuroscience, Montr\u00e9al Neurological Institute"}, "7202904117": {"Name": "Fletcher P.C.", "AuthorID": "7202904117", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge"}, "57203313005": {"Name": "Larocque S.", "AuthorID": "57203313005", "AffiliationID": "60113142, 60009507", "AffiliationName": "MILA, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"}, "57193324564": {"Name": "Cucurull G.", "AuthorID": "57193324564", "AffiliationID": "60113142, 60009507", "AffiliationName": "MILA, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"}, "55475172900": {"Name": "Cohen J.P.", "AuthorID": "55475172900", "AffiliationID": "60113142, 60009507", "AffiliationName": "MILA, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"}, "55437167800": {"Name": "Romero A.", "AuthorID": "55437167800", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, McGill University"}, "7003958245": {"Name": "Bengio Y.", "AuthorID": "7003958245", "AffiliationID": "60113142, 60009507", "AffiliationName": "MILA, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"}, "41261005900": {"Name": "Bludau S.", "AuthorID": "41261005900", "AffiliationID": "60007774", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-1), Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich GmbH"}, "6602591225": {"Name": "Palomero-Gallagher N.", "AuthorID": "6602591225", "AffiliationID": "60120200, 60016653", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University"}, "57188643453": {"Name": "Spitzer H.", "AuthorID": "57188643453", "AffiliationID": "60007774", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-1), Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich GmbH"}, "35208264000": {"Name": "Dickscheid T.", "AuthorID": "35208264000", "AffiliationID": "60007774", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-1), Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich GmbH"}, "55871516700": {"Name": "Zilles K.", "AuthorID": "55871516700", "AffiliationID": "60007774", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-1), Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich GmbH"}, "6701836721": {"Name": "Amunts K.", "AuthorID": "6701836721", "AffiliationID": "60072305, 60025310", "AffiliationName": "Cecile und Oskar Vogt Institute for Brain Research, Heinrich Heine University Duesseldorf, University Hospital Duesseldorf"}}}
