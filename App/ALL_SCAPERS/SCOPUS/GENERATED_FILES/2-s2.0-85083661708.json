Axial SpA (axSpA) affects the axial skeleton with either radiographic (r-axSpA) or nonradiographic (nr-axSpA) changes. Radiographic changes are a late disease feature and earlier disease stages can be identified by incorporating other imaging methods. The diagnosis of axSpA is a clinical diagnosis and classification criteria are not aimed to be diagnostic tools. The split between r-axSpA and nr-axSpA is artificial and we should move toward the unifying concept of axSpA. Our understanding of genetics, biomarkers, and immunopathophenotypes will drive further refinement of classification criteria.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ankylosing spondylitis", "Axial spondyloarthritis", "Back pain", "Classification", "Diagnosis", "Inflammation", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Radiographs"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083661708", "SubjectAreas": [["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"]], "AuthorData": {"57216485644": {"Name": "Hayward R.J.", "AuthorID": "57216485644", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35243075300": {"Name": "Machado P.M.", "AuthorID": "35243075300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology, University College London"}}}
