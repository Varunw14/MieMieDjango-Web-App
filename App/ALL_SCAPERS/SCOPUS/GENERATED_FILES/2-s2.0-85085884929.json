At present, field populations remain susceptible to spinosad. However, the resistant strain JW-100s has been obtained under laboratory selection with spinosad, and resistance has been associated with the presence of different mutations causing truncated transcripts of the \u03b16 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR\u03b16). RESULTS: An F1 screen assay followed by the molecular characterization of surviving flies has been used to search for spinosad-resistant alleles in field populations. Two different resistant alleles giving rise to truncated isoforms of Cc\u03b16 have been identified, which corresponds to an estimated allelic frequency of at least 0.0023\u20130.0046. The fitness values of the resistant nAChR\u03b16 alleles found in the laboratory strain JW-100s were estimated to be 0.4 for RR and 0.2 for SR. Mathematical modelling predicted that spinosad-resistant alleles will rapidly decline over time in field populations if their fitness cost was the same as estimated for laboratory-resistant alleles. However, they are predicted to increase in the field if their fitness cost is lower and resistance management strategies are not implemented. CONCLUSION: Spinosad-resistant alleles have been detected in field populations for the first time. Our modelling simulations indicate that the best option to delay the appearance of spinosad resistance would be its rotation with other insecticides without cross-resistance. The integrated F1 screen/molecular genetic analysis presented here can be used for future monitoring studies. \u00a9 2020 The Authors.
