In Europe, this is of particular relevance with ageing populations living with non-communicable diseases, multi-morbidity and frailty. Published estimates of Years Lived with Disability (YLD) from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study help to characterise the extent of these effects. Our aim was to identify the countries across Europe that have populations at highest risk from COVID-19 by using estimates of population age structure and YLD for health conditions linked to severe illness from COVID-19. Methods: Population and YLD estimates from GBD 2017 were extracted for 45 countries in Europe. YLD was restricted to a list of specific health conditions associated with being at risk of developing severe consequences from COVID-19 based on guidance from the United Kingdom Government. This guidance also identified individuals aged 70 years and above as being at higher risk of developing severe health consequences. Study outcomes were defined as: (i) proportion of population aged 70 years and above; and (ii) rate of YLD for COVID-19 vulnerable health conditions across all ages. Bivariate groupings were established for each outcome and combined to establish overall population-level vulnerability. Results: Countries with the highest proportions of elderly residents were Italy, Greece, Germany, Portugal and Finland. When assessments of population-level YLD rates for COVID-19 vulnerable health conditions were made, the highest rates were observed for Bulgaria, Czechia, Croatia, Hungary and Bosnia and Herzegovina. A bivariate analysis indicated that the countries at high-risk across both measures of vulnerability were: Bulgaria; Portugal; Latvia; Lithuania; Greece; Germany; Estonia; and Sweden. Conclusion: Routine estimates of population structures and non-fatal burden of disease measures can be usefully combined to create composite indicators of vulnerability for rapid assessments, in this case to severe health consequences from COVID-19. Countries with available results for sub-national regions within their country, or national burden of disease studies that also use sub-national levels for burden quantifications, should consider using non-fatal burden of disease estimates to estimate geographical vulnerability to COVID-19.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Burden of disease", "Coronavirus", "COVID-19", "DALY", "European burden of disease network", "GBD", "Summary measures of population health", "Vulnerability", "YLD"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085619770", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"56503829800": {"Name": "Wyper G.M.A.", "AuthorID": "56503829800", "AffiliationID": "60162135", "AffiliationName": "Place and Wellbeing Directorate, Public Health Scotland"}, "7004670738": {"Name": "Stockton D.L.", "AuthorID": "7004670738", "AffiliationID": "60162135", "AffiliationName": "Place and Wellbeing Directorate, Public Health Scotland"}, "56330129500": {"Name": "Assun\u00e7\u00e3o R.", "AuthorID": "56330129500", "AffiliationID": "60009230", "AffiliationName": "Food and Nutrition Department, National Institute of Health Dr. Ricardo Jorge"}, "55912623000": {"Name": "Cuschieri S.", "AuthorID": "55912623000", "AffiliationID": "60072655, 60072651", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine and Surgery, University of Malta"}, "57216977310": {"Name": "Devleeschauwer B.", "AuthorID": "57216977310", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Veterinary Public Health and Food Safety, Ghent University"}, "56763579800": {"Name": "Fletcher E.", "AuthorID": "56763579800", "AffiliationID": "60162135", "AffiliationName": "Data Driven Innovation Directorate, Public Health Scotland"}, "57202676108": {"Name": "Grant I.", "AuthorID": "57202676108", "AffiliationID": "60162135", "AffiliationName": "Data Driven Innovation Directorate, Public Health Scotland"}, "57202571125": {"Name": "Haagsma J.A.", "AuthorID": "57202571125", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, Erasmus MC University Medical Center"}, "6508145250": {"Name": "Hilderink H.B.M.", "AuthorID": "6508145250", "AffiliationID": "60026125", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM)"}, "55962569100": {"Name": "Idavain J.", "AuthorID": "55962569100", "AffiliationID": "60068883", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Development"}, "57216981388": {"Name": "Lesnik T.", "AuthorID": "57216981388", "AffiliationID": "60014547", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Public Health"}, "55756303500": {"Name": "Von Der Lippe E.", "AuthorID": "55756303500", "AffiliationID": "60016183", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Health Monitoring, Robert Koch Institute"}, "15019273100": {"Name": "Majdan M.", "AuthorID": "15019273100", "AffiliationID": "60032282", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, Institute for Global Health and Epidemiology, Faculty of Health Sciences and Social Work, Trnava University"}, "57209748201": {"Name": "Milicevic M.S.", "AuthorID": "57209748201", "AffiliationID": "60068815, 60068827", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine University of Belgrade"}, "57188667049": {"Name": "Pallari E.", "AuthorID": "57188667049", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials and Methodology Unit, University College London"}, "8075905700": {"Name": "Pe\u00f1alvo J.L.", "AuthorID": "8075905700", "AffiliationID": "60028863", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Noncommunicable Diseases, Department of Public Health, Institute of Tropical Medicine"}, "26031106700": {"Name": "Pires S.M.", "AuthorID": "26031106700", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "National Food Institute, Technical University of Denmark"}, "57202814451": {"Name": "Thomsen S.T.", "AuthorID": "57202814451", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "National Food Institute, Technical University of Denmark"}, "57217142114": {"Name": "Pla\u00df D.", "AuthorID": "57217142114", "AffiliationID": "116272123", "AffiliationName": "Exposure Assessment and Environmental Health Indicators, German Environment Agency"}, "55851941419": {"Name": "Santos J.V.", "AuthorID": "55851941419", "AffiliationID": "108335371", "AffiliationName": "Public Health Unit, ACES Grande Porto VIII - Espinho/Gaia, ARS Norte"}}}
