The brain lactate shuttle hypothesis proposes that lactate, provided by astrocytes, is an important neuronal energy substrate. Here we tested the hypothesis that anaesthetic agents impair the brain lactate shuttle by interfering with astrocytic glycolysis. Lactate biosensors were used to record changes in lactate release by adult rat brainstem and cortical slices in response to thiopental, propofol and etomidate. Changes in cytosolic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reduced (NADH) and oxidized (NAD+) ratio as a measure of glycolytic rate were recorded in cultured astrocytes. It was found that in brainstem slices thiopental, propofol and etomidate reduced lactate release by 7.4 \u00b1 3.6% (P < 0.001), 9.7 \u00b1 6.6% (P < 0.001) and 8.0 \u00b1 7.8% (P = 0.04), respectively. In cortical slices, thiopental reduced lactate release by 8.2 \u00b1 5.6% (P = 0.002) and propofol by 6.0 \u00b1 4.5% (P = 0.009). Lactate release in cortical slices measured during the light phase (period of sleep/low activity) was ~25% lower than that measured during the dark phase (period of wakefulness) (326 \u00b1 83 \u03bcM vs 430 \u00b1 118 \u03bcM, n = 10; P = 0.04). Thiopental and etomidate induced proportionally similar decreases in cytosolic [NADH]:[NAD+] ratio in astrocytes, indicative of a reduction in glycolytic rate. These data suggest that anaesthetic agents inhibit astrocytic glycolysis and reduce the level of extracellular lactate in the brain. Similar reductions in brain lactate release occur during natural state of sleep, suggesting that general anaesthesia may recapitulate some of the effects of sleep on brain energy metabolism.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anaesthesia", "Brain energy metabolism", "GABAergic mechanisms", "Lactate", "Lactate shuttle", "Sleep"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085293419", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"56287207100": {"Name": "Hadjihambi A.", "AuthorID": "56287207100", "AffiliationID": "60000239", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Lausanne"}, "26429741300": {"Name": "Karagiannis A.", "AuthorID": "26429741300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular and Metabolic Neuroscience, Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "56011079900": {"Name": "Theparambil S.M.", "AuthorID": "56011079900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular and Metabolic Neuroscience, Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "57204343249": {"Name": "Gourine A.V.", "AuthorID": "57204343249", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular and Metabolic Neuroscience, Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "8768192800": {"Name": "Ackland G.L.", "AuthorID": "8768192800", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Translational Medicine & Therapeutics, William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
