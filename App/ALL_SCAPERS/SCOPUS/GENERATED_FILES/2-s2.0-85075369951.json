Neuroligin-2 plays a critical role in the stabilization of synaptic GABAA receptors and the development and maintenance of inhibitory synapses. To date, little is known about how the amount of neuroligin-2 at the synapse is regulated and whether neuroligin-2 trafficking affects inhibitory signaling. Here, we show that neuroligin-2, when internalized to endosomes, co-localizes with SNX27, a brain-enriched cargo-adaptor protein that facilitates membrane protein recycling. Direct interaction between the PDZ domain of SNX27 and PDZ-binding motif in neuroligin-2 enables membrane retrieval of neuroligin-2, thus enhancing synaptic neuroligin-2 clusters. Furthermore, SNX27 knockdown has the opposite effect. SNX27-mediated up- and downregulation of neuroligin-2 surface levels affects inhibitory synapse composition and signaling strength. Taken together, we show a role for SNX27-mediated recycling of neuroligin-2 in maintenance and signaling of the GABAergic synapse.\u00a9 2019 The AuthorsTo maintain healthy brain function, neurons tightly regulate the balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic signaling. Neuroligin-2 is a postsynaptic adhesion protein important for inhibitory synapse function. In this article, Halff et al. describe how the protein SNX27 modulates synaptic levels of neuroligin-2, thereby regulating the strength of inhibitory signaling.", "AuthorKeywords": ["E/I balance", "endocytosis", "GABA", "inhibitory signaling", "neuroligin", "neuronal plasticity", "NLGN2", "retromer", "SNX27"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal", "Chlorocebus aethiops", "COS Cells", "Endosomes", "Female", "HeLa Cells", "Humans", "Male", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Signal Transduction", "Sorting Nexins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075369951", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"22953552500": {"Name": "Halff E.F.", "AuthorID": "22953552500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology, and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "56993373500": {"Name": "Szulc B.R.", "AuthorID": "56993373500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology, and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "52364313900": {"Name": "Lesept F.", "AuthorID": "52364313900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology, and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7102315993": {"Name": "Kittler J.T.", "AuthorID": "7102315993", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology, and Pharmacology, University College London"}}}
