In the 15th century Benedetti was able to write, \u00abBy means of nerves, the pathways of the senses are distributed like the roots and fibers of a tree\u00bb (Alessandro Benedetti, 1497). This is still a good place to start because it gives one a feel for the 3D structure of our sensory apparatus, but the challenge of understanding the senses has, of course, gone well beyond structure (which is not to imply that all structural descriptions are complete or that we have joined all the dots of structure-function relationships), and any serious scholar needs to have a working knowledge of the development, physiology, psychophysics (physiology without the blood), genetics, pathology, and computational models of the senses.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Auditory system", "Multisensory integration", "Nerves", "Somatosensation", "Visual system"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084711510", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57220439700": {"Name": "Walsh V.", "AuthorID": "57220439700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
