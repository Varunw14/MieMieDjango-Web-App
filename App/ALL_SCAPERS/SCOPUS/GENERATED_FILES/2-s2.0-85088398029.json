The causative disease mechanism is largely unknown, and no treatment is currently available. A previous study found variants in genes associated with glycine\u2013serine metabolism (PSPH, PHGDH and CPS1) to be associated with MacTel, and showed low levels of glycine and serine in the serum of MacTel patients. Recently, a causative role of deoxysphingolipids in MacTel disease has been established. However, little is known about possible other metabolic dysregulation. Here we used a global metabolomics platform in a case\u2013control study to comprehensively profile serum from 60 MacTel patients and 58 controls. Analysis of the data, using innovative computational approaches, revealed a detailed, disease-associated metabolic profile with broad changes in multiple metabolic pathways. This included alterations in the levels of several metabolites that are directly or indirectly linked to glycine\u2013serine metabolism, further validating our previous genetic findings. We also found changes unrelated to PSPH, PHGDH and CPS1 activity. Most pronounced, levels of several lipid groups were altered, with increased phosphatidylethanolamines being the most affected lipid group. Assessing correlations between different metabolites across our samples revealed putative functional connections. Correlations between phosphatidylethanolamines and sphingomyelin, and glycine\u2013serine and sphingomyelin, observed in controls, were reduced in MacTel patients, suggesting metabolic re-wiring of sphingomyelin metabolism in MacTel patients. Our findings provide novel insights into metabolic changes associated with MacTel and implicate altered lipid metabolism as a contributor to this retinal neurodegenerative disease.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Carbamoyl-Phosphate Synthase (Ammonia)", "Case-Control Studies", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Female", "Genetic Variation", "Glycine", "Humans", "Male", "Metabolic Networks and Pathways", "Metabolome", "Metabolomics", "Middle Aged", "Phosphatidylethanolamines", "Phosphoglycerate Dehydrogenase", "Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases", "Retinal Diseases", "Risk Factors", "Serine", "Sphingomyelins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088398029", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57193445843": {"Name": "Bonelli R.", "AuthorID": "57193445843", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne"}, "55819286600": {"Name": "Ansell B.R.E.", "AuthorID": "55819286600", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne"}, "55696911900": {"Name": "Bahlo M.", "AuthorID": "55696911900", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne"}, "57200938646": {"Name": "Woods S.M.", "AuthorID": "57200938646", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "55555386500": {"Name": "Heeren T.F.C.", "AuthorID": "55555386500", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57202026571": {"Name": "Fruttiger M.", "AuthorID": "57202026571", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "8101026700": {"Name": "Egan C.A.", "AuthorID": "8101026700", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36646250000": {"Name": "Khan K.N.", "AuthorID": "36646250000", "AffiliationID": "60020454, 60012508", "AffiliationName": "The Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, St. James\u2019s Hospital"}, "6603688370": {"Name": "Guymer R.", "AuthorID": "6603688370", "AffiliationID": "60019331, 60016598", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Center for Eye Research Australia, Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital, and Ophthalmology"}, "56966527600": {"Name": "Trombley J.", "AuthorID": "56966527600", "AffiliationID": "108231092", "AffiliationName": "Lowy Medical Research Institute"}, "7102298919": {"Name": "Friedlander M.", "AuthorID": "7102298919", "AffiliationID": "60007103", "AffiliationName": "The Scripps Research Institute"}}}
