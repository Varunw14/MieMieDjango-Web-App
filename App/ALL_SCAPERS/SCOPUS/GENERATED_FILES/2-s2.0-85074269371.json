The incidence of GBS can therefore increase during outbreaks of infectious diseases, as was seen during the Zika virus epidemics in 2013 in French Polynesia and 2015 in Latin America. Diagnosis and management of GBS can be complicated as its clinical presentation and disease course are heterogeneous, and no international clinical guidelines are currently available. To support clinicians, especially in the context of an outbreak, we have developed a globally applicable guideline for the diagnosis and management of GBS. The guideline is based on current literature and expert consensus, and has a ten-step structure to facilitate its use in clinical practice. We first provide an introduction to the diagnostic criteria, clinical variants and differential diagnoses of GBS. The ten steps then cover early recognition and diagnosis of GBS, admission to the intensive care unit, treatment indication and selection, monitoring and treatment of disease progression, prediction of clinical course and outcome, and management of complications and sequelae.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Disease Management", "Genetic Variation", "Guillain-Barre Syndrome", "Humans", "Zika Virus Infection"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074269371", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"57189003453": {"Name": "Leonhard S.E.", "AuthorID": "57189003453", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Erasmus University Medical Center"}, "55901435700": {"Name": "Mandarakas M.R.", "AuthorID": "55901435700", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Erasmus University Medical Center"}, "7006342425": {"Name": "van Doorn P.A.", "AuthorID": "7006342425", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Erasmus University Medical Center"}, "55825445500": {"Name": "Jacobs B.C.", "AuthorID": "55825445500", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology, Erasmus University Medical Center"}, "35581244500": {"Name": "Gondim F.A.A.", "AuthorID": "35581244500", "AffiliationID": "60020457", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Universit\u00e1rio Walter Cantidio, Universidade Federal do Cear\u00e1"}, "36949107200": {"Name": "Bateman K.", "AuthorID": "36949107200", "AffiliationID": "60003757, 60000356", "AffiliationName": "Groote Schuur Hospital, University of Cape Town"}, "7402787396": {"Name": "Ferreira M.L.B.", "AuthorID": "7402787396", "AffiliationID": "60069376", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Hospital da Restaura\u00e7\u00e3o"}, "7006050597": {"Name": "Cornblath D.R.", "AuthorID": "7006050597", "AffiliationID": "60001117", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"}, "7005551859": {"Name": "Pardo C.A.", "AuthorID": "7005551859", "AffiliationID": "60001117", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"}, "6701796974": {"Name": "Dourado M.E.", "AuthorID": "6701796974", "AffiliationID": "60023857", "AffiliationName": "Department of Integrative Medicine, Hospital Universit\u00e1rio Onofre Lopes, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte"}, "35433413400": {"Name": "Hughes R.A.C.", "AuthorID": "35433413400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57194464797": {"Name": "Islam B.", "AuthorID": "57194464797", "AffiliationID": "60010123", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh"}, "57201510972": {"Name": "Kusunoki S.", "AuthorID": "57201510972", "AffiliationID": "60031607", "AffiliationName": "Kindai University Faculty of Medicine"}, "55910859200": {"Name": "Reisin R.", "AuthorID": "55910859200", "AffiliationID": "60001904", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Brit\u00e1nico"}, "7003834515": {"Name": "Sejvar J.J.", "AuthorID": "7003834515", "AffiliationID": "60021658", "AffiliationName": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}, "57202527916": {"Name": "Shahrizaila N.", "AuthorID": "57202527916", "AffiliationID": "60029157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Malaya"}, "8694472600": {"Name": "Soares C.", "AuthorID": "8694472600", "AffiliationID": "100786451", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Federal dos Servidores do Estado"}, "6602092493": {"Name": "Umapathi T.", "AuthorID": "6602092493", "AffiliationID": "60025076", "AffiliationName": "National Neuroscience Institute"}, "54413121100": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "54413121100", "AffiliationID": "60032477", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Affiliated Hospital of Jining Medical University"}, "24448849500": {"Name": "Yiu E.M.", "AuthorID": "24448849500", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, The University of Melbourne"}, "7007083643": {"Name": "Willison H.J.", "AuthorID": "7007083643", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow"}}}
