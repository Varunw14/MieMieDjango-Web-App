STEM CELLS TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of AlphaMed PressSkeletal muscle decellularization allows the generation of natural scaffolds that retain the extracellular matrix (ECM) mechanical integrity, biological activity, and three-dimensional (3D) architecture of the native tissue. Recent reports showed that in vivo implantation of decellularized muscles supports muscle regeneration in volumetric muscle loss models, including nervous system and neuromuscular junctional homing. Since the nervous system plays pivotal roles during skeletal muscle regeneration and in tissue homeostasis, support of reinnervation is a crucial aspect to be considered. However, the effect of decellularized muscles on reinnervation and on neuronal axon growth has been poorly investigated. Here, we characterized residual protein composition of decellularized muscles by mass spectrometry and we show that scaffolds preserve structural proteins of the ECM of both skeletal muscle and peripheral nervous system. To investigate whether decellularized scaffolds could per se attract neural axons, organotypic sections of spinal cord were cultured three dimensionally in vitro, in presence or in absence of decellularized muscles. We found that neural axons extended from the spinal cord are attracted by the decellularized muscles and penetrate inside the scaffolds upon 3D coculture. These results demonstrate that decellularized scaffolds possess intrinsic neurotrophic properties, supporting their potential use for the treatment of clinical cases where extensive functional regeneration of the muscle is required.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D culture", "axons", "decellularized muscle", "ECM", "innervation", "neurons", "organotypic culture", "spinal cord"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087295568", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57172782000": {"Name": "Raffa P.", "AuthorID": "57172782000", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Women's and Children's Health Department, University of Padova"}, "56387603800": {"Name": "Scattolini V.", "AuthorID": "56387603800", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Women's and Children's Health Department, University of Padova"}, "6603752989": {"Name": "Elvassore N.", "AuthorID": "6603752989", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Industrial Engineering Department, University of Padova"}, "50261489800": {"Name": "Gerli M.F.M.", "AuthorID": "50261489800", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57192557664": {"Name": "Perin S.", "AuthorID": "57192557664", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57203257829": {"Name": "De Coppi P.", "AuthorID": "57203257829", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "6508342717": {"Name": "Urciuolo A.", "AuthorID": "6508342717", "AffiliationID": "119121635", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pediatric Research (IRP), Fondazione Citt\u00e0 della Speranza"}, "36777060000": {"Name": "Cui M.", "AuthorID": "36777060000", "AffiliationID": "60105232", "AffiliationName": "Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies (SIAIS), ShanghaiTech University"}, "24725062000": {"Name": "Luni C.", "AuthorID": "24725062000", "AffiliationID": "60105232", "AffiliationName": "Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies (SIAIS), ShanghaiTech University"}, "6506244036": {"Name": "Caccin P.", "AuthorID": "6506244036", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Science Department, University of Padova"}}}
