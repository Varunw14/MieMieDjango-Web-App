Published by IOP Publishing Ltd Printed in the UKWe study the interaction of a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, carbon monoxide, with a free-electron laser (FEL) pulse. We compute the ion yields and the intermediate states by which the ion yields are populated. We do so using rate equations, computing all relevant molecular and atomic photo-ionisation cross-sections and Auger rates. We find that the charge distribution of the carbon and oxygen ion yields differ. By varying the photon energy, we demonstrate how to control higher-charged states being populated mostly by carbon or oxygen. Moreover, we identify the differences in the resulting ion yields and pathways populating these yields between a homonuclear molecule, molecular nitrogen, and a heteronuclear molecule, carbon monoxide, interacting with an FEL pulse. These two molecules have similar electronic structure. We also identify the proportion of each ion yield which accesses a two-site double-core-hole state and tailor pulse parameters to maximise this proportion.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Molecules interacting with free-electron lasers, homonuclear versus heteronuclear"], "IndexKeywords": ["Charged state", "Heteronuclear diatomic molecule", "Heteronuclear molecules", "Intermediate state", "Molecular nitrogen", "Photon energy", "Pulse parameter", "Rate equations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094972892", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"56727777200": {"Name": "Banks H.I.B.", "AuthorID": "56727777200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57205235713": {"Name": "Hadjipittas A.", "AuthorID": "57205235713", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "6603477664": {"Name": "Emmanouilidou A.", "AuthorID": "6603477664", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
