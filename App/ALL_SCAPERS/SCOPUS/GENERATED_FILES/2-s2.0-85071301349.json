This study investigated whether circulating levels of EGF, VEGF and BDNF were altered in individuals with stress-related exhaustion disorder. Forty patients diagnosed with exhaustion disorder and 40 healthy subjects (50% women) provided fasting blood samples for analysis of EGF, VEGF, and BDNF in plasma. We found significantly lower levels of EGF, VEGF, and BDNF in patients with ED compared to healthy controls. This pattern was seen in both male and female patients. Given the important roles of BDNF and VEGF for brain plasticity and neurogenesis, decreased levels after long-term stress exposure could indicate increased risk of neuronal damage and cognitive impairments in this patient group.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Burnout", "Exhaustion", "Growth factor", "Neurotrophic model", "Neurotrophin", "Stress"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071301349", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"], ["Endocrine and Autonomic Systems", "NEUR", "2807"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"57210729993": {"Name": "Sj\u00f6rsa Dhlman A.", "AuthorID": "57210729993", "AffiliationID": "60050098", "AffiliationName": "The Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute"}, "24166438000": {"Name": "Glise K.", "AuthorID": "24166438000", "AffiliationID": "112714158", "AffiliationName": "The Institute of Stress Medicine, Region V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland"}, "57217764999": {"Name": "Jonsdottir I.H.", "AuthorID": "57217764999", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health and Community Medicine, Institute of Medicine, University of Gothenburg"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "57208899083": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "57208899083", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL"}}}
