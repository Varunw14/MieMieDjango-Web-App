Providing an in-vivo like platform is crucial to evaluate the biological behaviours of nanoparticles. This paper presents a microfluidic device that could culture two cell lines in parallel in in-vivo like fluidic microenvironments and be used for testing the tumor targeting of folic acid - cholesterol - chitosan (FACC) nanoparticles. The uniformity and uniformity of flow fields inside the cell culture units are investigated using the finite element method and particle tracking technology. HeLa and A549 cells are cultured in the microfluidic chip under continuous media supplementation, mimicking the fluid microenvironment in vivo. Cell introducing processes are presented by the flow behaviours of inks with different colours. The two cell lines are identified by detecting folate receptors on the cellular membranes. The growth curves of the two cell lines are measured. The two cell lines cultured paralleled inside the microfluidic device are treated with FITC-FACC to investigate the targeting of FACC. The tumor targeting of FACC are also detected by in vivo imaging of HeLa cells growth in nude mice models. The results indicate that the microfluidic device could provide a dynamic, uniform and stable fluidic microenvironment to test the tumor targeting of FACC nanoparticles.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Microenvironment", "Microfluidic", "Nanoparticles", "Paralleled introducing", "Targeting"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cellular membranes", "Chemically modified", "Micro-fluidic devices", "Microenvironments", "Microfluidic chip", "Microfluidic platforms", "Paralleled introducing", "Targeting", "A549 Cells", "Animals", "Apoptosis", "Cell Proliferation", "Chitosan", "Cholesterol", "Folic Acid", "HeLa Cells", "Humans", "Mice", "Mice, Nude", "Microfluidics", "Nanoparticles", "Neoplasms", "Tumor Microenvironment", "Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072774946", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"]], "AuthorData": {"57190748056": {"Name": "Wei J.", "AuthorID": "57190748056", "AffiliationID": "60004538", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Micro/Nano Technology and System of Liaoning Province, Dalian University of Technology"}, "23995730400": {"Name": "Li J.", "AuthorID": "23995730400", "AffiliationID": "60004538", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Micro/Nano Technology and System of Liaoning Province, Dalian University of Technology"}, "57211141208": {"Name": "Yin S.", "AuthorID": "57211141208", "AffiliationID": "60004538", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Micro/Nano Technology and System of Liaoning Province, Dalian University of Technology"}, "55680743700": {"Name": "Liu C.", "AuthorID": "55680743700", "AffiliationID": "60004538, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Precision and Non-traditional Machining Technology of Ministry of Education, Dalian University of Technology"}, "55938598300": {"Name": "Cheng L.", "AuthorID": "55938598300", "AffiliationID": "60005229", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University"}, "57209287782": {"Name": "Xu B.", "AuthorID": "57209287782", "AffiliationID": "60005229", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University"}, "57211138172": {"Name": "Wang D.", "AuthorID": "57211138172", "AffiliationID": "60005229", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University"}, "36114492300": {"Name": "Lu H.", "AuthorID": "36114492300", "AffiliationID": "60005229", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University"}, "56515441900": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "56515441900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
