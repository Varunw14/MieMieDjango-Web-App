Given our unique access to patients with neurologic disorders, expertise with which to guide appropriate treatments, and technical skills to implant brain\u2013machine interfaces (BMIs), neurosurgeons have a key role to play in the progress of this field. We outline the current state and key challenges in this rapidly advancing field, including implant technology, implant recipients, implantation methodology, implant function, and ethical, regulatory, and economic considerations. Our key message is to encourage the neurosurgical community to proactively engage in collaborating with other health care professionals, engineers, scientists, ethicists, and regulators in tackling these issues. By doing so, we will equip ourselves with the skills and expertise to drive the field forward and avoid being mere technicians in an industry driven by those around us.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bioethics", "Brain\u2013computer interface", "Brain\u2013machine interface", "Microelectrode", "Neuroprostheses", "Neurotechnology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85097160796", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55204436800": {"Name": "Chari A.", "AuthorID": "55204436800", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "16242763100": {"Name": "Tisdall M.M.", "AuthorID": "16242763100", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "36015055300": {"Name": "Budhdeo S.", "AuthorID": "36015055300", "AffiliationID": "121489541", "AffiliationName": "OwkinInc."}, "16643089500": {"Name": "Marcus H.J.", "AuthorID": "16643089500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences, University College London"}, "57219298090": {"Name": "Sparks R.", "AuthorID": "57219298090", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "56068056300": {"Name": "Barone D.G.", "AuthorID": "56068056300", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurosurgery, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge"}, "57196768210": {"Name": "Pereira E.A.C.", "AuthorID": "57196768210", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Neurosciences Research Centre, Molecular and Clinical Sciences Research Institute, St George's, University of London"}}}
