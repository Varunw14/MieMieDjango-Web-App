Less is known about the role of wellbeing for subclinical disease trajectories as captured via glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). We aimed to explore the association between subjective wellbeing and future HbA1c levels, and the role of sociodemographic, behavioral and clinical factors in this association.Methods We used data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing for this study (N = 2161). Subjective wellbeing (CASP-19) was measured at wave 2 and HbA1c was measured 8 years later at wave 6. Participants were free from diabetes at baseline. We conducted a series of analyses to examine the extent to which the association was accounted for by a range of sociodemographic, behavioral and clinical factors in linear regression models.Results Models showed that subjective wellbeing (CASP-19 total score) was inversely associated with HbA1c 8 years later after controlling for depressive symptoms, age, sex, and baseline HbA1c (B = -0.035, 95% CI -0.060 to -0.011, p = 0.005). Inclusion of sociodemographic variables and behavioral factors in models accounted for a large proportion (17.0% and 24.5%, respectively) of the relationship between wellbeing and later HbA1c; clinical risk factors explained a smaller proportion of the relationship (3.4%).Conclusions Poorer subjective wellbeing is associated with greater HbA1c over 8 years of follow-up and this relationship can in part be explained by sociodemographic, behavioral and clinical factors among older adults.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ageing", "depressive symptoms", "glycated hemoglobin", "HbA1c", "longitudinal", "mood", "wellbeing"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071937262", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"36946348400": {"Name": "Poole L.", "AuthorID": "36946348400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "55177075200": {"Name": "Hackett R.A.", "AuthorID": "55177075200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "57205510690": {"Name": "Panagi L.", "AuthorID": "57205510690", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "7102289942": {"Name": "Steptoe A.", "AuthorID": "7102289942", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}}}
