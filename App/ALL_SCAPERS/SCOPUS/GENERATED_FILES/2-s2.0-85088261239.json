This paper aims to present a comprehensive literature review on full-scale types of quantitative models in emission trading system research. The models dominating emission trading system-related literature can be categorized as optimization models, simulation models, assessment models, statistical models, artificial intelligences and ensemble models. Using different quantification and solution tools, these models complemented and enriched each other in serving the various agents involved in emission trading system and facilitating their respective emission trading system related works: the government to design emission trading system policies, enterprises to participate in emission trading system and goods markets, third parties to regulate emission trading system and emission trading system markets involving different agents. For each agent, a systematic analysis is provided on research hotspots (the challenges to address), quantitative models (to describe the problems and find the results), main findings (the policy implications from the models) and future research (potential improvements on existing models). Some conclusions are obtained. (1) Generally, China was the largest contributor to emission trading system research using quantitative models (representing 35.71% of the total articles). (2) The research hotspots were decision making by enterprises under an emission trading system (20.92%), spillovers amongst emission trading system and other markets (17.54%) and allowance allocation by the government (12.52%). (3) Popular quantitative models included various optimization models (32.00%) and simulation models (29.64%).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Allowance allocation", "Carbon cap-and-trade", "Carbon markets", "Computable general equilibrium model", "Data envelopment analysis", "Measuring, reporting and verification"], "IndexKeywords": ["Assessment models", "Climate change policies", "Emission trading systems", "Literature reviews", "Optimization models", "Policy implications", "Quantitative models", "Systematic analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088261239", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"]], "AuthorData": {"48361896000": {"Name": "Tang L.", "AuthorID": "48361896000", "AffiliationID": "60021843", "AffiliationName": "School of Economics and Management, Beijing University of Chemical Technology"}, "57218201137": {"Name": "Wang H.", "AuthorID": "57218201137", "AffiliationID": "60021843", "AffiliationName": "School of Economics and Management, Beijing University of Chemical Technology"}, "57218198792": {"Name": "Yang K.", "AuthorID": "57218198792", "AffiliationID": "60021843", "AffiliationName": "School of Economics and Management, Beijing University of Chemical Technology"}, "56650496000": {"Name": "Li L.", "AuthorID": "56650496000", "AffiliationID": "60014337", "AffiliationName": "International School of Economics and Management, Capital University of Economics and Business"}, "55272317400": {"Name": "Mi Z.", "AuthorID": "55272317400", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London"}}}
