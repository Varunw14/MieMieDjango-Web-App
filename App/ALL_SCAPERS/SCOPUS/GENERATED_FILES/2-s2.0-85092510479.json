Four subtypes exist, characterized by different clinical severities. New therapeutic approaches have become available in the past few years, dramatically changing the natural history of all SMA subtypes, including substantial clinical improvement with the severe and advanced SMA type 1 variant. Trials have now demonstrated that phenotypic rescue is even more dramatic when pre-symptomatic patients are treated, and emerging real-world data are demonstrating the benefits of intervention even in the chronic phase of the condition. Here, we critically review how the field is rapidly evolving in response to the new therapies and questions that the new treatments have posed, including the effects of treatment at different ages and stages of disease, new phenotypes and long-term outcomes in patients who would not have survived without treatment, and decisions of who to treat and when. We also discuss how the outcomes associated with different timing of therapeutic intervention are contributing to our understanding of the biology and pathogenesis of SMA.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092510479", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"57211220608": {"Name": "Mercuri E.", "AuthorID": "57211220608", "AffiliationID": "60073799", "AffiliationName": "Centro Clinico Nemo, Fondazione Policlinico Gemelli IRCCS"}, "55177172900": {"Name": "Pera M.C.", "AuthorID": "55177172900", "AffiliationID": "60073799", "AffiliationName": "Centro Clinico Nemo, Fondazione Policlinico Gemelli IRCCS"}, "55675111500": {"Name": "Scoto M.", "AuthorID": "55675111500", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60172638, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7102038246": {"Name": "Muntoni F.", "AuthorID": "7102038246", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60172638, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7006041140": {"Name": "Finkel R.", "AuthorID": "7006041140", "AffiliationID": "60019905", "AffiliationName": "Center for Experimental Neurotherapeutics, St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital"}}}
