The acute phase of imaging a new disease entity whilst rationalising radiology services in the face of lockdown has passed. Radiologists are now becoming familiar with the complications of COVID-19, particularly the lung parenchymal and pulmonary vascular sequelae and are considering the impact follow-up imaging may have on departments already struggling with a backlog of suspended imaging in the face of reduced capacity. This review from the British Society of Thoracic Imaging explores both the thoracic and extra-thoracic complications of COVID-19, recognising the importance of a holistic approach to patient follow-up. The British Thoracic Society guidelines for respiratory follow-up of COVID-19 will be discussed, together with newly developed reporting templates, which aim to provide consistency for clinicians as well as an opportunity for longer-term data collection.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Brain", "Brain Diseases", "COVID-19", "Gastrointestinal Diseases", "Gastrointestinal Tract", "Heart", "Heart Diseases", "Humans", "Lung", "Radiology Department, Hospital", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85093949655", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57215873198": {"Name": "McStay R.", "AuthorID": "57215873198", "AffiliationID": "60018514, 60001239", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24590168800": {"Name": "Johnstone A.", "AuthorID": "24590168800", "AffiliationID": "60006866, 60012508", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Leeds General Infirmary"}, "56730366800": {"Name": "Hare S.S.", "AuthorID": "56730366800", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Royal Free London NHS Trust, London"}, "55547631800": {"Name": "Rodrigues J.C.L.", "AuthorID": "55547631800", "AffiliationID": "60027647", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Royal United Hospitals Bath NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57216143067": {"Name": "Robinson G.", "AuthorID": "57216143067", "AffiliationID": "60027647", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Royal United Hospitals Bath NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36241963000": {"Name": "Nair A.", "AuthorID": "36241963000", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University College London Hospital"}, "57202517377": {"Name": "Jacob J.", "AuthorID": "57202517377", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "24512081600": {"Name": "Edey A.", "AuthorID": "24512081600", "AffiliationID": "60016447, 60027676", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Southmead Hospital, North Bristol NHS Trust"}}}
