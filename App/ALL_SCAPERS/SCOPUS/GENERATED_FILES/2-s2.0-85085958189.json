Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Background: The monogenic defect in familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is detected in \u223c40% of cases. The majority of mutation-negative patients have a polygenic cause of high LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C). We sought to investigate whether the underlying monogenic or polygenic defect is associated with the response to rosuvastatin. Methods: FH Individuals were tested for mutations in LDLR and APOB genes. A previously established LDL-C-specific polygenic risk score (PRS) was used to examine the possibility of polygenic hypercholesterolemia in mutation-negative patients. All of the patients received rosuvastatin and they were followed for 8 \u00b1 2 months. A propensity score analysis was performed to evaluate the variables associated with the response to treatment. Results: Monogenic subjects had higher mean (\u00b1SD) baseline LDL-C when compared to polygenic (7.6 \u00b1 1.5 mmol/L vs. 6.2 \u00b1 1.2 mmol/L; p < 0.001). Adjusted model showed a lower percentage of change in LDL-C after rosuvastatin treatment in monogenic patients vs. polygenic subjects (45.9% vs. 55.4%, p < 0.001). The probability of achieving LDL-C targets in monogenic FH was lower than in polygenic subjects (0.075 vs. 0.245, p = 0.004). Polygenic patients were more likely to achieve LDL-C goals, as compared to those monogenic (OR 3.28; 95% CI: 1.23\u2013 8.72). Conclusion: Our findings indicate an essentially higher responsiveness to rosuvastatin in FH patients with a polygenic cause, as compared to those carrying monogenic mutations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Monogenic hypercholesterolemia", "Polygenic hypercholesterolemia", "Propensity score", "Rosuvastatin"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085958189", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"], ["Paleontology", "EART", "1911"]], "AuthorData": {"57003672700": {"Name": "Mickiewicz A.", "AuthorID": "57003672700", "AffiliationID": "60012383", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology I, Medical University of Gdansk"}, "14044833300": {"Name": "Fija\u0142kowski M.", "AuthorID": "14044833300", "AffiliationID": "60012383", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology I, Medical University of Gdansk"}, "56175177200": {"Name": "Jaguszewski M.", "AuthorID": "56175177200", "AffiliationID": "60012383", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology I, Medical University of Gdansk"}, "6602138765": {"Name": "Grucha\u0142a M.", "AuthorID": "6602138765", "AffiliationID": "60012383", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology I, Medical University of Gdansk"}, "55446094500": {"Name": "Futema M.", "AuthorID": "55446094500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Heart Muscle Disease, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "35776055000": {"Name": "\u0106wiklinska A.", "AuthorID": "35776055000", "AffiliationID": "60012383", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Chemistry, Medical University of Gdansk"}, "36813710900": {"Name": "Kuchta A.", "AuthorID": "36813710900", "AffiliationID": "60012383", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Chemistry, Medical University of Gdansk"}, "7005450481": {"Name": "Jankowski M.", "AuthorID": "7005450481", "AffiliationID": "60012383", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Chemistry, Medical University of Gdansk"}, "56801837800": {"Name": "Kaszubowski M.", "AuthorID": "56801837800", "AffiliationID": "60027012", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Statistics, Department of Economic Sciences, Faculty of Management and Economics, Gdansk University of Technology"}, "8237648600": {"Name": "Chmara M.", "AuthorID": "8237648600", "AffiliationID": "60012383", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology and Genetics, Medical University of Gdansk"}, "6602952883": {"Name": "Was\u0105g B.", "AuthorID": "6602952883", "AffiliationID": "60012383", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology and Genetics, Medical University of Gdansk"}, "57217317601": {"Name": "Humphries S.E.", "AuthorID": "57217317601", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60100024", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Genetics, British Heart Foundation Laboratories, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, the Rayne Building University College London"}}}
