Purkyne. All rights reserved.Introduction: Achromatopsia is an autosomal recessive retinal disorder with an estimated prevalence ranging from 1 in 30.000 to 50.000. The disease is caused by mutations in six different genes. The aim of the study was to perform molecular genetic analysis in 11 unrelated probands with a clinical diagnosis of achromatopsia and to describe clinical findings in those that were found to carry biallelic pathogenic mutations. Methods: All probands and their parents underwent ophthalmic examination. Mutation detection was performed using Sanger sequencing of CNGB3 exons 6, 7, 9-13, which have been found to harbour most disease-causing mutations in patients with achromatopsia of European origin. Results: Three known pathogenic variants in CNGB3 were identified in 2 probands. Proband 1 was a compound heterozygote for the c.819_826del; p.(Arg274Valfs*13) and c.1006G>T; p.(Glu336*). Proband 2 carried the c.1148del; p.(Thr383Ilefs*13) in a homozygous state. The best corrected acuity in proband 1 (aged 19 years) was 0.1 in both eyes, in proband 2 (aged 8 years) 0.05 in the right eye and 0.1 in the left eye. Both individuals had nystagmus, photophobia, and absence of colour discrimination. Fundus examination appeared normal however spectral-domain optical coherence tomography revealed subtle bilaterally symmetrical structural changes in the fovea. Conclusion: Molecular genetic analysis of Czech patients with achromatopsia was performed for the first time. Identification of disease-causing mutations in achromatopsia is important for establishing an early diagnosis, participation in clinical trials assessing gene therapies and may be also used for preimplantation genetic diagnosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Achromatopsia", "CNGB3", "The Czech population"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Color Vision Defects", "Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Cation Channels", "Czech Republic", "DNA Mutational Analysis", "Humans", "Mutation", "Pedigree", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084592385", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"57188767213": {"Name": "Hlavat\u00e1 L.", "AuthorID": "57188767213", "AffiliationID": "60016605", "AffiliationName": "Klinika d\u011btsk\u00e9ho a dorostov\u00e9ho l\u00e9ka\u0159stv\u00ed, 1. l\u00e9ka\u0159sk\u00e1 fakulta, Univerzita Karlova a V\u0161eobecn\u00e1 fakultn\u00ed nemocnice v Praze"}, "51763434300": {"Name": "\u010eu\u010f\u00e1kov\u00e1", "AuthorID": "51763434300", "AffiliationID": "60016605", "AffiliationName": "Klinika d\u011btsk\u00e9ho a dorostov\u00e9ho l\u00e9ka\u0159stv\u00ed, 1. l\u00e9ka\u0159sk\u00e1 fakulta, Univerzita Karlova a V\u0161eobecn\u00e1 fakultn\u00ed nemocnice v Praze"}, "57216763299": {"Name": "Morav\u00edkov\u00e1 J.", "AuthorID": "57216763299", "AffiliationID": "60016605", "AffiliationName": "Klinika d\u011btsk\u00e9ho a dorostov\u00e9ho l\u00e9ka\u0159stv\u00ed, 1. l\u00e9ka\u0159sk\u00e1 fakulta, Univerzita Karlova a V\u0161eobecn\u00e1 fakultn\u00ed nemocnice v Praze"}, "57193414772": {"Name": "Kousal B.", "AuthorID": "57193414772", "AffiliationID": "60016605", "AffiliationName": "O\u010dn\u00ed klinika, 1. l\u00e9ka\u0159sk\u00e1 fakulta, Univerzita Karlova a V\u0161eobecn\u00e1 fakultn\u00ed nemocnice v Praze"}, "57202781067": {"Name": "Li\u0161kov\u00e1 P.", "AuthorID": "57202781067", "AffiliationID": "60016605", "AffiliationName": "O\u010dn\u00ed klinika, 1. l\u00e9ka\u0159sk\u00e1 fakulta, Univerzita Karlova a V\u0161eobecn\u00e1 fakultn\u00ed nemocnice v Praze"}, "6506509056": {"Name": "Zobanov\u00e1 A.", "AuthorID": "6506509056", "AffiliationID": "125084116", "AffiliationName": "Soukrom\u00e1 o\u010dn\u00ed ordinace MUDr. Anna Zobanov\u00e1, Poliklinika Barrandov v Praze"}}}
