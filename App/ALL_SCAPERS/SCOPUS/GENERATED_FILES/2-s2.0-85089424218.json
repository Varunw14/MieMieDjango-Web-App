The assessment of marine ecosystem health is challenging and often relies on monitoring indicator species, such as cetaceans. Most cetaceans are however highly mobile and spend the majority of their time hidden from direct view, resulting in uncertainty on even the most basic population metrics. Here, we discuss the value of long-term and internationally combined stranding records as a valuable source of information on the demographic and mortality trends of the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) in the North Sea. We analysed stranding records (n = 16,181) from 1990 to 2017 and demonstrate a strong heterogeneous seasonal pattern of strandings throughout the North Sea, indicative of season-specific distribution or habitat use, and season-specific mortality. The annual incidence of strandings has increased since 1990, with a notable steeper rise particularly in the southern North Sea since 2005. A high density of neonatal strandings occurred specifically in the eastern North Sea, indicative of areas important for calving, and large numbers of juvenile males stranded in the southern parts, indicative of a population sink or reflecting higher male dispersion. These findings highlight the power of stranding records to detect potentially vulnerable population groups in time and space. This knowledge is vital for managers and can guide, for example, conservation measures such as the establishment of time-area-specific limits to potentially harmful human activities, aiming to reduce the number and intensity of human-wildlife conflicts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Harbour porpoise", "Marine mammal", "Mortality", "North Sea", "Phocoena phocoena", "Surveillance programme", "Wildlife monitoring"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089424218", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Nature and Landscape Conservation", "ENVI", "2309"]], "AuthorData": {"56401851100": {"Name": "IJsseldijk L.L.", "AuthorID": "56401851100", "AffiliationID": "60117220, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Department of Biomolecular Health Sciences, Division of Pathology, Utrecht University"}, "57053255100": {"Name": "ten Doeschate M.T.I.", "AuthorID": "57053255100", "AffiliationID": "124973947", "AffiliationName": "Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme, SRUC Northern Faculty"}, "7003914139": {"Name": "Gr\u00f6ne A.", "AuthorID": "7003914139", "AffiliationID": "60117220, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Department of Biomolecular Health Sciences, Division of Pathology, Utrecht University"}, "55245783300": {"Name": "Brownlow A.", "AuthorID": "55245783300", "AffiliationID": "124973947", "AffiliationName": "Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme, SRUC Northern Faculty"}, "6603887563": {"Name": "Davison N.J.", "AuthorID": "6603887563", "AffiliationID": "124973947", "AffiliationName": "Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme, SRUC Northern Faculty"}, "6603658704": {"Name": "Deaville R.", "AuthorID": "6603658704", "AffiliationID": "60009498, 60005453", "AffiliationName": "UK Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme, Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "7006738308": {"Name": "Jepson P.D.", "AuthorID": "7006738308", "AffiliationID": "60009498, 60005453", "AffiliationName": "UK Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme, Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "6507966379": {"Name": "Galatius A.", "AuthorID": "6507966379", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioscience, Aarhus University"}, "14025535600": {"Name": "Gilles A.", "AuthorID": "14025535600", "AffiliationID": "60011610", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Terrestrial and Aquatic Wildlife Research, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover"}, "7004796609": {"Name": "Siebert U.", "AuthorID": "7004796609", "AffiliationID": "60011610", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Terrestrial and Aquatic Wildlife Research, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover"}, "7801476922": {"Name": "Haelters J.", "AuthorID": "7801476922", "AffiliationID": "60068588", "AffiliationName": "Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, Operational Directorate Natural Environment"}, "6505993867": {"Name": "Keijl G.O.", "AuthorID": "6505993867", "AffiliationID": "60032678", "AffiliationName": "Naturalis Biodiversity Center"}, "35610440400": {"Name": "Kinze C.C.", "AuthorID": "35610440400", "AffiliationID": "124974178", "AffiliationName": "Cetacean Atlas of Denmark"}, "55351754300": {"Name": "Olsen M.T.", "AuthorID": "55351754300", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Natural History Museum of Denmark, University of Copenhagen"}, "57218530634": {"Name": "Th\u00f8stesen C.B.", "AuthorID": "57218530634", "AffiliationID": "106566940", "AffiliationName": "Fisheries and Maritime Museum"}, "7005299648": {"Name": "van den Broek J.", "AuthorID": "7005299648", "AffiliationID": "60117220, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Department of Population Health Sciences, Utrecht University"}, "57215587535": {"Name": "Heesterbeek H.", "AuthorID": "57215587535", "AffiliationID": "60117220, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Department of Population Health Sciences, Utrecht University"}}}
