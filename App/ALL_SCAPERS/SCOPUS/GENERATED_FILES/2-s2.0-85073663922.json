Human Mutation Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2 disease) is an autosomal recessive condition caused by variants in the TPP1 gene, leading to deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme tripeptidyl peptidase I (TPP1). We update on the spectrum of TPP1 variants associated with CLN2 disease, comprising 131 unique variants from 389 individuals (717 alleles) collected from the literature review, public databases, and laboratory communications. Previously unrecorded individuals were added to the UCL TPP1-specific database. Two known pathogenic variants, c.509\u20131 G>C and c.622 C>T (p.(Arg208*)), collectively occur in 60% of affected individuals in the sample, and account for 50% of disease-associated alleles. At least 86 variants (66%) are private to single families. Homozygosity occurs in 45% of individuals where both alleles are known (87% of reported individuals). Atypical CLN2 disease, TPP1 enzyme deficiency with disease onset and/or progression distinct from classic late-infantile CLN2, represents 13% of individuals recorded with associated phenotype. NCBI ClinVar currently holds records for 37% of variants collected here. Effective CLN2 disease management requires early diagnosis; however, irreversible neurodegeneration occurs before a diagnosis is typically reached at age 5. Timely classification and public reporting of TPP1 variants is essential as molecular testing increases in use as a first-line diagnostic test for pediatric-onset neurological disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["genotype\u2013phenotype correlation", "late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis", "lysosomal storage disorders", "neurodegeneration", "tripeptidyl peptidase I"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alleles", "Aminopeptidases", "Animals", "Biomarkers", "Databases, Genetic", "Dipeptidyl-Peptidases and Tripeptidyl-Peptidases", "Disease Models, Animal", "Genetic Association Studies", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genotype", "Humans", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Mutation", "Neuronal Ceroid-Lipofuscinoses", "Phenotype", "Protein Conformation", "Serine Proteases", "Structure-Activity Relationship"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073663922", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"57211371958": {"Name": "Gardner E.", "AuthorID": "57211371958", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "UCL MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology and UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "54960978000": {"Name": "Aristorena M.", "AuthorID": "54960978000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "UCL MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology and UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7005160390": {"Name": "Mole S.E.", "AuthorID": "7005160390", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "UCL MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology and UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57203910925": {"Name": "Bailey M.", "AuthorID": "57203910925", "AffiliationID": "60003426", "AffiliationName": "Global Scientific Affairs, BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc"}, "56219561100": {"Name": "Miller N.", "AuthorID": "56219561100", "AffiliationID": "60003426", "AffiliationName": "Global Scientific Affairs, BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc"}, "56506376300": {"Name": "Schulz A.", "AuthorID": "56506376300", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"}}}
