However, there is no specific treatment to prevent progression of small vessel disease. Aim: We designed the LACunar Intervention Trial-2 (LACI-2) to test feasibility of a large trial testing cilostazol and/or isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN) by demonstrating adequate participant recruitment and retention in follow-up, drug tolerability, safety and confirm outcome event rates required to power a phase 3 trial. Methods and design: LACI-2 is an investigator-initiated, prospective randomised open label blinded endpoint (PROBE) trial aiming to recruit 400 patients with prior lacunar syndrome due to a small subcortical infarct. We randomise participants to cilostazol v no cilostazol and ISMN or no ISMN, minimising on key prognostic factors. All patients receive guideline-based best medical therapy. Patients commence trial drug at low dose, increment to full dose over 2\u20134 weeks, continuing on full dose for a year. We follow-up participants to one year for symptoms, tablet compliance, safety, recurrent vascular events, cognition and functional outcomes, Trails B and brain MRI. LACI-2 is registered ISRCTN 14911850, EudraCT 2016\u2013002277-35. Trial outcome: Primary outcome is feasibility of recruitment and compliance; secondary outcomes include safety (cerebral or systemic bleeding, falls, death), efficacy (recurrent cerebral and cardiac vascular events, cognition on TICS, Trails B) and tolerability. Summary: LACI-2 will determine feasibility, tolerability and provide outcome rates to power a large phase 3 trial to prevent progression of cerebral small vessel disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cilostazol", "isosorbide mononitrate", "Lacunar stroke", "randomised clinical trial", "small vessel disease"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084078813", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"35417533500": {"Name": "Wardlaw J.", "AuthorID": "35417533500", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "The University of Edinburgh"}, "23984561000": {"Name": "Doubal F.", "AuthorID": "23984561000", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "The University of Edinburgh"}, "56377981800": {"Name": "Heye A.", "AuthorID": "56377981800", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "The University of Edinburgh"}, "57189058643": {"Name": "Blair G.", "AuthorID": "57189058643", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "The University of Edinburgh"}, "6507716762": {"Name": "Cvoro V.", "AuthorID": "6507716762", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "The University of Edinburgh"}, "24723490800": {"Name": "Bath P.M.W.", "AuthorID": "24723490800", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Trials Unit, Division of Clinical Neuroscience, The University of Nottingham"}, "8852214500": {"Name": "Sprigg N.", "AuthorID": "8852214500", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Trials Unit, Division of Clinical Neuroscience, The University of Nottingham"}, "7101801762": {"Name": "Montgomery A.", "AuthorID": "7101801762", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Trials Unit, Division of Clinical Neuroscience, The University of Nottingham"}, "56050545500": {"Name": "Woodhouse L.J.", "AuthorID": "56050545500", "AffiliationID": "60006343", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire"}, "57191074693": {"Name": "Appleton J.", "AuthorID": "57191074693", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "University of Nottingham"}, "7003377869": {"Name": "England T.", "AuthorID": "7003377869", "AffiliationID": "60006866", "AffiliationName": "Leeds General Infirmary"}, "7402686940": {"Name": "Hassan A.", "AuthorID": "7402686940", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "57216618983": {"Name": "John Werring D.", "AuthorID": "57216618983", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
