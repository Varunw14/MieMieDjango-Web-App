Research question: What are the lower limb EMG activation levels and cadence when running up and downhill in normal and reduced gravity? Methods: 10 recreationally active male athletes ran on a positive-pressure Alter-G\u2122 treadmill at: 3 indicated bodyweights (60 %, 80 %, and 100 %); 5 speeds (12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 km/h); for incline, decline, and flat conditions (-15 %, -10 %, -5%, 0%, 5%, 10 %, and 15 %); while monitoring the surface EMG of 11 leg muscles as well as cadence (strides per minute). Results and significance: Linear mixed models showed significant effect of running speed, inclination, and indicated bodyweight, with interaction effects observed. Increasing running speed was associated with the largest change in activity, with smaller effects for increasing bodyweight and inclination. Downhill running was associated with reduced activity in all muscle groups, and more tightly clustered activity patterns independent of speed. Substantial variation in sEMG activity occurred in the flat and uphill conditions. Subject responses were quite variable for sEMG, less so for cadence. For the conditions examined, increasing running speed induced the largest changes in EMG of all muscles examined with smaller changes seen for manipulations of inclination and bodyweight.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Activation", "Alter-G", "Decline", "Incline", "Leg", "Muscle", "Positive pressure treadmill"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095440836", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"], ["Rehabilitation", "MEDI", "2742"]], "AuthorData": {"16044158000": {"Name": "Whiteley R.", "AuthorID": "16044158000", "AffiliationID": "60105844", "AffiliationName": "Aspetar Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine Hospital, Rehabilitation Department"}, "56689114000": {"Name": "Thomson A.", "AuthorID": "56689114000", "AffiliationID": "60105844", "AffiliationName": "Aspetar Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine Hospital, Rehabilitation Department"}, "55604679200": {"Name": "Sideris V.", "AuthorID": "55604679200", "AffiliationID": "60105844", "AffiliationName": "Aspetar Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine Hospital, Rehabilitation Department"}, "25825824400": {"Name": "Wilson M.G.", "AuthorID": "25825824400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health, University College London"}, "55604204900": {"Name": "Hansen C.", "AuthorID": "55604204900", "AffiliationID": "60012345, 60005542", "AffiliationName": "Neurogeriatrics Kiel, Kiel University, Department of Neurology, UKSH Campus Kiel"}}}
