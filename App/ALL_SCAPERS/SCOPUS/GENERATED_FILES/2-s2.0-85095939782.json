Originally developed for biomedical applications in Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) to address the need for custom, non-linear refinement in certain areas (e.g. around electrodes), EIT-MESHER can also be used in other fields where custom FEM refinement is required, such as Diffuse Optical Tomography (DOT).", "AuthorKeywords": ["C++", "Diffuse Optical Tomography", "Electrical Impedance Tomography", "Finite Element Models", "Mesh Generation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095939782", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Library and Information Sciences", "SOCI", "3309"]], "AuthorData": {"24802061500": {"Name": "Dowrick T.", "AuthorID": "24802061500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Surgical and Interventional Sciences, University College"}, "56673693400": {"Name": "Avery J.", "AuthorID": "56673693400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}, "57189592788": {"Name": "Faulkner M.", "AuthorID": "57189592788", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College"}, "57205935474": {"Name": "Holder D.", "AuthorID": "57205935474", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College"}, "26040428500": {"Name": "Aristovich K.", "AuthorID": "26040428500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College"}}}
