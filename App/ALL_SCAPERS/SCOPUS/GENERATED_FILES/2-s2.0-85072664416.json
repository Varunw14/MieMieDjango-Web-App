Whilst restricted resources are clearly part of the root causes of the crisis, a contested identity of forensic science is also a significant factor. A consensus is needed on the identity of forensic science that encompasses what forensic science \u2018is\u2019, and critically, what it is \u2018for\u2019. A consistent and cogent identity that is developed collaboratively and accepted across the entire justice system is critical for establishing the different attributes of the crisis and being able to articulate effective solutions. The degree to which forensic science is considered to be a coherent, interdisciplinary yet unified discipline will determine how forensic science develops, the challenges it is able to address, and how successful it will be in overcoming the current crisis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Forensic science", "Funding", "Identity", "Interdisciplinary", "Policy", "Value"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072664416", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"57194780985": {"Name": "Morgan R.M.", "AuthorID": "57194780985", "AffiliationID": "60176024, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for the Forensic Sciences, UCL Department of Security and Crime Science"}}}
