We postulated that a community-based participatory intervention could significantly reduce neonatal mortality rates. Methods We pair-matched 42 geopolitical clusters in Makwanpur district, Nepal, selected 12 pairs randomly, and randomly assigned one of each pair to intervention or control. In each intervention cluster (average population 7000), a female facilitator convened nine women\u2019s group meetings every month. The facilitator supported groups through an action-learning cycle in which they identified local perinatal problems and formulated strategies to address them. We monitored birth outcomes in a cohort o f 28 931 women, o f whom 8% joined the groups. The primary outcome was neonatal mortality rate. Other outcomes included stillbirths and maternal deaths, uptake of antenatal and delivery services, home care practices, infant morbidity, and health-care seeking. Analysis was by intention to treat. The study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN31137309. Findings From 2001 to 2003, the neonatal mortality rate was 26-2 per 1000 (76 deaths per 2899 livebirths) in intervention clusters compared with 36 -9 per 1000 (119 deaths per 3226 livebirths) in controls (adjusted odds ratio 0-70 [95% Cl 0-53-0-94]). Stillbirth rates were similar in both groups. The maternal mortality ratio was 69 per 100000 (two deaths per 2899 livebirths) in intervention clusters compared with 341 per 100000 (11 deaths per 3226 livebirths) in control clusters (0-22 [0-05-0-90]). Women in intervention clusters were more likely to have antenatal care, institutional delivery, trained birth attendance, and hygienic care than were controls. Interpretation Birth outcomes in a poor rural population improved greatly through a low cost, potentially sustainable and scalable, participatory intervention with women\u2019s groups.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077637958", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"12767143700": {"Name": "Manandhar D.S.", "AuthorID": "12767143700", "AffiliationID": "100774087", "AffiliationName": "Mother and Infant Research Activities (MIRA)"}, "6504368713": {"Name": "Prasad Shrestha B.", "AuthorID": "6504368713", "AffiliationID": "100774087", "AffiliationName": "Mother and Infant Research Activities (MIRA)"}, "57215346326": {"Name": "Man Tumhahangphe K.", "AuthorID": "57215346326", "AffiliationID": "100774087", "AffiliationName": "Mother and Infant Research Activities (MIRA)"}, "55918651300": {"Name": "Tamang S.", "AuthorID": "55918651300", "AffiliationID": "100774087", "AffiliationName": "Mother and Infant Research Activities (MIRA)"}, "57208447675": {"Name": "Thapa S.", "AuthorID": "57208447675", "AffiliationID": "100774087", "AffiliationName": "Mother and Infant Research Activities (MIRA)"}, "7003745628": {"Name": "Shrestha D.", "AuthorID": "7003745628", "AffiliationID": "100774087", "AffiliationName": "Mother and Infant Research Activities (MIRA)"}, "36795894000": {"Name": "Thapa B.", "AuthorID": "36795894000", "AffiliationID": "100774087", "AffiliationName": "Mother and Infant Research Activities (MIRA)"}, "6504257914": {"Name": "Raj Shrestha J.", "AuthorID": "6504257914", "AffiliationID": "100774087", "AffiliationName": "Mother and Infant Research Activities (MIRA)"}, "6603217003": {"Name": "Osrin D.", "AuthorID": "6603217003", "AffiliationID": "123738674", "AffiliationName": "International Perinatal Care Unit"}, "56089372600": {"Name": "Mesko N.", "AuthorID": "56089372600", "AffiliationID": "123738674", "AffiliationName": "International Perinatal Care Unit"}, "9435917600": {"Name": "Morrison J.", "AuthorID": "9435917600", "AffiliationID": "123738674", "AffiliationName": "International Perinatal Care Unit"}, "6603053391": {"Name": "Borghi J.", "AuthorID": "6603053391", "AffiliationID": "123738674", "AffiliationName": "International Perinatal Care Unit"}, "57215361453": {"Name": "Mde L Costello A.", "AuthorID": "57215361453", "AffiliationID": "123738674", "AffiliationName": "International Perinatal Care Unit"}, "7202754332": {"Name": "Wade A.", "AuthorID": "7202754332", "AffiliationID": "123738674", "AffiliationName": "International Perinatal Care Unit, Centre for Paediatric Epidemiology and Biostatistics"}, "6602315561": {"Name": "Standing H.", "AuthorID": "6602315561", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012662, 60079674", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London, Institute of Development Studies"}, "6603945081": {"Name": "Manandhar M.", "AuthorID": "6603945081", "AffiliationID": "100597569", "AffiliationName": "Nepal Administrative Staff College"}}}
