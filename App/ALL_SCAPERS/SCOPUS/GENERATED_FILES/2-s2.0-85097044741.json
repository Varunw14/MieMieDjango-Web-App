The NF-\u03baB pathway integrates signals from many receptors and involves diverse adapters and kinases. Recent advances demonstrate that kinases controlling NF-\u03baB activation, such as the IKK complex, serve dual independent functions because they also control cell death checkpoints. Survival functions previously attributed to NF-\u03baB are in fact mediated by these upstream kinases by novel mechanisms. This new understanding has led to a refined view of how NF-\u03baB and cell death signaling are interlinked and how they regulate cell fate. We discuss how NF-\u03baB activation and control of cell death signaling by common upstream triggers cooperate to regulate different aspects of T cell development and function.", "AuthorKeywords": ["apoptosis", "necroptosis", "nuclear factor \u03baB", "T cells"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85097044741", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"57221505200": {"Name": "Blanchett S.", "AuthorID": "57221505200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "54890725100": {"Name": "Boal-Carvalho I.", "AuthorID": "54890725100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57220157306": {"Name": "Layzell S.", "AuthorID": "57220157306", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7006500719": {"Name": "Seddon B.", "AuthorID": "7006500719", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
