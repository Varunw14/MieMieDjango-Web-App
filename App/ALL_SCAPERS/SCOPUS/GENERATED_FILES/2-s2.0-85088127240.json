Ninety-four female patients \u2013 44 with anorexia nervosa (AN) and 50 with bulimia nervosa (BN) \u2013 were assessed with SAI-ED. The Brown Assessment of Beliefs Scale was used to evaluate convergent validity of SAI-ED. Hierarchical cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling were used to identify insight components and assess their inter-relationships. The final 8-item SAI-ED demonstrated good psychometric properties. Inter-rater and test-retest reliabilities were high. Three subscales of SAI-ED were identified which measure major insight components: awareness of illness, awareness of symptoms, and treatment engagement. Patients with AN had significant lower score on SAI-ED than patients with BN. Impaired insight was associated with: (a) lower current and lowest lifetime BMI and more severe dietary restrain in AN, (b) illness duration, severity of overall ED symptoms, body-related concerns and obsessionality in BN. Insight is a multidimensional construct in EDs associated with different clinical aspects in AN and BN. The SAI-ED is a valid and reliable tool for the assessment of insight in EDs patients.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anorexia Nervosa", "Bulimia Nervosa", "Feeding and Eating Disorders", "Female", "Humans", "Interview, Psychological", "Psychometrics", "Reproducibility of Results", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088127240", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"16425957400": {"Name": "Konstantakopoulos G.", "AuthorID": "16425957400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "55296106100": {"Name": "Georgantopoulos G.", "AuthorID": "55296106100", "AffiliationID": "60028900, 60067083", "AffiliationName": "First Department of Psychiatry, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "23102935900": {"Name": "Gonidakis F.", "AuthorID": "23102935900", "AffiliationID": "60028900, 60067083", "AffiliationName": "First Department of Psychiatry, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "56407192400": {"Name": "Stefanatou P.", "AuthorID": "56407192400", "AffiliationID": "60028900, 60067083", "AffiliationName": "First Department of Psychiatry, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "14052494200": {"Name": "Michopoulos I.", "AuthorID": "14052494200", "AffiliationID": "60028900, 60067083", "AffiliationName": "Second Department of Psychiatry, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "57208765987": {"Name": "David A.S.", "AuthorID": "57208765987", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Mental Health, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}}}
