We investigated associations between a comprehensive set of measures of macro and microvascular disease and depressive symptoms in older men and women. Methods: We performed cross-sectional analyses of the SABRE (Southall And Brent REvisited) population-based study. Participants (1396) attended clinic between 2008 and 2011 for assessment of subclinical macrovascular (carotid ultrasound, echocardiography, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging) and microvascular (retinopathy, nephropathy) disease, and depression. Results: Mean age of 1396 participants was 69.5 years, and 76.2% were male. The median (interquartile range) of depression score was 1 [0, 2] for men and 1 [0, 3] for women. All measures of subclinical macro and microvascular disease were adversely associated with depressive symptoms, even when known CVD was excluded. Physical activity partly explained some of these relationships. The association between left atrial dimension index (LADI), a measure of chronic elevated left ventricular filling pressure, and depressive symptoms was stronger in women (regression coefficient 0.23 [95% CI 0.11, 0.35]) than men (0.07 [-0.01, 0.15]), p for interaction 0.06, on multivariable adjustment. Conclusions: Subclinical macro and microvascular disease is associated with depressive symptoms, even in the absence of established CVD. These were in part accounted for by physical activity. We observed stronger association between LADI and depressive symptoms in women than in men. The beneficial role of physical activity in abrogating the association between subclinical CVD and depression warrants further investigation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Depression", "Epidemiology", "Risk factors", "Sex differences", "Vascular diseases"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091066344", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57194288913": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "57194288913", "AffiliationID": "60009860", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Medicine, School of Public Health, Fudan University"}, "8878251700": {"Name": "Tillin T.", "AuthorID": "8878251700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "57207789660": {"Name": "Hughes A.D.", "AuthorID": "57207789660", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "7402054647": {"Name": "Richards M.", "AuthorID": "7402054647", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "55618819600": {"Name": "Park C.", "AuthorID": "55618819600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "7005513520": {"Name": "Chaturvedi N.", "AuthorID": "7005513520", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "57217142957": {"Name": "Sattar N.", "AuthorID": "57217142957", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow"}}}
