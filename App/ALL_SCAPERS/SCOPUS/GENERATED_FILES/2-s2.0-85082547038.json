These include dementia, speech and swallowing problems, poor balance and falling. To date, there have been no agents which have yet had robust trial data to confirm positive effects at slowing down the neurodegenerative disease process of PD. In this chapter we will review the reasons why there is growing interest in drugs currently licensed for the treatment of diabetes as agents which may slow down disease progression in PD, including a review of the published trials regarding exenatide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist licensed to treat type 2 diabetes, and recently shown to be associated with reduced severity of PD in a randomized, placebo controlled washout design trial of 60 patients treated for 48 weeks. This subject is now a major area of interest for multiple pharmaceutical companies hoping to bring GLP-1 receptor agonists forward as treatment options in PD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diabetes", "Glucagon-like peptide 1", "Parkinson's disease"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Drug Repositioning", "Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor", "Humans", "Hypoglycemic Agents", "Parkinson Disease"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082547038", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"57215196433": {"Name": "Foltynie T.", "AuthorID": "57215196433", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "53063245900": {"Name": "Athauda D.", "AuthorID": "53063245900", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
