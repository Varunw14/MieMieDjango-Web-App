Conducting these multifaceted analyses on human samples is often complicated by the fact that the raw sequencing output is rarely available under open access. The Personal Genome Project UK (PGP-UK) is one of few resources that recruits its participants under open consent and makes the resulting multi-omics data freely and openly available. As part of this resource, we describe the PGP-UK multi-omics reference panel consisting of ten genomic, methylomic and transcriptomic data. Specifically, we outline the data processing, quality control and validation procedures which were implemented to ensure data integrity and exclude sample mix-ups. In addition, we provide a REST API to facilitate the download of the entire PGP-UK dataset. The data are also available from two cloud-based environments, providing platforms for free integrated analysis. In conclusion, the genotype-validated PGP-UK multi-omics human reference panel described here provides a valuable new open access resource for integrated analyses in support of personal and medical genomics.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Access to Information", "Genome, Human", "Genomics", "Humans", "Transcriptome", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074375007", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"], ["Library and Information Sciences", "SOCI", "3309"]], "AuthorData": {"55884829700": {"Name": "Chervova O.", "AuthorID": "55884829700", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "8695482400": {"Name": "Conde L.", "AuthorID": "8695482400", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "36026665000": {"Name": "Guerra-Assun\u00e7\u00e3o J.A.", "AuthorID": "36026665000", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57188684966": {"Name": "Moghul I.", "AuthorID": "57188684966", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "56689271800": {"Name": "Webster A.P.", "AuthorID": "56689271800", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57204930626": {"Name": "Berner A.", "AuthorID": "57204930626", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57211532585": {"Name": "Larose Cadieux E.", "AuthorID": "57211532585", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "The Francis Crick Institute"}, "57201212829": {"Name": "Tian Y.", "AuthorID": "57201212829", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "23477304600": {"Name": "Herrero J.", "AuthorID": "23477304600", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57193033325": {"Name": "Beck S.", "AuthorID": "57193033325", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57211533053": {"Name": "Voloshin V.", "AuthorID": "57211533053", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Warwick"}, "57211521532": {"Name": "Jesus T.F.", "AuthorID": "57211521532", "AffiliationID": "123389812", "AffiliationName": "Lifebit Biotech Ltd."}, "7003699541": {"Name": "Hamoudi R.", "AuthorID": "7003699541", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}}}
