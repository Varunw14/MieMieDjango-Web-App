Methods: Depressive symptoms at ages 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 years were defined as a child- or parent-completed Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ) score \u226511 (range 0\u201326). SMFQ score was also analysed as a continuous exposure. Chronic disabling fatigue at 16 was defined as fatigue of \u22656 months' but <5 years\u2019 duration which prevented school attendance or activities, for which other causes were not identified, and with a Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire score \u226519. Logistic regression was used with multiple imputation to correct for missing data bias. We performed sensitivity analyses in which children who had CDF and depressive symptoms at age 16 were reclassified as not having CDF. Results: In fully adjusted models using imputed data (N = 13,978), depressive symptoms at ages 9, 11, and 13 years were associated with 2- to 3-fold higher odds of CDF at age 16. Each one-point increase in SMFQ score at ages 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 years was associated with 6\u201311% higher odds of CDF at age 16. Depressive symptoms and continuous SMFQ scores at each age were not associated with CDF if the outcome was reclassified to exclude children with comorbid depressive symptoms at age 16. Conclusions: Depressive symptoms at ages 9\u201313 were associated with chronic disabling fatigue at age 16, but causality is not certain.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adolescence", "ALSPAC", "CFS/ME", "Chronic fatigue", "Mood", "Pediatric"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Case-Control Studies", "Causality", "Child", "Depression", "Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071708009", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7102643108": {"Name": "Collin S.M.", "AuthorID": "7102643108", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60186273", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Academic Child Health, University of Bristol"}, "15759465700": {"Name": "Joinson C.", "AuthorID": "15759465700", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60186273", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Academic Child Health, University of Bristol"}, "36343766500": {"Name": "Loades M.E.", "AuthorID": "36343766500", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Bath"}, "23033550500": {"Name": "Crawley E.", "AuthorID": "23033550500", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60186273", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Academic Child Health, University of Bristol"}, "55930436300": {"Name": "Norris T.", "AuthorID": "55930436300", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University"}, "7402636448": {"Name": "Lewis G.", "AuthorID": "7402636448", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "55666438900": {"Name": "Stansfeld S.A.", "AuthorID": "55666438900", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}}}
