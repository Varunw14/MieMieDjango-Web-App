Background: AS-amyloid affects 1 in 7 elderly patients referred for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Bone scintigraphy with exclusion of a plasma cell dyscrasia can diagnose transthyretin-related cardiac amyloid noninvasively, for which novel treatments are emerging. Amyloid interstitial expansion increases the myocardial extracellular volume (ECV). Methods: Patients with severe AS underwent bone scintigraphy (Perugini grade 0, negative; Perugini grades 1 to 3, increasingly positive) and routine TAVR evaluation CT imaging with ECVCT using 3- and 5-min post-contrast acquisitions. Twenty non-AS control patients also had ECVCT performed using the 5-min post-contrast acquisition. Results: A total of 109 patients (43% male; mean age 86 \u00b1 5 years) with severe AS and 20 control subjects were recruited. Sixteen (15%) had AS-amyloid on bone scintigraphy (grade 1, n = 5; grade 2, n = 11). ECVCT was 32 \u00b1 3%, 34 \u00b1 4%, and 43 \u00b1 6% in Perugini grades 0, 1, and 2, respectively (p < 0.001 for trend) with control subjects lower than lone AS (28 \u00b1 2%; p < 0.001). ECVCT accuracy for AS-amyloid detection versus lone AS was 0.87 (0.95 for 99mTc-3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid Perugini grade 2 only), outperforming conventional electrocardiogram and echocardiography parameters. One composite parameter, the voltage/mass ratio, had utility (similar AUC of 0.87 for any cardiac amyloid detection), although in one-third of patients, this could not be calculated due to bundle branch block or ventricular paced rhythm. Conclusions: ECVCT during routine CT TAVR evaluation can reliably detect AS-amyloid, and the measured ECVCT tracks the degree of infiltration. Another measure of interstitial expansion, the voltage/mass ratio, also performed well.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aortic stenosis", "cardiac amyloidosis", "computed tomography", "extracellular volume"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090013558", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57190858743": {"Name": "Scully P.R.", "AuthorID": "57190858743", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}, "55900197900": {"Name": "Patel K.P.", "AuthorID": "55900197900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}, "55680970600": {"Name": "Saberwal B.", "AuthorID": "55680970600", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St. Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "57196035427": {"Name": "Augusto J.B.", "AuthorID": "57196035427", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}, "57204675230": {"Name": "Thornton G.D.", "AuthorID": "57204675230", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St. Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "57205582129": {"Name": "Hughes R.K.", "AuthorID": "57205582129", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}, "6504025861": {"Name": "Manisty C.", "AuthorID": "6504025861", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}, "55645073800": {"Name": "Lloyd G.", "AuthorID": "55645073800", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7004749998": {"Name": "Kennon S.", "AuthorID": "7004749998", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St. Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "6507229201": {"Name": "Ozkor M.", "AuthorID": "6507229201", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St. Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "7006007287": {"Name": "Mullen M.", "AuthorID": "7006007287", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St. Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "24335636100": {"Name": "Menezes L.J.", "AuthorID": "24335636100", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "NIHR University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre"}, "15754511800": {"Name": "Treibel T.A.", "AuthorID": "15754511800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}, "57202314649": {"Name": "Moon J.C.", "AuthorID": "57202314649", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}, "8894702000": {"Name": "Pugliese F.", "AuthorID": "8894702000", "AffiliationID": "112843578", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Barts Biomedical Research Centre"}, "19735582900": {"Name": "Klotz E.", "AuthorID": "19735582900", "AffiliationID": "60028673", "AffiliationName": "Siemens Healthineers"}, "25030986400": {"Name": "Newton J.D.", "AuthorID": "25030986400", "AffiliationID": "60008323, 60170323", "AffiliationName": "John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford University Hospitals"}, "35515172500": {"Name": "Sabharwal N.", "AuthorID": "35515172500", "AffiliationID": "60008323, 60170323", "AffiliationName": "John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford University Hospitals"}, "6701789662": {"Name": "Kelion A.", "AuthorID": "6701789662", "AffiliationID": "60008323, 60170323", "AffiliationName": "John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford University Hospitals"}, "57201435946": {"Name": "Hartman N.", "AuthorID": "57201435946", "AffiliationID": "125045714", "AffiliationName": "Nuclear Medicine, Swansea Bay UHB"}, "56353423700": {"Name": "Cavalcante J.L.", "AuthorID": "56353423700", "AffiliationID": "60020051", "AffiliationName": "Minneapolis Heart Institute"}, "35464959200": {"Name": "Hawkins P.N.", "AuthorID": "35464959200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London"}}}
