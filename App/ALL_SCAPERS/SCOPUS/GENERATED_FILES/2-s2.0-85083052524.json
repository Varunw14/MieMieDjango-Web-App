In comparison, the incorporation of social network ideas into international business (IB) research remains more limited. The purpose of this special issue is to foster further research on social networks in IB. In our introductory essay, we provide a brief overview of network research in the IB domain to give a sense of some of the major ongoing themes and to illustrate how the social network approach can provide fresh insights and add substantive value to the field. To emphasize the considerable potential of using social network theories and ideas to advance research and understanding in IB, we also indicate some future directions. We follow these with a summary of the five articles in the special issue.", "AuthorKeywords": ["inter-location ties", "inter-organizational ties", "inter-personal ties", "literature review", "multinational firms", "network analysis", "network theory", "social networks", "subsidiary\u2013HQ relationships"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083052524", "SubjectAreas": [["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"16479828000": {"Name": "Cuypers I.R.P.", "AuthorID": "16479828000", "AffiliationID": "60018933", "AffiliationName": "Lee Kong Chian School of Business, Singapore Management University"}, "27367746700": {"Name": "Ertug G.", "AuthorID": "27367746700", "AffiliationID": "60018933", "AffiliationName": "Lee Kong Chian School of Business, Singapore Management University"}, "55916533900": {"Name": "Cantwell J.", "AuthorID": "55916533900", "AffiliationID": "60119141, 60112574", "AffiliationName": "Rutgers Business School, Rutgers University"}, "7005928191": {"Name": "Zaheer A.", "AuthorID": "7005928191", "AffiliationID": "60123802, 60029445", "AffiliationName": "Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota"}, "6603562680": {"Name": "Kilduff M.", "AuthorID": "6603562680", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Management, University College London"}}}
