We sought to assess fracture history and BMD in women with Turner syndrome (TS) and premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). Design: A cross-sectional observational study. Patients: Two hundred and sixty seven women with TS (median age 34.3 years) and 67 women with POI (median age 28.1 years). Measurements: A questionnaire was used to collect data on fracture history, co-morbidities and drug history including age at first oestrogen exposure. Clinical data included height, weight, serum vitamin D and hip and spine T-scores, which were adjusted for height and age. Fractures were subdivided into major osteoporotic fractures (MOF) and \u2018other\u2019 fracture types. Results: Overall fracture rate was similar in women with TS and POI (82 [30.5%] vs 22 [32.8%] respectively, P =.74). Compared to women with POI, those with TS had more fractures at MOF sites (30.2% vs 52.7%, P =.012) and fewer phalangeal fractures (27.9% vs 9.8%, P =.005). There was no difference in BMD between women who sustained a fracture compared to those who did not. Women with TS who fractured were more likely to suffer from hearing impairment compared to those with no fracture (62.2% vs 48.1%, P =.045). Conclusions: TS is not associated with an overall excess risk of bone fracture. The higher rate of fractures at MOF sites in women with TS may be secondary to hearing impairment, thin cortical bone and abnormal bone remodelling.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bone fractures", "bone mineral density", "hearing impairment", "oestrogen", "osteoporotic fractures", "premature ovarian insufficiency", "Turner syndrome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Bone Density", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Osteoporotic Fractures", "Primary Ovarian Insufficiency", "Risk Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Turner Syndrome", "Vitamin D", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074775047", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"57194479754": {"Name": "Cardona Attard C.", "AuthorID": "57194479754", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Reproductive Medicine Unit, University College London Hospitals"}, "57196187080": {"Name": "Cameron-Pimblett A.", "AuthorID": "57196187080", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Reproductive Medicine Unit, University College London Hospitals"}, "57211664408": {"Name": "Puri D.", "AuthorID": "57211664408", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Reproductive Medicine Unit, University College London Hospitals"}, "57211665338": {"Name": "Elliot J.", "AuthorID": "57211665338", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Reproductive Medicine Unit, University College London Hospitals"}, "57211666885": {"Name": "Wilson J.C.", "AuthorID": "57211666885", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Reproductive Medicine Unit, University College London Hospitals"}, "32868104400": {"Name": "Talaulikar V.S.", "AuthorID": "32868104400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Reproductive Medicine Unit, University College London Hospitals"}, "7404207971": {"Name": "Davies M.C.", "AuthorID": "7404207971", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Reproductive Medicine Unit, University College London Hospitals"}, "35475924300": {"Name": "Conway G.S.", "AuthorID": "35475924300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Reproductive Medicine Unit, University College London Hospitals"}}}
