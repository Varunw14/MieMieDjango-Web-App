Materials and methods: 15 healthy subjects (M/F: 9/6; age: 21\u201362) were scanned at 3T targeting the sciatic nerve at the thigh bilaterally, using a dual echo variable echo time (vTE) sequence (based on a spoiled gradient echo acquisition) with echo times of 0.98/5.37 ms. Apparent T2* (aT2*) values of the sciatic nerves were calculated with a mono-exponential fit and used for data comparison. Results: There were no significant differences in aT2* related to side, sex, age, and BMI, even though small differences for side were reported. Good-to-excellent repeatability and reproducibility were found for geometry of ROIs (Dice indices: intra-rater 0.68\u20130.7; inter-rater 0.70\u20130.72) and the related aT2* measures (intra-inter reader ICC 0.95\u20130.97; 0.66\u20130.85) from two different operators. Side-related signal-to-noise-ratio non-significant differences were reported, while contrast-to-noise-ratio measures were excellent both for side and echo. Discussion: Our study introduces a novel MR sequence sensitive to the short T2* components of the sciatic nerve and may be used for the study of peripheral nerve disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fibrosis", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Peripheral nerves", "Validation study"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091296623", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"55747638200": {"Name": "Felisaz P.F.", "AuthorID": "55747638200", "AffiliationID": "60073797", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Desio Hospital, ASST Monza"}, "57219114445": {"Name": "Belatti E.", "AuthorID": "57219114445", "AffiliationID": "60083543", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroradiology, IRCCS Mondino Foundation"}, "57198795054": {"Name": "Paoletti M.", "AuthorID": "57198795054", "AffiliationID": "60083543", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroradiology, IRCCS Mondino Foundation"}, "57219110181": {"Name": "Solazzo F.", "AuthorID": "57219110181", "AffiliationID": "60083543", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroradiology, IRCCS Mondino Foundation"}, "26641803100": {"Name": "Germani G.", "AuthorID": "26641803100", "AffiliationID": "60083543", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroradiology, IRCCS Mondino Foundation"}, "7006402583": {"Name": "Bastianello S.", "AuthorID": "7006402583", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain and Behavioral Sciences, University of Pavia"}, "6603006986": {"Name": "Pichiecchio A.", "AuthorID": "6603006986", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain and Behavioral Sciences, University of Pavia"}, "54791957000": {"Name": "Deligianni X.", "AuthorID": "54791957000", "AffiliationID": "60023588", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Basel"}, "35171347400": {"Name": "Santini F.", "AuthorID": "35171347400", "AffiliationID": "60023588", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Basel"}, "8840544500": {"Name": "Bieri O.", "AuthorID": "8840544500", "AffiliationID": "60023588", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Basel"}, "16311422200": {"Name": "Bergsland N.", "AuthorID": "16311422200", "AffiliationID": "60083100", "AffiliationName": "IRCCS, Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi"}, "57185293700": {"Name": "Cortese A.", "AuthorID": "57185293700", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department for Neuromuscular Disease, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology and The National Hospital for Neurology"}, "57194173440": {"Name": "Vegezzi E.", "AuthorID": "57194173440", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain and Behavioral Sciences, University of Pavia"}}}
