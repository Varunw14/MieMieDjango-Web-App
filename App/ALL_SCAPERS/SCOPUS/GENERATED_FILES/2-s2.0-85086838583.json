In this paper, we argue that those conducting social research in the energy domain should give special consideration to the internal and external validity of their work conducted during this pandemic period. We set out a number of principles that researchers can consider to give themselves and research users greater confidence that findings and recommendations will still be applicable in years to come. Largely grounded in existing good practice guidance, our recommendations include collecting and reporting additional supporting contextual data, reviewing aspects of research design for vulnerability to validity challenges, and building in longitudinal elements where feasible. We suggest that these approaches also bring a number of opportunities to generate new insights. However, we caution that a more systemic challenge to validity of knowledge produced during this period may result from changes in the kinds of social research that it is practicable to pursue.", "AuthorKeywords": ["COVID-19", "Energy", "Social science", "Validity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086838583", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Nuclear Energy and Engineering", "ENER", "2104"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"]], "AuthorData": {"55901208400": {"Name": "Fell M.J.", "AuthorID": "55901208400", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute, University College London"}, "57194468790": {"Name": "Pagel L.", "AuthorID": "57194468790", "AffiliationID": "60004718", "AffiliationName": "Swiss Center for Affective Sciences, University of Geneva"}, "48861129000": {"Name": "Chen C.f.", "AuthorID": "48861129000", "AffiliationID": "60138915", "AffiliationName": "Center for Ultra-wide-area Resilient Electrical Energy Transmission Networks (CURENT), University of Tennessee"}, "57205587316": {"Name": "Goldberg M.H.", "AuthorID": "57205587316", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, Yale University"}, "57209320705": {"Name": "Herberz M.", "AuthorID": "57209320705", "AffiliationID": "60004718", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Swiss Center for Affective Sciences, University of Geneva"}, "55058817700": {"Name": "Hahnel U.J.J.", "AuthorID": "55058817700", "AffiliationID": "60004718", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Swiss Center for Affective Sciences, University of Geneva"}, "55839916800": {"Name": "Huebner G.M.", "AuthorID": "55839916800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute and Institute for Environmental Design & Engineering, University College London"}, "57191255227": {"Name": "Sareen S.", "AuthorID": "57191255227", "AffiliationID": "60029622", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography & Centre for Climate and Energy Transformation, University of Bergen"}}}
