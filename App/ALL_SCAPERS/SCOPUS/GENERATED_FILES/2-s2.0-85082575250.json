Focusing especially on the officers serving with the Psychological Warfare Division (PWD), I will demonstrate that field intelligence officers' stance towards German civilians was fluid and often ambiguous, with the encounter causing considerable distress to some of them. Their reports and correspondence further suggest that in this period, Germans readily professed knowledge of atrocities. But contrary to intelligence officers' expectations, they failed to accept any guilt or responsibility. Finally, I will argue that the very foundations and techniques of Western Allied psychological warfare may have reinforced and legitimised justification strategies that separated between real Nazis and everyone else. This was at odds with one of the central aims of Military Government, i.e. to inculcate a sense of culpability in Germans.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082575250", "SubjectAreas": [["History", "ARTS", "1202"]], "AuthorData": {"57201668502": {"Name": "Rauch S.", "AuthorID": "57201668502", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Advanced Studies"}}}
