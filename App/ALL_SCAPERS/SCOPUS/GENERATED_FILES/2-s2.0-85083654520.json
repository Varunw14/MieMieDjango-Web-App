Among these, F2-isoprostanes stand out as potential biomarkers for early prognostication, providing information on the magnitude of global oxidative injury after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). We performed a topical review searching PubMed and Scopus databases to identify studies evaluating the modifications of F2-isoprostanes in the early period after CA, and a meta-analysis of studies providing curves of F2-isoprostanes plasma levels seeking to describe the biomarker\u2019s kinetics after CA. Evidence suggests that plasma levels of F2-isoprostanes increase in the early post-resuscitation period and seem well correlated with the burden of ischaemia-reperfusion injury. Our meta-analysis shows a possible increase as early as 5 minutes after ROSC, which persists at 2 hours and is attenuated at 4 hours. Clinical studies are warranted to evaluate the utility of this biomarker for prognostication purposes in CA survivors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biomarkers", "Cardiac arrest", "emergency medicine", "F2-isoprostanes", "prognostication"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083654520", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis", "ENVI", "2307"]], "AuthorData": {"6507455327": {"Name": "Karlis G.", "AuthorID": "6507455327", "AffiliationID": "113894366", "AffiliationName": "Hellenic Society of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation"}, "19337989500": {"Name": "Xanthos T.", "AuthorID": "19337989500", "AffiliationID": "60104630", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, European University Cyprus"}, "6602469737": {"Name": "Kotanidou A.", "AuthorID": "6602469737", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "1stDepartment of Intensive Care Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "57188877741": {"Name": "Georgiopoulos G.", "AuthorID": "57188877741", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Therapeutics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "57210724180": {"Name": "Masi S.", "AuthorID": "57210724180", "AffiliationID": "60028868", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa"}, "57142426900": {"Name": "Magkas N.", "AuthorID": "57142426900", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "1stDepartment of Cardiology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}}}
