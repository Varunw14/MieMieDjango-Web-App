Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional, online survey of pediatric neurologists across the world affiliated with the International Child Neurology Association, the Chinese Child Neurology Society, the Child Neurology Society, and the Pediatric Epilepsy Research Consortium. Results were analyzed in relation to regional burden of COVID-19 disease. Results: From April 10 to 24, 2020, a sample of 212 respondents from 49 countries indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed many aspects of pediatric epilepsy care, with 91.5% reporting changes to outpatient care, 90.6% with reduced access to electroencephalography (EEG), 37.4% with altered management of infantile spasms, 92.3% with restrictions in ketogenic diet initiation, 93.4% with closed or severely limited epilepsy monitoring units, and 91.3% with canceled or limited epilepsy surgery. Telehealth use had increased, with 24.7% seeing patients exclusively via telehealth. Changes in practice were related both to COVID-19 burden and location. Conclusions: In response to COVID-19, pediatric epilepsy programs have implemented crisis standards of care that include increased telemedicine, decreased EEG use, changes in treatments of infantile spasms, and cessation of epilepsy surgery. The long-term impact of these abrupt changes merit careful study.", "AuthorKeywords": ["epilepsy", "epilepsy surgery", "infantile spasms", "telemedicine"], "IndexKeywords": ["Betacoronavirus", "Child", "Coronavirus Infections", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Delivery of Health Care", "Electroencephalography", "Epilepsy", "Global Health", "Health Care Surveys", "Humans", "Internationality", "Neurologists", "Neurology", "Pandemics", "Pediatricians", "Pediatrics", "Pneumonia, Viral", "Telemedicine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087970998", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"6603731456": {"Name": "Wirrell E.C.", "AuthorID": "6603731456", "AffiliationID": "60005558", "AffiliationName": "Divisions of Child and Adolescent Neurology and Epilepsy, Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic"}, "36967058100": {"Name": "Grinspan Z.M.", "AuthorID": "36967058100", "AffiliationID": "60007997", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Population Sciences and Pediatrics, Weill Cornell Medicine"}, "14008449200": {"Name": "Knupp K.G.", "AuthorID": "14008449200", "AffiliationID": "60028392", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics and Neurology, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"}, "7404833361": {"Name": "Jiang Y.", "AuthorID": "7404833361", "AffiliationID": "60121971", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Peking University First Hospital"}, "57218123507": {"Name": "Hammeed B.", "AuthorID": "57218123507", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Neurosciences, Great Ormond Street Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "8749975300": {"Name": "Mytinger J.R.", "AuthorID": "8749975300", "AffiliationID": "60003500, 60080012", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Neurology, Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital, The Ohio State University"}, "55449651100": {"Name": "Patel A.D.", "AuthorID": "55449651100", "AffiliationID": "60003500, 60080012", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Neurology, Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital, The Ohio State University"}, "6701756441": {"Name": "Nabbout R.", "AuthorID": "6701756441", "AffiliationID": "60123804, 60123796, 60026877", "AffiliationName": "Centre de Reference Epilepsies Rares, Department of Pediatric Neurology, Necker Enfants Malades Hospital, Imagine Institute, Paris Descartes University"}, "6603496267": {"Name": "Specchio N.", "AuthorID": "6603496267", "AffiliationID": "60017905", "AffiliationName": "Rare and Complex Epilepsy Unit, Department of Neuroscience, Bambino Gesu\u2019 Children\u2019s Hospital, IRCCS"}, "56347087500": {"Name": "Cross J.H.", "AuthorID": "56347087500", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neurosciences, UCL NIHR BRC Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "14424512300": {"Name": "Shellhaas R.A.", "AuthorID": "14424512300", "AffiliationID": "60007200, 60025778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics (Pediatric Neurology), Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan"}}}
