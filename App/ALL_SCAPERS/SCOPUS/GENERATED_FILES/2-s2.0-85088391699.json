In T cells, PI3K\u03b1 and PI3K\u03b4 are activated by the TCR and costimulatory receptors, whereas PI3K\u03b3 is activated by G protein-coupled chemokine receptors. PI3K\u03b4 is a key regulator of regulatory T (Treg) cell function. PI3K isoform-selective inhibitors are in development for the treatment of diseases associated with immune dysregulation, including chronic inflammatory conditions, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. Idelalisib (PI3K\u03b4), alpelisib (PI3K\u03b1), duvelisib (PI3K\u03b4/\u03b3), and copanlisib (pan-PI3K) have recently been approved for use in cancer treatment. Although effective, these therapies often have severe side effects associated with immune dysregulation and, in particular, loss of Treg cells. Therefore, it is important to gain a better understanding of the relative contribution of different PI3K isoforms under homeostatic and inflammatory conditions. Experimental autoimmune encephalitis is a mouse model of T cell-driven CNS inflammation, in which Treg cells play a key protective role. In this study, we show that PI3K\u03b4 is required to maintain normal Treg cell development and phenotype under homeostatic conditions but that loss of PI3K\u03b4 alone in Treg cells does not lead to autoimmunity. However, combined loss of PI3K\u03b1 and PI3K\u03b4 signaling resulted in increased experimental autoimmune encephalitis disease severity. Moreover, mice lacking PI3K\u03b1 and PI3K\u03b4 in Treg cells developed spontaneous peripheral nerve inflammation. These results show a key role for PI3K signaling in Treg cell-mediated protection against CNS inflammation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088391699", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"56471301700": {"Name": "Stark A.K.", "AuthorID": "56471301700", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge"}, "57218225083": {"Name": "Davenport E.C.M.", "AuthorID": "57218225083", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge"}, "14830373800": {"Name": "Patton D.T.", "AuthorID": "14830373800", "AffiliationID": "107019532", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Lymphocyte Signalling and Development, Babraham Research Campus"}, "8323789000": {"Name": "Veldhoen M.", "AuthorID": "8323789000", "AffiliationID": "60021283, 60021696, 60106051", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Joa\u00f4 Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"}, "6603546433": {"Name": "Okkenhaug K.", "AuthorID": "6603546433", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge"}, "57213660208": {"Name": "Scudamore C.L.", "AuthorID": "57213660208", "AffiliationID": "124834214", "AffiliationName": "Exepathology"}, "7006432340": {"Name": "Garden O.A.", "AuthorID": "7006432340", "AffiliationID": "60006297", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Sciences and Advanced Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania"}, "7004331309": {"Name": "Vanhaesebroeck B.", "AuthorID": "7004331309", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}}}
