It also examines the role of childhood intelligence and education on these trajectories and group membership. Participants were drawn from the Lothian Birth Cohort of 1921 (LBC1921), a longitudinal study of individuals with a mean age of 79 years at study entry, and observed up to a maximum of five times to their early 90s. Growth mixture modeling was employed to identify groups of individuals with similar trajectories of global cognitive function measured with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in relation to time to death, accounting for childhood intelligence, education, the time to death from study entry, and health conditions (hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease). Two distinct groups of individuals (classes) were identified: a smaller class (18% of the sample) of individuals whose MMSE scores dropped linearly with about 0.5 MMSE points per year closer to death and a larger group (82% of the sample) with stable MMSE across the study period. Only childhood intelligence was found to be associated with an increased probability of belonging to the stable class of cognitive functioning prior to death (odds ratio = 1.08, standard error = 0.02, p \u2264.001). These findings support a protective role of childhood intelligence, a marker of cognitive reserve, against the loss of cognitive function prior to death. Our results also suggest that terminal decline is not necessarily a normative process.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Childhood intelligence", "Education", "Growth mixture models (GMM)", "MMSE", "Terminal decline"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Child", "Cognition", "Cognitive Reserve", "Education", "Female", "Health Status", "Humans", "Intelligence", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Mental Status and Dementia Tests"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087061432", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"57016564400": {"Name": "Cadar D.", "AuthorID": "57016564400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "24074784500": {"Name": "Robitaille A.", "AuthorID": "24074784500", "AffiliationID": "60027863", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Quebec"}, "6603830153": {"Name": "Pattie A.", "AuthorID": "6603830153", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Edinburgh"}, "57215886102": {"Name": "Deary I.J.", "AuthorID": "57215886102", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh"}, "35206359500": {"Name": "Muniz-Terrera G.", "AuthorID": "35206359500", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Dementia Prevention, University of Edinburgh"}}}
