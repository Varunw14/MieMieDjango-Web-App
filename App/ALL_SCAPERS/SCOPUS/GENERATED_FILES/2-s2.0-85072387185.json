Methods: The medical records of TED patients treated for strabismus from January 2005 to January 2016 were reviewed retrospectively for demographic and surgical data. The cross-sectional superior oblique area was compared to age-matched controls on high-resolution orbital computed tomography (CT) using a standardized protocol. Results: A total of 46 TED patients and 18 controls were included. The mean superior oblique cross-sectional area in TED subjects was 250% larger than in controls (22.88 \u00b1 6.64 mm2 vs 9.32 \u00b1 1.85 mm2. The mean cross-sectional area was >3 standard deviations from the mean of the control group in 96% of TED patients. Conclusions: Superior oblique enlargement in TED may occur more frequently than generally recognized, challenging the notion that TED is primarily a disease of the rectus muscles.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072387185", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"36491014100": {"Name": "del Porto L.", "AuthorID": "36491014100", "AffiliationID": "60019331", "AffiliationName": "The Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital"}, "57201465113": {"Name": "Hinds A.M.", "AuthorID": "57201465113", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "33368230100": {"Name": "Raoof N.", "AuthorID": "33368230100", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "12807018900": {"Name": "Davagnanam I.", "AuthorID": "12807018900", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "14039221400": {"Name": "Hancox J.", "AuthorID": "14039221400", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7401507242": {"Name": "Adams G.", "AuthorID": "7401507242", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College"}, "26530845600": {"Name": "Barras C.", "AuthorID": "26530845600", "AffiliationID": "60005245", "AffiliationName": "Radiology Department, Royal Melbourne Hospital"}}}
