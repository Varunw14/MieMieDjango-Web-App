Diversity of crop production over space and time reduces land use intensity and may mitigate impacts on biodiversity while contributing to growing demand for human food and nutrition resources. Crop species are also known to have independent impacts on biodiversity. To date, reviews synthesising our knowledge of crop species and crop diversity-biodiversity links are missing. We will therefore conduct a systematic review by searching multiple agriculture, ecology and environmental science databases (e.g. Web of Science, Geobase, Agris, AGRICOLA, GreenFILE) to identify studies reporting the impacts of crop diversity and crop species on the biological diversity of fauna, flora and microbes in agricultural landscapes. Outcomes will include metrics of species richness, abundance, assemblage, community composition and species rarity. Screening, data coding and data extraction will be carried out by one reviewer and a proportion will be independently conducted by a second reviewer. Study quality and risk of bias will be assessed. Evidence will first be mapped by species/taxa then assessed for further narrative or statistical synthesis based on comparability of results and likely robustness. Gaps in the evidence base will also be identified with a view toward future research and policy directions for nutrition, food systems and ecology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Abundance", "Agricultural management", "Biodiversity", "Crop diversity", "Crop rotation", "Intercropping", "Species richness"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078360888", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"57203243900": {"Name": "Moss C.", "AuthorID": "57203243900", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Centre on Climate Change and Planetary Health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}, "57193335370": {"Name": "Harris F.", "AuthorID": "57193335370", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Centre on Climate Change and Planetary Health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}, "35318886800": {"Name": "Scheelbeek P.", "AuthorID": "35318886800", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Centre on Climate Change and Planetary Health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}, "55214823600": {"Name": "Green R.", "AuthorID": "55214823600", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Centre on Climate Change and Planetary Health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}, "6603151894": {"Name": "Dangour A.", "AuthorID": "6603151894", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Centre on Climate Change and Planetary Health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}, "8081662900": {"Name": "Lukac M.", "AuthorID": "8081662900", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "School of Agriculture, Policy and Development, University of Reading"}, "56684876400": {"Name": "Outhwaite C.", "AuthorID": "56684876400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research, University College London"}}}
