Results of experimental measurements are used to calculate the Abraham model solute descriptors of 4-methyl-3-nitrobenzoic acid. The calculated Abraham model solute descriptors describe the observed solubility behaviour of 4-methyl-3-nitrobenzoic acid to within 0.05 log units.", "AuthorKeywords": ["4-Methyl-3-nitrobenzoic acid solubilities", "Abraham model", "organic mono-solvents", "solute descriptors"], "IndexKeywords": ["2-Ethyl-1-hexanol", "2-methyl-1-butanol", "Abraham model", "Acid solubility", "Diisopropyl ether", "Solute descriptors", "Spectroscopic method", "Tetra-hydrofuran"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071285286", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57205362830": {"Name": "Wang S.", "AuthorID": "57205362830", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57205362441": {"Name": "Liu K.", "AuthorID": "57205362441", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57205455866": {"Name": "Zhang A.", "AuthorID": "57205455866", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57209253627": {"Name": "Dai J.", "AuthorID": "57209253627", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57202917265": {"Name": "Gupta A.", "AuthorID": "57202917265", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57209263347": {"Name": "Zhu S.", "AuthorID": "57209263347", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57210724797": {"Name": "Eddula S.", "AuthorID": "57210724797", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57210731450": {"Name": "Jiang C.", "AuthorID": "57210731450", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "35496753700": {"Name": "Acree W.E.", "AuthorID": "35496753700", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "7202901240": {"Name": "Abraham M.H.", "AuthorID": "7202901240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
