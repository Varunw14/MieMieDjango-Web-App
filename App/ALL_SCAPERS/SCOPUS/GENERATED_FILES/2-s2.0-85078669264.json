KGaA, WeinheimNanoporous carbons (NPCs) with engineered specific pore sizes and sufficiently high porosities (both specific surface area and pore volume) are necessary for storing energy in the form of electric charges and molecules. Herein, NPCs, derived from biomass pine-cones, coffee-grounds, graphene-oxide and metal-organic frameworks, with systematically increased pore width (<1.0 nm to a few nm), micropore volume (0.2\u20130.9 cm3 g\u22121) and specific surface area (800\u20132800 m2 g\u22121) are presented. Superior CO2, H2, and H2O uptakes of 35.0 wt% (\u22487.9 mmol g\u22121 at 273 K), 3.0 wt% (at 77 K) and 85.0 wt% (at 298 K), respectively at 1 bar, are achieved. At controlled microporosity, supercapacitors deliver impressive performance with a capacity of 320 and 230 F g\u22121 at 500 mA g\u22121, in aqueous and organic electrolytes, respectively. Excellent areal capacitance and energy density (>50 Wh kg\u22121 at high power density, 1000 W kg\u22121) are achieved to form the highest reported values among the range of carbons in the literature. The noteworthy energy storage performance of the NPCs for all five cases (CO2, H2, H2O, and capacitance in aqueous and organic electrolytes) is highlighted by direct comparison to numerous existing porous solids. A further analysis on the specific pore type governed physisorption capacities is presented.", "AuthorKeywords": ["carbon-based electric-double-layer capacitors (EDLCs)", "carbon-dioxide capture", "high energy supercapacitors", "hydrogen storage", "nanoporous carbon and multifunctional activity", "water capture"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carbon dioxide capture", "Carbon-based", "High power density", "Metal organic framework", "Multifunctional activity", "Organic electrolyte", "Storage performance", "Water capture"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078669264", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"36664352000": {"Name": "Gadipelli S.", "AuthorID": "36664352000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57218389380": {"Name": "Zhang H.", "AuthorID": "57218389380", "AffiliationID": "60016521", "AffiliationName": "College of Physics, Sichuan University"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.R.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60172680", "AffiliationName": "The Faraday Institution, Quad One, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.J.L.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60172680", "AffiliationName": "The Faraday Institution, Quad One, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "7202774632": {"Name": "Howard C.A.", "AuthorID": "7202774632", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics & Astronomy, University College London"}, "7003890182": {"Name": "Skipper N.T.", "AuthorID": "7003890182", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics & Astronomy, University College London"}, "56456916900": {"Name": "Guo J.", "AuthorID": "56456916900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
