Excitation of the bright \u00cf\u00cf*-state of isoxazole predominantly leads to ring-opening dynamics. Both the initially excited \u00cf\u00cf*-state and the dissociative \u00cf\u03c3*-state offer a combined barrier-free reaction pathway, such that ring-opening, defined as a distance of more than 2 \u00c5 between two neighboring atoms, occurs within 45 fs. For oxazole, in contrast, the excited state dynamics is about twice as slow (85 fs) and the quantum yield for ring-opening is lower. This is caused by a small barrier between the \u00cf\u00cf*-state and the \u00cf\u03c3*-state along the reaction path, which suppresses direct ring-opening. Theoretical findings are consistent with the measured time-resolved photoelectron spectra, confirming the timescales and the quantum yields for the ring-opening channel. The results indicate that a combination of time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and excited state dynamics simulations can explain the dominant reaction pathways for this class of molecules. As a general rule, we suggest that the antibonding \u03c3*-orbital located between the oxygen atom and a neighboring atom of a five-membered heterocyclic system provides a driving force for ring-opening reactions, which is modified by the presence and position of additional nitrogen atoms.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Ab initio dynamics", "Excited state relaxation", "Excited-state dynamics", "Heterocyclic systems", "Photoelectron spectrum", "Ring opening reaction", "Ring-opening dynamics", "Time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085265150", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"56956526700": {"Name": "Geng T.", "AuthorID": "56956526700", "AffiliationID": "60065435, 60028378", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, AlbaNova University Centre, Stockholm University"}, "8245258200": {"Name": "Schalk O.", "AuthorID": "8245258200", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Copenhagen"}, "57220534079": {"Name": "Hansson T.", "AuthorID": "57220534079", "AffiliationID": "60065435, 60028378", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, AlbaNova University Centre, Stockholm University"}, "15038312900": {"Name": "Thomas R.D.", "AuthorID": "15038312900", "AffiliationID": "60065435, 60028378", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, AlbaNova University Centre, Stockholm University"}, "56986532000": {"Name": "Ehrmaier J.", "AuthorID": "56986532000", "AffiliationID": "60117644, 60019722", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Technical University of Munich"}, "23981006900": {"Name": "Richings G.W.", "AuthorID": "23981006900", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Centre for Scientific Computing, University of Warwick"}, "7006625328": {"Name": "Worth G.", "AuthorID": "7006625328", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
