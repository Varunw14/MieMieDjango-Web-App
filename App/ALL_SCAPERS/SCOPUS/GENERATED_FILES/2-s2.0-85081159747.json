EVs are nano-communication devices that influence cell, tissue, and organism behavior. Mechanisms driving ciliary EV biogenesis are almost entirely unknown. Here, we show that the ciliary G-protein Rab28, associated with human autosomal recessive cone-rod dystrophy, negatively regulates EV levels in the sensory organs of Caenorhabditis elegans in a cilia specific manner. Sequential targeting of lipidated Rab28 to periciliary and ciliary membranes is highly dependent on the BBSome and the prenyl-binding protein phosphodiesterase 6 subunit delta (PDE6D), respectively, and BBSome loss causes excessive and ectopic EV production. We also find that EV defective mutants display abnormalities in sensory compartment morphogenesis. Together, these findings reveal that Rab28 and the BBSome are key in vivo regulators of EV production at the periciliary membrane and suggest that EVs may mediate signaling between cilia and glia to shape sensory organ compartments. Our data also suggest that defects in the biogenesis of cilia-related EVs may contribute to human ciliopathies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081159747", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"36645718900": {"Name": "Akella J.S.", "AuthorID": "36645718900", "AffiliationID": "60120069, 60119141", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics and Human Genetics Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University"}, "55467629100": {"Name": "Silva M.", "AuthorID": "55467629100", "AffiliationID": "60025488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Utah"}, "57215559896": {"Name": "Rizvi F.", "AuthorID": "57215559896", "AffiliationID": "60120069, 60119141", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics and Human Genetics Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University"}, "7101606197": {"Name": "Barr M.M.", "AuthorID": "7101606197", "AffiliationID": "60120069, 60119141", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics and Human Genetics Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University"}, "57191526002": {"Name": "Carter S.P.", "AuthorID": "57191526002", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomolecular and Biomedical Science, Conway Institute, University College Dublin"}, "57215560202": {"Name": "Tsiropoulou S.", "AuthorID": "57215560202", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomolecular and Biomedical Science, Conway Institute, University College Dublin"}, "57212679609": {"Name": "Moran A.L.", "AuthorID": "57212679609", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomolecular and Biomedical Science, Conway Institute, University College Dublin"}, "55427388400": {"Name": "Kennedy B.N.", "AuthorID": "55427388400", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomolecular and Biomedical Science, Conway Institute, University College Dublin"}, "57201560247": {"Name": "Blacque O.E.", "AuthorID": "57201560247", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomolecular and Biomedical Science, Conway Institute, University College Dublin"}, "7202572513": {"Name": "Nguyen K.", "AuthorID": "7202572513", "AffiliationID": "60002388", "AffiliationName": "Center for C. elegans Anatomy, Albert Einstein College of Medicine"}, "7404434893": {"Name": "Hall D.H.", "AuthorID": "7404434893", "AffiliationID": "60002388", "AffiliationName": "Center for C. elegans Anatomy, Albert Einstein College of Medicine"}}}
