The device used the concept of paper-folding, or origami, to serve as a valve between sample introduction and detection, so reducing sampling volumes and improving operation convenience. Amino-functionalized graphene (NH2-GO)/thionine (THI)/gold particle (AuNP) nanocomposites were used to modify the working electrode not only to generate the electrochemical signals, but also to provide an environment conducive to aptamer immobilization. Electrochemical characterization revealed that the formation of an insulating aptamer\u2013antigen immunocomplex would hinder electron transfer from the sample medium to the working electrode, thus resulting in a lower signal. The experimental results showed that the proposed aptasensor exhibited a linear range from 0.05 to 200 ngmL\u22121 (R2 = 0.989) and a detection limit of 5 pgmL\u22121 for EGFR. The analytical reliability of the proposed paper-based aptasensor was further investigated by analyzing serum samples, showing good agreement with the gold-standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biorecognition elements", "Electrochemical characterizations", "ELectrochemical detection", "Electrochemical signals", "Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay", "Epidermal growth factor receptors", "Functionalized graphene", "Ultrasensitive detection"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084842500", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Materials Science (miscellaneous)", "MATE", "2501"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56594747000": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "56594747000", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "57208426378": {"Name": "Sun S.", "AuthorID": "57208426378", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "26867890300": {"Name": "Luo J.", "AuthorID": "26867890300", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "57212476880": {"Name": "Ming T.", "AuthorID": "57212476880", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "35206154400": {"Name": "Liu J.", "AuthorID": "35206154400", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "8514473600": {"Name": "Cai X.", "AuthorID": "8514473600", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "57188998186": {"Name": "Xiong Y.", "AuthorID": "57188998186", "AffiliationID": "60008510, 60124575", "AffiliationName": "Key laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Thoracic Surgery II, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute"}, "55687264100": {"Name": "Ma Y.", "AuthorID": "55687264100", "AffiliationID": "60008510, 60124575", "AffiliationName": "Key laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Thoracic Surgery II, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute"}, "36099693000": {"Name": "Yan S.", "AuthorID": "36099693000", "AffiliationID": "60008510, 60124575", "AffiliationName": "Key laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Thoracic Surgery II, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute"}, "7409381940": {"Name": "Yang Y.", "AuthorID": "7409381940", "AffiliationID": "60008510, 60124575", "AffiliationName": "Key laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Thoracic Surgery II, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute"}, "24330188600": {"Name": "Yang Z.", "AuthorID": "24330188600", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, James Watt School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "25825387900": {"Name": "Reboud J.", "AuthorID": "25825387900", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, James Watt School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "7403113927": {"Name": "Yin H.", "AuthorID": "7403113927", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, James Watt School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "55154841200": {"Name": "Cooper J.M.", "AuthorID": "55154841200", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, James Watt School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}}}
