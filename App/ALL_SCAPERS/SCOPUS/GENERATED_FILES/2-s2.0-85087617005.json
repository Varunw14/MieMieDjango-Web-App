Objective: We explored cross-sectional associations between coffee consumption and physical performance among oldest-old community-dwelling men in the Helsinki Businessmen Study (HBS). Methods: A random sample of HBS survivors (n = 126, mean age 87 years) attended a clinic visit in 2017/2018, including measurements of body composition, physical performance [Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)], and cognition. Coffee consumption was retrieved from 3-day food diaries. Results: Coffee consumption was positively associated with higher gait speed (p = 0.003), SPPB score (p = 0.035), and chair rise points (p = 0.043). Association of coffee with gait speed remained after adjustment for age, waist circumference, physical activity, pulse rate, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Conclusion: Higher coffee consumption was independently associated with better physical performance reflected as faster gait speed in oldest-old men.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Appendicular lean mass", "Coffee", "Gait speed", "Oldest-old men", "Physical performance"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087617005", "SubjectAreas": [["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"15078004700": {"Name": "Jyv\u00e4korpi S.K.", "AuthorID": "15078004700", "AffiliationID": "60016987, 60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Clinicum and Helsinki University Hospital, University of Helsinki"}, "57200531800": {"Name": "Urtamo A.", "AuthorID": "57200531800", "AffiliationID": "60016987, 60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Clinicum and Helsinki University Hospital, University of Helsinki"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivim\u00e4ki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60016987, 60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Clinicum and Helsinki University Hospital, University of Helsinki"}, "57202566229": {"Name": "Strandberg T.E.", "AuthorID": "57202566229", "AffiliationID": "60012954", "AffiliationName": "Center for Life Course Health Research, University of Oulu"}}}
