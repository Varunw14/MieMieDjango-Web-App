Echocardiography is the first-line examination for patients presenting with heart failure, and it is the imaging modality that most often raises the suspicion of cardiac amyloidosis. Echocardiography can provide an assessment of the likelihood of cardiac amyloid infiltration versus other hypertrophic phenocopies and can assess the severity of cardiac involvement. Visualizing myocardial amyloid infiltration is challenging and, until recently, was restricted to the domain of the pathologist. Two tests are transforming this: cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and bone scintigraphy. After the administration of contrast, CMR is highly sensitive and specific for the 2 main types of ventricular myocardial amyloidosis, light chain amyloidosis (AL) and transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR). CMR structural and functional assessment combined with tissue characterization can redefine cardiac involvement by tracking different disease processes, ranging from amyloid infiltration, to the myocardial response associated with amyloid deposition, through the visualization and quantification of myocardial edema and myocyte response. Bone scintigraphy (paired with exclusion of serum free light chains) is emerging as the technique of choice for distinguishing ATTR from light chain cardiac amyloidosis and other cardiomyopathies; it has transformed the diagnostic pathway for ATTR, allowing noninvasive diagnosis of ATTR without the need for a tissue biopsy in the majority of patients. CMR with tissue characterization and bone scintigraphy are rewriting disease understanding, classification, and definition, and leading to a change in patient care.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cardiac amyloidosis", "cardiac imaging", "light chain amyloidosis", "transthyretin amyloidosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amyloid Neuropathies, Familial", "Cardiomyopathies", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Extracellular Space", "Fibrosis", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin Light-chain Amyloidosis", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Myocardium", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Radionuclide Imaging", "Reproducibility of Results", "Ventricular Remodeling"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073964475", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"16306839900": {"Name": "Fontana M.", "AuthorID": "16306839900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}, "57190958650": {"Name": "\u0106orovi\u0107 A.", "AuthorID": "57190958650", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "57190858743": {"Name": "Scully P.", "AuthorID": "57190858743", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St. Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "57202314649": {"Name": "Moon J.C.", "AuthorID": "57202314649", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St. Bartholomew's Hospital"}}}
