Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.An ambition of healthcare policy has been to move more acute services into community settings. This systematic literature review presents analysis of published operational research methods for modelling patient flow within community healthcare, and for modelling the combination of patient flow and outcomes in all settings. Assessed for inclusion at three levels\u2013with the references from included papers also assessed\u201325 \u201cPatient flow within community care\u201d, 23 \u201cPatient flow and outcomes\u201d papers and 5 papers within the intersection are included for review. Comparisons are made between each paper\u2019s setting, definition of states, factors considered to influence flow, output measures and implementation of results. Common complexities and characteristics of community service models are discussed with directions for future work suggested. We found that in developing patient flow models for community services that use outcomes, transplant waiting list may have transferable benefits.", "AuthorKeywords": ["community healthcare", "Literature review", "operational research", "outcomes", "patient flow"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075679675", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"57206198076": {"Name": "Palmer R.", "AuthorID": "57206198076", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Operational Research Unit, Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "57201081414": {"Name": "Utley M.", "AuthorID": "57201081414", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Operational Research Unit, Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "7003777671": {"Name": "Fulop N.J.", "AuthorID": "7003777671", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}}}
