The filtered Navier\u2013Stokes equations are discretised using the finite volume method with the PISO algorithm for velocity-pressure coupling and the dynamic Smagorinsky subgrid-scale model is employed to compute the effect of the unresolved (subgrid) scales of turbulence on the large scales. In the present study, the small cut-cells are unmodified and due to the use of an implicit time integration no instabilities occur during the computations. The versatility and robustness of the present two-phase flow model is illustrated via various two- and three-dimensional flow problems with fixed/moving bodies, such as dambreak flows with and without a square cylinder, a moving cylinder in a quiescent fluid, dambreak flow over a wet bed with a moving gate, water entry and exist of a circular cylinder, and landside-generated waves. Good agreement is obtained between the numerical results and the corresponding experimental measurements.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cartesian cut-cell method", "Finite volume method", "Moving bodies", "Two-phase flow", "Volume-of-fluid method"], "IndexKeywords": ["Air water interfaces", "Cartesian cut cell method", "Implicit time integration", "Smagorinsky subgrid scale model", "Three-dimensional flow", "Two phase flow model", "Velocity-pressure coupling", "Volume of fluid method"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084637915", "SubjectAreas": [["Numerical Analysis", "MATH", "2612"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"16235608000": {"Name": "Xie Z.", "AuthorID": "16235608000", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, Cardiff University"}, "6507316700": {"Name": "Stoesser T.", "AuthorID": "6507316700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
