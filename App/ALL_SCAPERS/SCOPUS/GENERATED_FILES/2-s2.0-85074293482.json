Although the phylogeny of this family has been investigated multiple times, its position among other teleost groups remains ambiguous. Most studies have used a single or few genes to decipher the phylogenetic relationships of sparids. Here, we conducted a thorough phylogenomic analysis using five recently available Sparidae gene-sets and 26 high-quality, genome-predicted teleost proteomes. Our analysis suggested that Tetraodontiformes (puffer fish, sunfish) are the closest relatives to sparids than all other groups used. By analytically comparing this result to our own previous contradicting finding, we show that this discordance is not due to different orthology assignment algorithms; on the contrary, we prove that it is caused by the increased taxon sampling of the present study, outlining the great importance of this aspect in phylogenomic analyses in general.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Animals", "Databases, Genetic", "Perciformes", "Phylogeny", "Proteome", "Transcriptome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074293482", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"]], "AuthorData": {"57211514674": {"Name": "Natsidis P.", "AuthorID": "57211514674", "AffiliationID": "60012413, 60001524", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, University of Crete"}, "56319718900": {"Name": "Tsakogiannis A.", "AuthorID": "56319718900", "AffiliationID": "60003230", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Marine Biology, Biotechnology and Aquaculture, Hellenic Centre for Marine Research"}, "6602312643": {"Name": "Tsigenopoulos C.S.", "AuthorID": "6602312643", "AffiliationID": "60003230", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Marine Biology, Biotechnology and Aquaculture, Hellenic Centre for Marine Research"}, "51663867800": {"Name": "Manousaki T.", "AuthorID": "51663867800", "AffiliationID": "60003230", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Marine Biology, Biotechnology and Aquaculture, Hellenic Centre for Marine Research"}, "24537512800": {"Name": "Pavlidis P.", "AuthorID": "24537512800", "AffiliationID": "60035865, 60019181", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Computer Science, Foundation for Research and Technology"}}}
