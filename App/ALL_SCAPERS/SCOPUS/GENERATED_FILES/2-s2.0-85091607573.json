We consider the theoretical and methodological resources that social semiotics has developed to account for multimodal text in the contemporary semiotic landscape, and explore how they can be used to teach critical reading skills to young people to support their participation in different social domains. We reflect on the possibilities and limitations of different analytical frameworks, highlighting barriers and possibilities for advancing social semiotic scholarship on reading and beyond. We end with a sketch of a new research agenda for social semiotics, in the light of technological change and its implications for reading.", "AuthorKeywords": ["image", "Multimodality", "reading", "social media", "social semiotics"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091607573", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Life-span and Life-course Studies", "SOCI", "3319"]], "AuthorData": {"16506294300": {"Name": "Bezemer J.", "AuthorID": "16506294300", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "57215013308": {"Name": "Cowan K.", "AuthorID": "57215013308", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}}}
