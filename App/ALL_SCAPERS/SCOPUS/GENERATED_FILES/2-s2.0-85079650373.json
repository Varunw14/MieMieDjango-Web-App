Despite high heritability, there is a paucity of identified genetic risk factors. Immune biomarkers are under more direct genetic influence than bipolar disorder. To explore the genetic associations with immune biomarker levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood serum which previously showed differences in bipolar disorder, we performed a study involving 291 individuals (184 bipolar disorder patients and 107 controls). The biomarkers assayed in both CSF and serum were: chitinase-3-like protein-1 (YKL-40), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), soluble cluster of differentiation (sCD14), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 and 2 (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2). C-reactive protein (CRP) was only quantified in serum, and interleukin 8 (IL-8) measures were only available in CSF. Genome-wide association studies were conducted using PLINK for each of three genotyping waves and incorporated covariates for population substructure, age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). Results were combined by meta-analysis. Genome-wide significant associations were detected for all biomarkers except TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 in CSF. The strongest association in CSF was found for markers within the CNTNAP5 gene with YKL-40 (rs150248456, P = 2.84 \u00d7 10\u221210). The strongest association in serum was also for YKL-40 but localized to the FANCI gene (rs188263039, P = 5.80 \u00d7 10\u221226). This study revealed numerous biologically plausible genetic associations with immune biomarkers in CSF and blood serum. Importantly, the genetic variants regulating immune biomarker levels in CSF and blood serum differ. These results extend our knowledge of how biomarkers showing alterations in bipolar disorder are genetically regulated.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079650373", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"57214993947": {"Name": "Zhang R.", "AuthorID": "57214993947", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet"}, "56313191800": {"Name": "Song J.", "AuthorID": "56313191800", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet"}, "8780535400": {"Name": "Bergen S.E.", "AuthorID": "8780535400", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet"}, "7004259279": {"Name": "Land\u00e9n M.", "AuthorID": "7004259279", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, the Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg"}, "53877274400": {"Name": "Isgren A.", "AuthorID": "53877274400", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, the Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg"}, "55508135900": {"Name": "Jakobsson J.", "AuthorID": "55508135900", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, the Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg"}, "7101909602": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "7101909602", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "57208899083": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "57208899083", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL"}, "37020689800": {"Name": "Sellgren C.M.", "AuthorID": "37020689800", "AffiliationID": "60019295, 60012311, 60017615", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Psychiatry Research, Karolinska Institutet, & Stockholm Health Care Services, Stockholm County Council, Karolinska University Hospital"}}}
