Different CBT delivery formats (face-to-face [F2F], multimedia, and hybrid) and intensities have been used to expand access to the treatment. The aim of this study is to estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of different CBT delivery modes. Methods: A decision-analytic model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different CBT delivery modes and variations in intensity in comparison with treatment as usual (TAU). The model covered an average treatment period of 4 months with a 5-year follow-up period. The model was populated using a systematic review of randomized controlled trials and various sources from the literature. Results: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of treatments compared with the next best option after excluding all the dominated and extended dominated options are: \u00a3209/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for 6 (sessions) \u00d7 30 (minutes) F2F-CBT versus TAU; \u00a34 453/QALY for 8 \u00d7 30 F2F versus 6 \u00d7 30 F2F; \u00a312 216/QALY for 8 \u00d7 60 F2F versus 8 \u00d7 30 F2F; and \u00a343 072/QALY for 16 \u00d7 60 F2F versus 8 \u00d7 60 F2F. The treatment with the highest net monetary benefit for thresholds of \u00a320 000 to \u00a330 000/QALY was 8 \u00d7 30 F2F-CBT. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis illustrated 6 \u00d7 30 F2F-CBT had the highest probability (32.8%) of being cost-effective at \u00a320 000/QALY; 16 \u00d7 60 F2F-CBT had the highest probability (31.0%) at \u00a330 000/QALY. Conclusions: All CBT delivery modes on top of TAU were found to be more cost-effective than TAU alone. Four F2F-CBT options (6 \u00d7 30, 8 \u00d7 30, 8 \u00d7 60, 16 \u00d7 60) are on the cost-effectiveness frontier. F2F-CBT with intensities of 6 \u00d7 30 and 16 \u00d7 60 had the highest probabilities of being cost-effective. The results, however, should be interpreted with caution owing to the high level of uncertainty.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cognitive behavioral therapy", "cost-effectiveness", "decision-analytic model", "depression"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091713259", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"55780178700": {"Name": "Wu Q.", "AuthorID": "55780178700", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of York"}, "56580778500": {"Name": "Li J.", "AuthorID": "56580778500", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of York"}, "8342965100": {"Name": "Parrott S.", "AuthorID": "8342965100", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of York"}, "57202999333": {"Name": "L\u00f3pez-L\u00f3pez J.A.", "AuthorID": "57202999333", "AffiliationID": "60000130", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic Psychology & Methodology, University of Murcia"}, "56717123200": {"Name": "Davies S.R.", "AuthorID": "56717123200", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School for Policy Studies, University of Bristol"}, "8961655400": {"Name": "Caldwell D.M.", "AuthorID": "8961655400", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "57211284405": {"Name": "Peters T.J.", "AuthorID": "57211284405", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "57194055799": {"Name": "Dawson S.", "AuthorID": "57194055799", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "9337815800": {"Name": "Welton N.J.", "AuthorID": "9337815800", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "57202420867": {"Name": "Churchill R.C.", "AuthorID": "57202420867", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, University of York"}, "7402636448": {"Name": "Lewis G.", "AuthorID": "7402636448", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "6701845780": {"Name": "Tallon D.", "AuthorID": "6701845780", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Academic Mental Health, Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "57199266735": {"Name": "Taylor A.", "AuthorID": "57199266735", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Academic Mental Health, Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "36798567100": {"Name": "Kessler D.S.", "AuthorID": "36798567100", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Academic Mental Health, Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "6602536089": {"Name": "Wiles N.", "AuthorID": "6602536089", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Academic Mental Health, Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}}}
