Methods: Outcome data were collected for all vitrectomised patients who had undergone Artisan IOL insertion between January 2014 and May 2019 at Moorfields Eye Hospital. All those with follow-up greater than 2 months were included in the analysis. Results: Sixty-nine eyes from 61 patients were included. Average follow up was 2 years. Fifty-five (80%) eyes had at least one ocular comorbidity prior to Artisan IOL insertion. At final follow up 46 (67%) eyes had best-corrected VA better than 6/12. Sixty-three eyes (91%) either gained or maintained VA. Mean post-operative spherical equivalent was \u22120.2D. Two (3%) lenses became de-enclavated requiring further surgery. Two (3%) eyes developed acute post-operative cystoid macular oedema. Two (3%) required additional topical IOP-lowering therapy to their pre-operative glaucoma regimen. One eye had mild corneal oedema, which persisted for 1 year following surgery and subsequently resolved. Conclusions: Artisan IOL insertion is a safe and effective option for the surgical correction of aphakia in vitrectomised eyes lacking capsular support. Refractive results comparable to posterior chamber IOL placement can be achieved with these lenses.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086563733", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"]], "AuthorData": {"55297894600": {"Name": "Negretti G.S.", "AuthorID": "55297894600", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Vitreoretinal Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "25026976000": {"Name": "Chan W.O.", "AuthorID": "25026976000", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Vitreoretinal Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "57203157173": {"Name": "Muqit M.M.K.", "AuthorID": "57203157173", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Vitreoretinal Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}}}
