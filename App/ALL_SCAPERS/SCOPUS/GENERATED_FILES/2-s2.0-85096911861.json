The early detection of new vessels may be challenging and often requires the use of invasive tests such as fundus fluorescein angiography (FA). We demonstrate the use of wide-field optical coherence tomography angiography (WF-OCTA) in the detection and characterization of neovascularization secondary to ischemic RVO. Subjects/methods: We conducted a retrospective observational case series of patients diagnosed with ischemic RVO between August 2018 and March 2019, who underwent WF-SS-OCTA imaging (PLEX Elite 9000, Carl Zeiss Meditec). We performed real-life montage imaging, covering the involved area and compared the findings of WF-SS-OCTA to standard clinical examination and when available, ultrawide-field fluorescein angiography (UWF-FA, Optos 200TX). Results: In the included 39 eyes with ischemic RVO, neovascularization elsewhere (NVE) was encountered in 16 of 39 eyes (41%) on WF-OCTA and were characterized as sea-fan type vessels and nodular type vessels, based on their appearance and localization. NVE was identified in 4/39 eyes on standard clinical examination, equating to a detection rate of 10.3%. All were of a sea-fan morphology. In one case, NVE found on WF-OCTA was not observed on UWF-FA, which was a nodular type. Neovascularization of the disc (NVD) was detected in one eye. Conclusions: WF-OCTA may become a useful noninvasive tool in the detection of neovascularization in patients with ischemic RVO. Furthermore, the characterization of different morphologies of neovascularization detected by WF-OCTA could be of clinical relevance.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096911861", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"]], "AuthorData": {"57210111140": {"Name": "Huemer J.", "AuthorID": "57210111140", "AffiliationID": "60008824", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Institute for Research in Ocular Surgery, A Karl Landsteiner Institute, Hanusch Hospital"}, "57196260132": {"Name": "Khalid H.", "AuthorID": "57196260132", "AffiliationID": "60011568", "AffiliationName": "Ophthalmology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University"}, "57209035230": {"Name": "Wagner S.K.", "AuthorID": "57209035230", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "36128742800": {"Name": "Nicholson L.", "AuthorID": "36128742800", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57209181179": {"Name": "Fu D.J.", "AuthorID": "57209181179", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "22958698000": {"Name": "Sim D.A.", "AuthorID": "22958698000", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7401717575": {"Name": "Patel P.J.", "AuthorID": "7401717575", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "35221042600": {"Name": "Balaskas K.", "AuthorID": "35221042600", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "8417872600": {"Name": "Rajendram R.", "AuthorID": "8417872600", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "24480921100": {"Name": "Keane P.A.", "AuthorID": "24480921100", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
