The annual event brings together researchers, biocurators and software engineers to present recent results and discuss future work in the area of standards for systems and synthetic biology. The COMBINE initiative coordinates the development of various community standards and formats for computational models in the life sciences. Over the past 10 years, COMBINE has brought together standard communities that have further developed and harmonized their standards for better interoperability of models and data. COMBINE 2019 was co-located with a stakeholder workshop of the European EU-STANDS4PM initiative that aims at harmonized data and model standardization for in silico models in the field of personalized medicine, as well as with the FAIRDOM PALs meeting to discuss findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) data sharing. This report briefly describes the work discussed in invited and contributed talks as well as during breakout sessions. It also highlights recent advancements in data, model, and annotation standardization efforts. Finally, this report concludes with some challenges and opportunities that this community will face during the next 10 years.", "AuthorKeywords": ["COMBINE", "community building", "meeting report", "standardization"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089809895", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"36471561200": {"Name": "Waltemath D.", "AuthorID": "36471561200", "AffiliationID": "60082844", "AffiliationName": "Medical Informatics, Greifswald"}, "57218617966": {"Name": "Inau E.T.", "AuthorID": "57218617966", "AffiliationID": "60082844", "AffiliationName": "Medical Informatics, Greifswald"}, "16229843100": {"Name": "Golebiewski M.", "AuthorID": "16229843100", "AffiliationID": "60113322", "AffiliationName": "Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies (HITS)"}, "14056059900": {"Name": "Krebs O.", "AuthorID": "14056059900", "AffiliationID": "60113322", "AffiliationName": "Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies (HITS)"}, "6603347010": {"Name": "Wittig U.", "AuthorID": "6603347010", "AffiliationID": "60113322", "AffiliationName": "Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies (HITS)"}, "7005588702": {"Name": "Blinov M.L.", "AuthorID": "7005588702", "AffiliationID": "60000209", "AffiliationName": "UConn Health, CT"}, "16202455700": {"Name": "Gleeson P.", "AuthorID": "16202455700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "6701613156": {"Name": "Hermjakob H.", "AuthorID": "6701613156", "AffiliationID": "60026124", "AffiliationName": "EMBL-EBI"}, "56695257000": {"Name": "Malik-Sheriff R.S.", "AuthorID": "56695257000", "AffiliationID": "60026124", "AffiliationName": "EMBL-EBI"}, "57201972868": {"Name": "Hucka M.", "AuthorID": "57201972868", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": null}, "27171824900": {"Name": "Keating S.M.", "AuthorID": "27171824900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7101762732": {"Name": "K\u00f6nig M.", "AuthorID": "7101762732", "AffiliationID": "60000762", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Theoretical Biology, Humboldt-University Berlin"}, "7005755956": {"Name": "Nickerson D.", "AuthorID": "7005755956", "AffiliationID": "60112777, 60005686", "AffiliationName": "Auckland Bioengineering Institute, University of Auckland"}, "26023519300": {"Name": "Oberortner E.", "AuthorID": "26023519300", "AffiliationID": "60014567, 60007174", "AffiliationName": null}, "6601968571": {"Name": "Sauro H.M.", "AuthorID": "6601968571", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": null}, "15832747700": {"Name": "Smith L.", "AuthorID": "15832747700", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": null}, "7102481723": {"Name": "Schreiber F.", "AuthorID": "7102481723", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": null}, "24554347800": {"Name": "Stefan M.I.", "AuthorID": "24554347800", "AffiliationID": "60025488", "AffiliationName": "University of Utah, UT"}, "7202313819": {"Name": "Myers C.J.", "AuthorID": "7202313819", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}}}
