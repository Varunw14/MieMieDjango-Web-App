Methods: Feed additions were conductedatfixedvolumesorlinkedto amarkersuchascellgrowthormetabolismandaddedasbolusornear-continuously using the automated feeding moduleofthemicro-Matrix(Applikon). Results:Theselectedfeedingregimens supported maximum viable cell densitiesofupto1.9\u00d7107cellsml\u22121and finaltitersofupto1.13gl\u22121.Differences in growth and titer between feeding strategies were insignificant, with the exception of one feeding strategy. Conclusion: As the more complex feeding strategies did not create an advantage, the selection of a simple feeding strategy such as bolus or continuous addition of feed medium is preferred.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Automation", "Downscale", "Fed-batch", "GS-CHO cells", "Miniature shaken bioreactor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Automation", "Batch Cell Culture Techniques", "Cell Proliferation", "Cells, Cultured", "CHO Cells", "Cricetulus", "Culture Media"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075563535", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"57201730848": {"Name": "Wiegmann V.", "AuthorID": "57201730848", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57211982810": {"Name": "Giaka M.", "AuthorID": "57211982810", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "6603502108": {"Name": "Baganz F.", "AuthorID": "6603502108", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57201724372": {"Name": "Martinez C.B.", "AuthorID": "57201724372", "AffiliationID": "124353069", "AffiliationName": "Applikon-Biotechnology BV, Heertjeslaan"}}}
