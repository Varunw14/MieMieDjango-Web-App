The SBSs are empowered by edge clouds offering limited computing services for UEs, whereas the MBS provides high-performance central cloud computing services to UEs via a restricted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) backhaul to their associated SBSs. With processing latency constraints at the central and the edge networks, we aim to minimize the system energy consumption used for task offloading and computation. The problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the cloud selection, the UEs' transmit powers, the SBSs' receive beamformers, and the SBSs' transmit covariance matrices, which is a mixed-integer and non-convex optimization problem. Based on the methods such as decomposition approach and successive pseudoconvex approach, a tractable solution is proposed via an iterative algorithm. The simulation results show that our proposed solution can achieve great performance gain over conventional schemes using edge or central cloud alone. Also, with large-scale antennas at the MBS, the massive MIMO backhaul can significantly reduce the complexity of the proposed algorithm and obtain even better performance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["backhaul", "central cloud computing", "Edge computing", "HetNets", "massive MIMO"], "IndexKeywords": ["backhaul", "Cloud computing services", "Decomposition approach", "Heterogeneous cellular networks", "Hetnets", "High energy efficiency", "Nonconvex optimization", "System energy consumption"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079809772", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"55496280500": {"Name": "Hu X.", "AuthorID": "55496280500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7404759940": {"Name": "Wong K.K.", "AuthorID": "7404759940", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56072896600": {"Name": "Wang L.", "AuthorID": "56072896600", "AffiliationID": "60009860, 60025278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Fudan University"}, "7103288466": {"Name": "Tao M.", "AuthorID": "7103288466", "AffiliationID": "60025084, 60025278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "56532695100": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "56532695100", "AffiliationID": "121400464", "AffiliationName": "Kuang-Chi Institute of Advanced Technology"}, "57189902299": {"Name": "Zheng Z.", "AuthorID": "57189902299", "AffiliationID": "117991180", "AffiliationName": "East China Institute of Telecommunications, China Academy of Information and Communications Technology"}}}
