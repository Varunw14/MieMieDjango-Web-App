This article aims to contribute to this worthwhile endeavour to develop a consensual HRE curriculum model by identifying four issues with Parker\u2019s proposition. While Parker argues the prevalence of constructivism impeded the development of an HRE, the author argues that the negative implications of constructivism for traditional subjects are not true for HRE. After expanding on the other two issues, Sen notes empirical evidence from an HRE textbook, in use in Turkey, to support his fourth point that what is key to a powerful HRE is political support. The article ends with a call to the HRE community to contemplate political impediments that risk making HRE an ineffective enterprise at schools.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Council of Europe", "Human rights education", "powerful knowledge", "social realism", "Turkey"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088190376", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"57201281229": {"Name": "Sen A.", "AuthorID": "57201281229", "AffiliationID": "60029016", "AffiliationName": "College of Education, Eskisehir Osmangazi University"}}}
