The advent of the World Health Organisation's Short Course regimen for MDR-TB, which halves treatment duration, has transformed outcomes and treatment acceptability for affected patients. Bedaquiline, a cornerstone of the Short Course regimen, has unknown teratogenicity and the WHO therefore recommends reliable contraception for all female MDR-TB patients in order to secure eligibility for bedaquiline. We were concerned that low contraceptive uptake among female patients in our rural South African MDR-TB treatment programme could jeopardise their access to bedaquiline. We therefore conducted a service delivery improvement project that aimed to audit contraceptive use in female MDR-TB patients, integrate family planning services into MDR-TB care, and increase the proportion of female patients eligible for bedaquiline therapy. Methods Contraceptive use and pregnancy rates were audited in all female patients aged 13-50 years initiated on our MDR-TB treatment programme in 2016. We then implemented an intervention consisting of procurement of depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) for the MDR-TB unit and training of specialist MDR-TB nurses in administration of DMPA. The audit cycle was repeated for all female patients aged 13-50 years initiated on the programme in January-October 2017 (post-intervention). Results The proportion of women on injectable contraceptives by the time of MDR-TB treatment initiation increased significantly in the post-intervention cohort (77.4% vs 23.9%, p<0.0001). Conclusion By integrating contraceptive services into our MDR-TB programme we significantly increased contraceptive uptake, protecting women from the obstetric risks associated with pregnancy during MDR-TB treatment and maximising their eligibility for bedaquiline therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["family planning service delivery", "HIV", "hormonal contraception", "long-acting reversible contraception", "multidrug-resistant tuberculosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Antitubercular Agents", "Contraception", "Family Planning Services", "Female", "Health Services Accessibility", "Humans", "Isoniazid", "Middle Aged", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Rate", "Rifampin", "Rural Population", "South Africa", "Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075806887", "SubjectAreas": [["Reproductive Medicine", "MEDI", "2743"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"57212049128": {"Name": "Cornish E.F.", "AuthorID": "57212049128", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "57212049066": {"Name": "Hudson J.", "AuthorID": "57212049066", "AffiliationID": "101443686", "AffiliationName": "Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) Programme, Estcourt Hospital"}, "56673785500": {"Name": "Sayers R.", "AuthorID": "56673785500", "AffiliationID": "101443686", "AffiliationName": "Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) Programme, Estcourt Hospital"}, "24767764300": {"Name": "Loveday M.", "AuthorID": "24767764300", "AffiliationID": "60094841, 60017135", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa, Nelson R Mandela School of Medicine"}}}
