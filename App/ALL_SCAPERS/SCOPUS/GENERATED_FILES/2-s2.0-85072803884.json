Clinical mentoring programs help to develop students\u2019 clinical skills and can increase interest in under-subscribed specialties. Those that focus on teaching professionalism are integrated into medical school curriculums in order to overcome the \u201chidden curriculum\u201d. Positive mentoring plays a part in reversing the decline of academic medicine, by sparking interest through early research experiences. It also has an important role in encouraging recruitment of under-represented minority groups into the medical profession through widening access programs. The aim of our review of the literature, is to analyze current trends in medical student mentoring programs, taking into account their objectives, execution, and evaluation. We outline the challenges encountered, potential benefits, and key future implications for mentees, mentors, and institutions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Delivery", "Design", "Evaluation", "Medical education", "Mentee", "Mentor"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072803884", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"56695096000": {"Name": "Nimmons D.", "AuthorID": "56695096000", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL Medical School, Royal Free Campus"}, "7202963229": {"Name": "Rosenthal J.", "AuthorID": "7202963229", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL Medical School, Royal Free Campus"}, "57021732500": {"Name": "Giny S.", "AuthorID": "57021732500", "AffiliationID": "60028760", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Royal Surrey County Hospital"}}}
