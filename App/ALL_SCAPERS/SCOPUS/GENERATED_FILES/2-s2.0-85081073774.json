Case description: This report describes a 12-year-old boy with short stature, visual impairment, and developmental delay who presented with macroscopic hematuria and albuminuria. He had isolated growth hormone deficiency, optic nerve hypoplasia, and a small anterior pituitary with corpus callosum dysgenesis on his cranial magnetic resonance imaging, thereby supporting a diagnosis of optic nerve hypoplasia syndrome. Renal histopathology revealed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Using next-generation sequencing on a targeted gene panel for steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, compound heterozygous missense mutations were identified in LAMB2 (c.737G>A p.Arg246Gln, c.3982G>C p.Gly1328Arg). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed reduced glomerular laminin \u03b22 expression compared to control kidney and a thin basement membrane on electron microscopy. Laminin \u03b22 is expressed during pituitary development and Lamb2-/- mice exhibit stunted growth, abnormal neural retinae, and here we show, abnormal parenchyma of the anterior pituitary gland. Conclusion: We propose that patients with genetically undefined optic nerve hypoplasia syndrome should be screened for albuminuria and, if present, screened for mutations in LAMB2.", "AuthorKeywords": ["LAMB2", "optic nerve hypoplasia syndrome", "Pierson syndrome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Albuminuria", "Child", "Humans", "Hypopituitarism", "Laminin", "Male", "Mutation", "Optic Nerve Hypoplasia", "Phenotype"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081073774", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Biochemistry (medical)", "MEDI", "2704"]], "AuthorData": {"57200542942": {"Name": "Tahoun M.", "AuthorID": "57200542942", "AffiliationID": "60033041", "AffiliationName": "Clinical and Chemical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University"}, "16224323200": {"Name": "Marzouk S.", "AuthorID": "16224323200", "AffiliationID": "60033041", "AffiliationName": "Clinical and Chemical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University"}, "55145308100": {"Name": "Saied M.H.", "AuthorID": "55145308100", "AffiliationID": "60033041", "AffiliationName": "Clinical and Chemical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University"}, "56623966200": {"Name": "Chandler J.C.", "AuthorID": "56623966200", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London, Programme of Developmental Biology of Birth Defects"}, "56746333600": {"Name": "Haston S.", "AuthorID": "56746333600", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London, Programme of Developmental Biology of Birth Defects"}, "57215530474": {"Name": "Kim J.S.", "AuthorID": "57215530474", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London, Programme of Developmental Biology of Birth Defects"}, "7003534902": {"Name": "Dattani M.T.", "AuthorID": "7003534902", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24170359900": {"Name": "Waters A.M.", "AuthorID": "24170359900", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8644251700": {"Name": "Ashton E.", "AuthorID": "8644251700", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57215531042": {"Name": "Hannan A.", "AuthorID": "57215531042", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55520827500": {"Name": "D'arco F.", "AuthorID": "55520827500", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6602980434": {"Name": "Bockenhauer D.", "AuthorID": "6602980434", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57215528987": {"Name": "Anderson G.", "AuthorID": "57215528987", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7404816314": {"Name": "Lin M.H.", "AuthorID": "7404816314", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "7102332722": {"Name": "Miner J.H.", "AuthorID": "7102332722", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine"}}}
