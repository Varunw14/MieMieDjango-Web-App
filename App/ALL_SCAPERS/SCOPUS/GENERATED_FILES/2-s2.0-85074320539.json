In this study, an extended model utilizing the geometric dimensions of the heart chambers was developed to describe the cardiac function. The new cardiac model was evaluated by simulating a healthy and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) condition for adults and children. The left ventricular ejection fraction, end-diastolic volume, end-diastolic diameter and diastolic sphericity index were 53.60%, 125 mL, 5.08 cm and 1.82 in the healthy adult cardiovascular system model and 23.70%, 173 mL, 6.60 cm and 1.40 in the DCM adult cardiovascular system model. In the healthy child cardiovascular system model, the left ventricular ejection fraction, end-diastolic volume, end-diastolic diameter and diastolic sphericity index were 59.70%, 92 mL, 4.10 cm and 2.26 respectively and 30.70%, 125 mL, 4.94 cm and 1.87 in the DCM child cardiovascular system model. The developed cardiovascular system model simulates the hemodynamic variables and clinical diagnostic indicators within the physiological range for healthy and DCM conditions proving the feasibility of this new model to evaluate clinical cases in adults and children.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cardiomyopathy, Dilated", "Child", "Diastole", "Female", "Heart", "Heart Failure", "Heart Function Tests", "Hemodynamics", "Humans", "Male", "Models, Theoretical", "Stroke Volume", "Ventricular Dysfunction, Left", "Ventricular Function, Left"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074320539", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"35100053600": {"Name": "Bozkurt S.", "AuthorID": "35100053600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}}}
