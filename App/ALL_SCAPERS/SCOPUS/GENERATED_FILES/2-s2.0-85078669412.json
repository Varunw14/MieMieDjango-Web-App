Method: Secondary analysis of data from a cross-sectional survey. Using a stratified sampling design, 545 pregnant women were recruited. Diagnostic interviews were administered to assess lifetime and current ED, depression, anxiety, and borderline personality disorder. Data were extracted from maternity records to assess identification of ED in antenatal care. Estimates of population prevalence of ED were obtained using sampling weights to account for the stratified sampling design. Results: Weighted prevalence of lifetime ED was 15.35% (95% confidence interval [CI] [11.80, 19.71]), and current ED was 1.47% (95% CI [0.64, 3.35]). Depression, anxiety, and history of deliberate self-harm or attempted suicide were common in pregnant women with ED. Identification of ED in antenatal care was low. Conclusions: Findings indicate that by early pregnancy, a significant proportion of pregnant women will have had ED, although less typically during pregnancy, and psychiatric comorbidity is common. Yet ED were poorly recognised in antenatal care. The findings highlight the importance of increasing awareness about maternal ED to improve identification and response to the healthcare needs of pregnant women with ED.", "AuthorKeywords": ["eating disorders", "epidemiology", "pregnancy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Feeding and Eating Disorders", "Female", "Humans", "Pregnancy", "Pregnant Women", "Prevalence", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078669412", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55623960200": {"Name": "Bye A.", "AuthorID": "55623960200", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice Research and Teaching Department, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57002424600": {"Name": "Nath S.", "AuthorID": "57002424600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Section of Women's Mental Health, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7202645145": {"Name": "Howard L.M.", "AuthorID": "7202645145", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "16031429800": {"Name": "Micali N.", "AuthorID": "16031429800", "AffiliationID": "60004718", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Gynaecology and Obstetrics, University of Geneva"}, "55939975400": {"Name": "Ryan E.G.", "AuthorID": "55939975400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Biostatistics and Health Informatics Department, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "55859601200": {"Name": "Bick D.", "AuthorID": "55859601200", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women and Children's Health, School of Life Course Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London"}, "24586935300": {"Name": "Easter A.", "AuthorID": "24586935300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Implementation Science, Health Service and Population Research, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London"}}}
