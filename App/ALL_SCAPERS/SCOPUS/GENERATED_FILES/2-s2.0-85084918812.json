By exploiting squared position error bound as the localization metric, the problem is formulated into a mixed boolean second order cone programming, and is then solved by binary particle swarm optimization. Finally, the proposed algorithm is validated by numerical simulations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anchor deployment", "binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO)", "Indoor positioning", "power allocation", "second-order cone programming (SOCP)", "squared position error bound (SPEB)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Binary particle swarm optimization", "Joint optimization", "Localization errors", "Network localization", "Optimization based methods", "Position errors", "Power allocations", "Second-order cone programming"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084918812", "SubjectAreas": [["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57190985239": {"Name": "Ma Z.", "AuthorID": "57190985239", "AffiliationID": "60016835", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Millimeter Wave and Terahertz Techniques, School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology"}, "57189321740": {"Name": "Qiao H.", "AuthorID": "57189321740", "AffiliationID": "60016835", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Millimeter Wave and Terahertz Techniques, School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology"}, "57209736802": {"Name": "Liu S.", "AuthorID": "57209736802", "AffiliationID": "60016835", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Millimeter Wave and Terahertz Techniques, School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology"}, "13007707000": {"Name": "Lv X.", "AuthorID": "13007707000", "AffiliationID": "60016835", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Millimeter Wave and Terahertz Techniques, School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology"}, "57211818673": {"Name": "Liu F.", "AuthorID": "57211818673", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
