This study examines 122 rape cases involving young adult and adult male victims reported to the London Metropolitan Police Service between 2005 and 2012. Overall, there were a number of similarities with cases involving female victims; however, male cases were more likely to involve strangers, substance use, and a victim with mental health issues, alluding to specific vulnerabilities. Moreover, younger victims, victims with poor mental health, and victims who had consumed alcohol or drugs were less likely to have their cases referred to prosecutors and more likely to be \u2018no-crimed\u2019 by police. This paper provides unique insight into the profile and trajectories of male-on-male rape cases, and preliminary recommendations for both police practice and future research are provided.", "AuthorKeywords": ["attrition", "male rape", "policing", "Rape", "rape myths"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096168495", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"55697984000": {"Name": "Hine B.A.", "AuthorID": "55697984000", "AffiliationID": "60004814", "AffiliationName": "School of Human and Social Sciences, University of West London"}, "57219943684": {"Name": "Widanaralalage Don B.K.S.", "AuthorID": "57219943684", "AffiliationID": "60004814", "AffiliationName": "School of Human and Social Sciences, University of West London"}, "57219942297": {"Name": "Murphy A.D.", "AuthorID": "57219942297", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Birmingham"}, "54893765200": {"Name": "Yesberg J.A.", "AuthorID": "54893765200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department for Security and Crime Science, University College London"}, "57219940925": {"Name": "Wunsch D.", "AuthorID": "57219940925", "AffiliationID": "112936391", "AffiliationName": "Evidence and Insight team, Mayor\u2019s Office for Policing and Crime"}, "57219938208": {"Name": "Charleton B.", "AuthorID": "57219938208", "AffiliationID": "112936391", "AffiliationName": "Evidence and Insight team, Mayor\u2019s Office for Policing and Crime"}}}
