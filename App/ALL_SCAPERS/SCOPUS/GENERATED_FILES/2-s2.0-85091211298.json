American Journal of Transplantation published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant SurgeonsIslet transplantation is an effective therapy for life-threatening hypoglycemia, but graft function gradually declines over time in many recipients. We characterized islet-specific T cells in recipients within an islet transplant program favoring alemtuzumab (ATZ) lymphodepleting induction and examined associations with graft function. Fifty-eight recipients were studied: 23 pretransplant and 40 posttransplant (including 5 with pretransplant phenotyping). The proportion with islet-specific T cell responses was not significantly different over time (pre-Tx: 59%; 1\u20136 m posttransplant: 38%; 7\u201312 m: 44%; 13\u201324 m: 47%; and >24 m: 45%). However, phenotype shifted significantly, with IFN-\u03b3\u2013dominated response in the pretransplant group replaced by IL-10\u2013dominated response in the 1\u20136 m posttransplant group, reverting to predominantly IFN-\u03b3\u2013oriented response in the >24 m group. Clustering analysis of posttransplant responses revealed two main agglomerations, characterized by IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 phenotypes, respectively. IL-10\u2013oriented posttransplant response was associated with relatively low graft function. Recipients within the IL-10+ cluster had a significant decline in C-peptide levels in the period preceding the IL-10 response, but stable graft function following the response. In contrast, an IFN-\u03b3 response was associated with subsequently decreased C-peptide. Islet transplantation favoring ATZ induction is associated with an initial altered islet-specific T cell phenotype but reversion toward pretransplant profiles over time. Posttransplant autoreactive T cell phenotype may be a predictor of subsequent graft function.", "AuthorKeywords": ["autoantibody", "basic (laboratory) research/science", "clinical research/practice", "immunobiology", "islet transplantation", "islets of Langerhans", "monitoring: immune", "T cell biology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091211298", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"25652188500": {"Name": "Sabbah S.", "AuthorID": "25652188500", "AffiliationID": "60005518, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust and King\u2019s College London"}, "57202607904": {"Name": "Kundu R.", "AuthorID": "57202607904", "AffiliationID": "60005518, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust and King\u2019s College London"}, "57206292773": {"Name": "Reading J.L.", "AuthorID": "57206292773", "AffiliationID": "60005518, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust and King\u2019s College London"}, "7005867806": {"Name": "Peakman M.", "AuthorID": "7005867806", "AffiliationID": "60005518, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust and King\u2019s College London"}, "6602149753": {"Name": "Tree T.I.M.", "AuthorID": "6602149753", "AffiliationID": "60005518, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust and King\u2019s College London"}, "36900561300": {"Name": "Liew A.", "AuthorID": "36900561300", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Newcastle University Translational and Clinical Research Institute"}, "26221546200": {"Name": "Brooks A.M.", "AuthorID": "26221546200", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Newcastle University Translational and Clinical Research Institute"}, "57212468558": {"Name": "Flatt A.", "AuthorID": "57212468558", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Newcastle University Translational and Clinical Research Institute"}, "57217507500": {"Name": "Shaw J.A.", "AuthorID": "57217507500", "AffiliationID": "60018514, 60001239", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Transplantation, Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36536891100": {"Name": "Counter C.", "AuthorID": "36536891100", "AffiliationID": "60030968", "AffiliationName": "Organ Donation and Transplantation, NHS Blood and Transplant"}, "25951256500": {"Name": "Choudhary P.", "AuthorID": "25951256500", "AffiliationID": "60177635, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Diabetes Research Group, Guy\u2019s, King\u2019s and St. Thomas\u2019 School of Medicine, King's College London"}, "7102524579": {"Name": "Forbes S.", "AuthorID": "7102524579", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Edinburgh Transplant Centre and Endocrinology Unit, University of Edinburgh"}, "7201591224": {"Name": "Casey J.", "AuthorID": "7201591224", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Edinburgh Transplant Centre and Endocrinology Unit, University of Edinburgh"}, "57220554356": {"Name": "Rosenthal M.J.", "AuthorID": "57220554356", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Diabetes Service, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7201521766": {"Name": "Rutter M.K.", "AuthorID": "7201521766", "AffiliationID": "60120605, 60111801", "AffiliationName": "Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism Centre, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre"}, "57219097620": {"Name": "Cairns S.", "AuthorID": "57219097620", "AffiliationID": "60025263, 60002975", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Immunology Department, Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"}, "56328137500": {"Name": "Johnson P.", "AuthorID": "56328137500", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Centre for Diabetes Endocrinology and Metabolism, University of Oxford"}}}
