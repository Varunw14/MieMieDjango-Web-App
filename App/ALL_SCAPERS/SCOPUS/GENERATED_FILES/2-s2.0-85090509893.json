All rights reserved.The role of obesity and overweight in occurrence of COVID-19 is unknown. We conducted a large-scale general population study using data from a community-dwelling sample in England (n = 334,329; 56.4 \u00b18.1 y; 54.5% women) with prospective linkage to national registry on hospitalization for COVID-19. Body mass index (BMI, from measured height and weight) was used as an indicator of overall obesity, and waist\u2212hip ratio for central obesity. Main outcome was cases of COVID-19 serious enough to warrant a hospital admission from 16 March 2020 to 26 April 2020. Around 0.2% (n = 640) of the sample were hospitalized for COVID-19. There was an upward linear trend in the likelihood of COVID-19 hospitalization with increasing BMI, that was evident in the overweight (odds ratio, 1.39; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.71; crude incidence 19.1 per 10,000) and obese stage I (1.70;1.34 to 2.16; 23.3 per 10,000) and stage II (3.38; 2.60 to 4.40; 42.7 per 10,000) compared to normal weight (12.5 per 10,000). This gradient was little affected after adjustment for a wide range of covariates; however, controlling for biomarkers, particularly high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and glycated hemoglobin, led to a greater degree of attenuation. A similar pattern of association emerged for waist\u2212hip ratio. In summary, overall and central obesity are risk factors for COVID-19 hospital admission. Elevated risk was apparent even at modest weight gain. The mechanisms may involve impaired glucose and lipid metabolism.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Betacoronavirus", "Body Mass Index", "Cohort Studies", "Coronavirus Infections", "European Continental Ancestry Group", "Female", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Obesity", "Overweight", "Pandemics", "Pneumonia, Viral", "Risk Factors", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090509893", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"8502496600": {"Name": "Hamer M.", "AuthorID": "8502496600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, Faculty Medical Sciences, University College London"}, "57215887745": {"Name": "Gale C.R.", "AuthorID": "57215887745", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Lothian Birth Cohorts, Department of Psychology, University of Edinburgh"}, "57218590862": {"Name": "Kivim\u00e4ki M.", "AuthorID": "57218590862", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7003988354": {"Name": "Batty G.D.", "AuthorID": "7003988354", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
