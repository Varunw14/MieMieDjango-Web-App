Science Education Published by Wiley Periodicals LLCSupporting more equitable participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) remains a key, persistent educational challenge. This paper employs a sociological Bourdieusian lens to explore how equitable youth outcomes might be supported through informal science learning (ISL). Drawing on multimodal, ethnographic data from four case study youth aged 11\u201314 from two ISL programs, we identify four areas of practice that were enacted to a greater or lesser extent in the programs in support of equitable youth outcomes. We identify how the equitable potential of these practices was realized through a disruption of dominant power relations. It is argued that ISL should focus on changing the field, rather than young people. Affordances and limitations of the Bourdieusian lens are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bourdieu", "equity/social justice", "informal science learning (ISL)"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094634864", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["History and Philosophy of Science", "ARTS", "1207"]], "AuthorData": {"7103359770": {"Name": "Archer L.", "AuthorID": "7103359770", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}, "57189708174": {"Name": "Godec S.", "AuthorID": "57189708174", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}, "35325212300": {"Name": "Mau A.", "AuthorID": "35325212300", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}, "57219265145": {"Name": "Patel U.", "AuthorID": "57219265145", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}, "57202437864": {"Name": "Calabrese Barton A.", "AuthorID": "57202437864", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Educational Studies Department, University of Michigan School of Education"}, "36637036800": {"Name": "Dawson E.", "AuthorID": "36637036800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Science and Technology Studies"}}}
