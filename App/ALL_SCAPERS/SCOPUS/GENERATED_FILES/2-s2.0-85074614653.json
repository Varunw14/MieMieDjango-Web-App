Previous studies demonstrate differences in disease severity and phenotype of Asian patients with Crohn\u2019s disease (CD), including Bangladeshi Asians within the UK. No study has evaluated the impact of ethnicity on response to anti-TNFs. Aim: Our primary endpoint was a comparison of failure-free survival on first prescribed anti-TNF (anti-tumor necrosis factor) therapy in UK Bangladeshi and Caucasian patients with CD. Our secondary aims were to evaluate disease phenotype, indication for anti-TNF prescription, and duration from diagnosis until first anti-TNF prescribed between groups. Methods: The records of consecutive outpatient appointments over a 12-month period were used to identify Caucasian and Bangladeshi patients prescribed an anti-TNF for CD. Information on patient demographics, ethnicity, disease phenotype, immunomodulator use, outcome from first biologic, duration of therapy, and reason for cessation was recorded. Results: In total, 224 Caucasian and Bangladeshi patients were prescribed an anti-TNF for CD. Bangladeshi patients started an anti-TNF 4.3 years earlier after diagnosis than Caucasian patients (3.9 years vs. 8.2 years: p < 0.01). Bangladeshi patients experienced shorter failure-free survival than Caucasian patients (1.8 vs. 4.8 years p < 0.01). By 2 years, significantly more Bangladeshi patients had stopped anti-TNF due to loss of response (OR 6.35, p < 0.01). Conclusions: This is the first study to suggest that Bangladeshi patients resident in the UK with CD respond less well to treatment with TNF antagonists than Caucasian patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anti-TNF", "Biologic", "Crohn\u2019s disease", "Ethnicity", "Inflammatory bowel disease"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Asian Continental Ancestry Group", "Bangladesh", "Biomarkers", "Crohn Disease", "European Continental Ancestry Group", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Male", "Retrospective Studies", "Treatment Outcome", "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074614653", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"50061326200": {"Name": "Gadhok R.", "AuthorID": "50061326200", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "The Blizard Institute, Centre for Immunology, Barts and the London School of Medicine, Queen Mary University of London"}, "55943480800": {"Name": "Gordon H.", "AuthorID": "55943480800", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "The Blizard Institute, Centre for Immunology, Barts and the London School of Medicine, Queen Mary University of London"}, "55366728500": {"Name": "Sebepos-Rogers G.", "AuthorID": "55366728500", "AffiliationID": "60010088, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "57211604205": {"Name": "Baillie S.", "AuthorID": "57211604205", "AffiliationID": "60010088, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "57211608021": {"Name": "Akbar S.", "AuthorID": "57211608021", "AffiliationID": "60010088, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "57211609989": {"Name": "Abbott J.E.", "AuthorID": "57211609989", "AffiliationID": "60010088, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "57211603304": {"Name": "Michael E.", "AuthorID": "57211603304", "AffiliationID": "60010088, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "57194317365": {"Name": "Ahmad O.F.", "AuthorID": "57194317365", "AffiliationID": "60010088, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "57211599385": {"Name": "Cooper B.", "AuthorID": "57211599385", "AffiliationID": "60010088, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "7201432421": {"Name": "Lindsay J.O.", "AuthorID": "7201432421", "AffiliationID": "60010088, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust"}}}
