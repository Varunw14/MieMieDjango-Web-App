However, alignment between the functional and anatomical images is crucial. In this study, we propose two algorithms for solving misalignment issues. Both approaches are based on a recently published joint motion estimation and image reconstruction method. The first approach deforms the anatomical image to align it with the functional one while the second approach deforms both images to align them with the measured data. Our current implementation uses alternates between image reconstruction and alignment estimation. To evaluate the potential of these approaches, we have chosen Parallel Level Sets (PLS) as a representative anatomical penalty since it has shown promising results in literature, incorporating a spatially-variant penalty strength to achieve uniform local contrast and fast convergence rate. The performance evaluation was achieved by using simulated non-TOF data generated with an XCAT phantom in the thorax region. We used the attenuation image in the anatomical prior. The results demonstrated that both methods are able to estimate the misalignment and deform the anatomical image accordingly when a proper workflow for the alternating optimization is applied. However, the performance of the first approach depends highly on the workflow of the alternating process. In contrast, the second approach shows the ability to converge to the correct alignment faster than the first approach does, independent of the workflow. Our results indicate that it is possible to align functional and anatomical information, enabling the use of anatomical priors in practice.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alternating optimizations", "Anatomical information", "Anatomical priors", "Dual-modality systems", "Emission tomography", "Fast convergence rate", "Image reconstruction methods", "Joint motion estimations"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073105074", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"]], "AuthorData": {"35621323500": {"Name": "Tsai Y.J.", "AuthorID": "35621323500", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "15842886700": {"Name": "Bousse A.", "AuthorID": "15842886700", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "57203050071": {"Name": "Hutton B.F.", "AuthorID": "57203050071", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "23480655200": {"Name": "Thielemans K.", "AuthorID": "23480655200", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "7401988960": {"Name": "Ahn S.", "AuthorID": "7401988960", "AffiliationID": "60021211", "AffiliationName": "GE Global Research"}, "7006642803": {"Name": "Stearns C.W.", "AuthorID": "7006642803", "AffiliationID": "60106890", "AffiliationName": "MICT Engineering, GE Healthcare"}, "7005759823": {"Name": "Arridge S.", "AuthorID": "7005759823", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
