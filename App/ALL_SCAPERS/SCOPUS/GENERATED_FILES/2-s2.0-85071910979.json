An innovative method was developed, based on solar altitude, to establish cut-off points of daylight and darkness determined from a study of daylight availability in England, Scotland and Wales. This approach provides a rigorous method to differentiate daytime and night-time collisions. The criteria were used in a study of the collisions reported in the STATS19 data set for the weeks either side of the clock changes that are necessary between Greenwich Mean Time and British Summer Time. By comparing periods with the same clock time either side of the time change, using the aforementioned method, it was possible to isolate collisions within the same time period that during one week occurred in darkness and in the other week in daylight. The initial finding was that there are 19.3% more collisions in the dark periods and there is an even greater increase (31.7%) in pedestrian injuries.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Dark periods", "Daylight availability", "Innovative method", "Night time", "Pedestrian injuries", "Road traffic collisions", "Time change", "Time-periods"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071910979", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"6508220745": {"Name": "Raynham P.", "AuthorID": "6508220745", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering, University College London"}, "56669547300": {"Name": "Unwin J.", "AuthorID": "56669547300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering, University College London"}, "57210932342": {"Name": "Tolia S.", "AuthorID": "57210932342", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering, University College London"}, "57220267127": {"Name": "Khazova M.", "AuthorID": "57220267127", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England"}}}
