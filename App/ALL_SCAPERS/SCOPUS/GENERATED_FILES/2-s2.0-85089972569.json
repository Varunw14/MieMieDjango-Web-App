Blood based autologous glue provides an easy, cost-effective way of obtaining high concentrations of growth factors for tissue healing and regeneration with the intention of spraying it onto the implant surface during surgery. The aim of this study was to incorporate nucleated cells from autologous bone marrow (BM) aspirate into gels made from the patient's own blood, and to investigate the effects of incorporating three different concentrations of platelet rich plasma (PRP) on the proliferation and viability of the cells in the gel. Methods: The autologous blood glue (ABG) that constituted 1.25, 2.5, and 5 times concentration PRP were made with and without equal volumes of BM nucleated cells. Proliferation, morphology, and viability of the cells in the glue was measured at days 7 and 14 and compared to cells seeded in fibrin glue. Results: Overall, 2.5 times concentration of PRP in ABG was capable of supporting the maximum growth of cells isolated from the BM aspirate and maintain their characteristics. Irrespective of PRP concentration, cells in ABG had statistically significantly higher viability compared to cells in fibrin glue. Conclusion: In vitro this novel autologous gel is more capable of supporting the growth of cells in its structure for up to 14 days, compared to commercially available fibrin-based sealants, and this difference was statistically significant.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autologous", "Blood glue", "Osseointegration", "Platelet Rich Plasma", "Stem cells"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089972569", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"57193155068": {"Name": "Sanghani-Kerai A.", "AuthorID": "57193155068", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, Division of Surgery and Interventional Sciences, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "55574210357": {"Name": "Brown R.", "AuthorID": "55574210357", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, Division of Surgery and Interventional Sciences, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "57218675261": {"Name": "Lodge G.", "AuthorID": "57218675261", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, Division of Surgery and Interventional Sciences, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "57207710291": {"Name": "Osagie-Clouard L.", "AuthorID": "57207710291", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, Division of Surgery and Interventional Sciences, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "6603029220": {"Name": "Coathup M.", "AuthorID": "6603029220", "AffiliationID": "60022144", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine, University of Central Florida"}, "57206307303": {"Name": "Blunn G.", "AuthorID": "57206307303", "AffiliationID": "60025475", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Portsmouth"}, "57218671624": {"Name": "Graney I.", "AuthorID": "57218671624", "AffiliationID": "125043582", "AffiliationName": "NTL Biologica Limited"}, "8281611700": {"Name": "Skinner J.", "AuthorID": "8281611700", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "23090625400": {"Name": "Gikas P.", "AuthorID": "23090625400", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}}}
