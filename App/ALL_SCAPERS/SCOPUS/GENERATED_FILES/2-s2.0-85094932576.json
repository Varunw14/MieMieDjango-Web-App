However, most of the synthesis methods require prolonged synthesis times from several hours to days. In the present study, we report a rapid synthesis method for [Au25(Cys)18] nanoclusters and their application for photobactericidal enhancement. For [Au25(Cys)18] synthesis, we employed a tube-in-tube membrane reactor using CO as a reducing agent at elevated temperatures. This approach allows continuous generation of high-quality [Au25(Cys)18] within 3 min. Photobactericidal tests against Staphylococcus aureus showed that crystal violet-treated polymer did not have photobactericidal activity, but addition of [Au25(Cys)18] in the treated polymer demonstrated a potent photobactericidal activity at a low white light flux, resulting in >4.29 log reduction in viable bacteria numbers. Steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopies demonstrated that after light irradiation, photoexcited electrons in crystal violet flowed to [Au25(Cys)18] in the silicone, suggesting that redox reaction from [Au25(Cys)18] enhanced the photobactericidal activity. Stability tests revealed that leaching of crystal violet and [Au25(Cys)18] from the treated silicone was negligible and cyclic testing showed that the silicone maintained a strong photobactericidal activity after repeated use.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bactericidal activity", "Continuous flow", "Crystal violet", "Gold nanocluster", "Membrane reactor", "Photocatalyst", "Staphylococcus aureus", "[Au25(Cys)18]"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bacteria number", "Elevated temperature", "Light irradiations", "Membrane reactor", "Photoexcited electrons", "Rapid synthesis", "Synthesis method", "Time resolved photoluminescence spectroscopies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094932576", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"7003522751": {"Name": "Gavriilidis A.", "AuthorID": "7003522751", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "55073511800": {"Name": "Wu G.", "AuthorID": "55073511800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57193344313": {"Name": "Panariello L.", "AuthorID": "57193344313", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57213083930": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "57213083930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "35778301700": {"Name": "Hwang G.B.", "AuthorID": "35778301700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56959691700": {"Name": "Shin J.", "AuthorID": "56959691700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "36947932100": {"Name": "Karu K.", "AuthorID": "36947932100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57200049294": {"Name": "Sebastian V.", "AuthorID": "57200049294", "AffiliationID": "60189536, 60006754, 60016809, 60030975", "AffiliationName": "Nanoscience Institute of Aragon, Aragon Materials Science Institute, ICMA, Csic and Chemical and Environmental Engineering Department, University of Zaragoza"}, "35848365800": {"Name": "Allan E.", "AuthorID": "35848365800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013985", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbial Diseases, Ucl Eastman Dental Institute, Royal Free Campus, University College London"}}}
