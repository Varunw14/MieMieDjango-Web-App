It proceeds by examining in turn the rubrics of the internationally wrongful act, content of responsibility, and implementation of responsibility. On most points, blackletter law is perfectly capable of answering the questions raised by claims related to covid-19. But evolutionary potential inherent in the normal international legal process should also be recognised, whether it manifests itself by further strengthening current rules, elaborating vague rules by application, filling gaps in current law by generating new practice or even, exceptionally, revisiting rules currently in force.", "AuthorKeywords": ["causality", "content of responsibility", "countermeasures", "covid-19", "implementation of responsibility", "internationally wrongful act", "responsibility of international organizations", "State responsibility"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096323820", "SubjectAreas": [["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"55781412100": {"Name": "Paparinskis M.", "AuthorID": "55781412100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Laws, University College London"}}}
