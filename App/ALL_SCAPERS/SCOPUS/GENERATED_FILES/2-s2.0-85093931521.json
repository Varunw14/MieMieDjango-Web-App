New technology based on optical pumping means that we can now consider more flexible and creative sensor placement. Here we explored the magnetic fields generated by a model of the human hippocampus not only across scalp but also at the roof of the mouth. We found that simulated hippocampal sources gave rise to dipolar field patterns with one scalp surface field extremum at the temporal lobe and a corresponding maximum or minimum at the roof of the mouth. We then constructed a fitted dental mould to accommodate an Optically Pumped Magnetometer (OPM). We collected data using a previously validated hippocampal-dependant task to test the empirical utility of a mouth-based sensor, with an accompanying array of left and right temporal lobe OPMs. We found that the mouth sensor showed the greatest task-related theta power change. We found that this sensor had a mild effect on the reconstructed power in the hippocampus (~10% change) but that coherence images between the mouth sensor and reconstructed source images showed a global maximum in the right hippocampus. We conclude that augmenting a scalp-based MEG array with sensors in the mouth shows unique promise for both basic scientists and clinicians interested in interrogating the hippocampus.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hippocampus", "MEG", "Mouth", "OP-MEG", "OPM"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85093931521", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"56921739000": {"Name": "Tierney T.M.", "AuthorID": "56921739000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57219563309": {"Name": "Levy A.", "AuthorID": "57219563309", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "36908712800": {"Name": "Barry D.N.", "AuthorID": "36908712800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57191482453": {"Name": "Meyer S.S.", "AuthorID": "57191482453", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "57205684644": {"Name": "Mellor S.", "AuthorID": "57205684644", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57218666851": {"Name": "Bestmann S.", "AuthorID": "57218666851", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7005945840": {"Name": "Maguire E.A.", "AuthorID": "7005945840", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7202142345": {"Name": "Barnes G.R.", "AuthorID": "7202142345", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "24367176900": {"Name": "Shigihara Y.", "AuthorID": "24367176900", "AffiliationID": "115000202", "AffiliationName": "Hokuto Hospital MEG Lab"}, "57219563382": {"Name": "Everatt M.", "AuthorID": "57219563382", "AffiliationID": "125265753", "AffiliationName": "S4S (UK) Limited & Smilelign Ltd"}, "37561488000": {"Name": "Lopez J.D.", "AuthorID": "37561488000", "AffiliationID": "60055833", "AffiliationName": "Engineering Faculty, Universidad de Antioquia UDEA"}, "57201420913": {"Name": "Holmes N.", "AuthorID": "57201420913", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham, University Park"}, "57201428018": {"Name": "Roberts G.", "AuthorID": "57201428018", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham, University Park"}, "57201632590": {"Name": "Hill R.M.", "AuthorID": "57201632590", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham, University Park"}, "57191490424": {"Name": "Boto E.", "AuthorID": "57191490424", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham, University Park"}, "57197534488": {"Name": "Leggett J.", "AuthorID": "57197534488", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham, University Park"}, "8599486300": {"Name": "Brookes M.J.", "AuthorID": "8599486300", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham, University Park"}, "7005010989": {"Name": "Bowtell R.", "AuthorID": "7005010989", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham, University Park"}, "7201440598": {"Name": "Shah V.", "AuthorID": "7201440598", "AffiliationID": "60112977", "AffiliationName": "QuSpin Inc."}}}
