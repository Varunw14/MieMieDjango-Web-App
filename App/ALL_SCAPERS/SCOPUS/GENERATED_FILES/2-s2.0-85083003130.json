{"Title": "Further development of the 12-item EDE-QS: Identifying a cut-off for screening purposes", "Year": 2020, "Source": "BMC Psychiatry", "Volume": "20", "Issue": 1, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": null, "PageEnd": null, "CitedBy": 3, "DOI": "10.1186/s12888-020-02565-5", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85083003130&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2020 The Author(s).Background: The Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire Short (EDE-QS) was developed as a 12-item version of the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) with a 4-point response scale that assesses eating disorder (ED) symptoms over the preceding 7 days. It has demonstrated good psychometric properties at initial testing. The purpose of this brief report is to determine a threshold score that could be used in screening for probable ED cases in community settings. Methods: Data collected from Gideon et al. (2016) were re-analyzed. In their study, 559 participants (80.86% female; 9.66% self-reported ED diagnosis) completed the EDE-Q, EDE-QS, SCOFF, and Clinical Impairment Assessment (CIA). Discriminatory power was compared between ED instruments using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. Results: A score of 15 emerged as the threshold that ensured the best trade-off between sensitivity (.83) and specificity (.85), and good positive predictive value (.37) for the EDE-QS, with discriminatory power comparable to other ED instruments. Conclusion: The EDE-QS appears to be an instrument with good discriminatory power that could be used for ED screening purposes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Discriminant validity", "Eating disorders", "EDE-QS", "ROC analysis", "Screening"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Feeding and Eating Disorders", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mass Screening", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Psychometrics", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083003130", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57211074081": {"Name": "Prnjak K.", "AuthorID": "57211074081", "AffiliationID": "60017803", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, Western Sydney University"}, "37064919400": {"Name": "Mitchison D.", "AuthorID": "37064919400", "AffiliationID": "60019544, 60088314", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Emotional Health, Department of Psychology, Macquarie University"}, "7006049723": {"Name": "Mond J.", "AuthorID": "7006049723", "AffiliationID": "60015356", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rural Health, University of Tasmania"}, "7103401187": {"Name": "Hay P.", "AuthorID": "7103401187", "AffiliationID": "120465070", "AffiliationName": "Camden and Campbelltown Hospitals, Swslhd"}, "55681083600": {"Name": "Griffiths S.", "AuthorID": "55681083600", "AffiliationID": "60118640, 60026553", "AffiliationName": "Physical Appearance Research Team, Melbourne School of Psychological Sciences, University of Melbourne"}, "57189342019": {"Name": "Gideon N.", "AuthorID": "57189342019", "AffiliationID": "60171632", "AffiliationName": "Suffolk Family Focus Psychology Service, Norfolk and Suffolk Nhs Foundation Trust"}, "55747914900": {"Name": "Serpell L.", "AuthorID": "55747914900", "AffiliationID": "60107401", "AffiliationName": "North East London Nhs Foundation Trust"}}}
