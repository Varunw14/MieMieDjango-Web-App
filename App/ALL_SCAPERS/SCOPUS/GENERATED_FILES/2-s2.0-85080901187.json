We used pre-existing, but fragmentary, structures to model a complete ectodomain of the major glycoprotein E2 from three strains of HCV. We then performed molecular dynamic simulations to explore the conformational landscape of E2, revealing a number of important features. Despite high sequence divergence, and subtle differences in the models, E2 from different strains behave similarly, possessing a stable core flanked by highly flexible regions, some of which perform essential functions such as receptor binding. Comparison with sequence data suggest that this consistent behaviour is conferred by a network of conserved residues that act as hinge and anchor points throughout E2. The variable regions (HVR-1, HVR-2 and VR-3) exhibit particularly high flexibility, and bioinformatic analysis suggests that HVR-1 is a putative intrinsically disordered protein region. Dynamic cross-correlation analyses demonstrate intramolecular communication and suggest that specific regions, such as HVR-1, can exert influence throughout E2. To support our computational approach we performed small-angle X-ray scattering with purified E2 ectodomain; this data was consistent with our MD experiments, suggesting a compact globular core with peripheral flexible regions. This work captures the dynamic behaviour of E2 and has direct relevance to the interaction of HCV with cell-surface receptors and neutralising antibodies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Antibodies, Viral", "Computer Simulation", "Epitopes", "Glycosylation", "HEK293 Cells", "Hepatitis C", "Humans", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Protein Binding", "Protein Domains", "Scattering, Radiation", "Viral Envelope Proteins", "Virus Internalization", "X-Rays"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85080901187", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"]], "AuthorData": {"56845177600": {"Name": "Stejskal L.", "AuthorID": "56845177600", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College"}, "57215430503": {"Name": "Palor M.", "AuthorID": "57215430503", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "16052876600": {"Name": "Grove J.", "AuthorID": "16052876600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "36138581400": {"Name": "Lees W.D.", "AuthorID": "36138581400", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College"}, "7201847823": {"Name": "Moss D.S.", "AuthorID": "7201847823", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College"}, "36118495000": {"Name": "Shepherd A.J.", "AuthorID": "36118495000", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College"}, "8664839300": {"Name": "Bingham R.J.", "AuthorID": "8664839300", "AffiliationID": "60032343", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of Huddersfield"}}}
