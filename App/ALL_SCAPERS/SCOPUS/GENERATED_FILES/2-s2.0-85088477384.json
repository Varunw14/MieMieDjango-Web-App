The techniques include B-scans, standardised A-scans, and ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM). B-scans give information on the topography of the intraocular tumour, noting its shape and location. Measurements of the tumour dimensions are taken in two orthogonal meridians. Serial measurements are useful for monitoring or response to treatment. Colour flow mapping and spectral Doppler techniques add to the B-scan to give an idea of blood flow through the tumour. Standardized A-scans can be used if necessary to give more information on reflectivity and attenuation of ultrasound waves. The ultrasound biomicrocope (UBM) uses a higher frequency transducer to image more anterior structures such as the iris and ciliary body.", "AuthorKeywords": ["B-scans", "Standardised A-scans", "Ultrasound biomicroscopy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088477384", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"6701811432": {"Name": "Restori M.", "AuthorID": "6701811432", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Ultrasound Department, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "57203054292": {"Name": "Sagoo M.S.", "AuthorID": "57203054292", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
