It is produced de-novo in the brain in very small amounts compared to other catecholamines, including noradrenaline. Although the effects of adrenaline on neurons have been extensively studied, much less is known about the action of this hormone on astrocytes. Here, we studied the effects of adrenaline on astrocytes in primary co-culture of neurons and astrocytes. Application of adrenaline induced calcium signal in both neurons and astrocytes, but only in neurons this effect was dependent on \u03b1- and \u03b2-receptor antagonists. The effects of adrenaline on astrocytes were less dependent on adrenoreceptors: the antagonist carvedilol had only moderate effect on the calcium signal and the agonist of adrenoreceptors methoxamine induced a signal only in small proportion of the cells. We found that adrenaline in astrocytes activates phospholipase C and subsequent release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum. Calcium signal in astrocytes is initiated by the metabolism of adrenaline by the monoamine oxidase (MAO), which activates reactive oxygen species production and induces lipid peroxidation. Inhibitor of MAO selegiline inhibited both adrenaline-induced calcium signal in astrocytes and the vasoconstriction that indicates an important role for monoamine oxidase in adrenaline-induced signalling and function.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adrenaline", "Astrocytes", "Calcium", "Monoamine oxidase", "Neurons", "Vasoconstriction"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088961617", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"57194047222": {"Name": "Novikova I.N.", "AuthorID": "57194047222", "AffiliationID": "60070544", "AffiliationName": "Cell Physiology and Pathology Laboratory, Orel State University"}, "56007550800": {"Name": "Zherebtsov E.A.", "AuthorID": "56007550800", "AffiliationID": "60012954", "AffiliationName": "Optoelectronics and Measurement Techniques Laboratory, University of Oulu"}, "57209689630": {"Name": "Stavtsev D.D.", "AuthorID": "57209689630", "AffiliationID": "60070544", "AffiliationName": "Cell Physiology and Pathology Laboratory, Orel State University"}, "55704382900": {"Name": "Dunaev A.V.", "AuthorID": "55704382900", "AffiliationID": "60070544", "AffiliationName": "Cell Physiology and Pathology Laboratory, Orel State University"}, "7102348938": {"Name": "Abramov A.Y.", "AuthorID": "7102348938", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "57220355761": {"Name": "Manole A.", "AuthorID": "57220355761", "AffiliationID": "60032445", "AffiliationName": "Salk Institute for Biological Studies"}, "6504452275": {"Name": "Vukolova M.N.", "AuthorID": "6504452275", "AffiliationID": "60010188", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathophysiology, Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University"}, "56081167500": {"Name": "Angelova P.R.", "AuthorID": "56081167500", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}}}
