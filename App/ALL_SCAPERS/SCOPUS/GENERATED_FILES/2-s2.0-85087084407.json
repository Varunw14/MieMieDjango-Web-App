CFPS has emerged as a powerful platform technology for synthetic gene network design, biosensing and on-demand biomanufacturing. Whilst primarily of bacterial origin, cell-free extracts derived from a variety of host organisms have been explored, aiming to capitalise on cellular diversity and the advantageous properties associated with those organisms. However, cell-free extracts produced from eukaryotes are often overlooked due to their relatively low yields, despite the potential for improved protein folding and posttranslational modifications. Here we describe further development of a Pichia pastoris cell-free platform, a widely used expression host in both academia and the biopharmaceutical industry. Using a minimised Design of Experiments (DOE) approach, we were able to increase the productivity of the system by improving the composition of the complex reaction mixture. This was achieved in a minimal number of experimental runs, within the constraints of the design and without the need for liquid-handling robots. In doing so, we were able to estimate the main effects impacting productivity in the system and increased the protein synthesis of firefly luciferase and the biopharmaceutical HSA by 4.8-fold and 3.5-fold, respectively. This study highlights the P. pastoris-based cell-free system as a highly productive eukaryotic platform and displays the value of minimised DOE designs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cell-free protein synthesis", "Design of experiments (DOE)", "Pichia pastoris", "Synthetic biology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087084407", "SubjectAreas": [["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology", "IMMU", "2402"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"57215524704": {"Name": "Spice A.J.", "AuthorID": "57215524704", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Centre for Synthetic Biology, Imperial College London"}, "55968247200": {"Name": "Aw R.", "AuthorID": "55968247200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Centre for Synthetic Biology, Imperial College London"}, "10039266100": {"Name": "Polizzi K.M.", "AuthorID": "10039266100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Centre for Synthetic Biology, Imperial College London"}, "6602592324": {"Name": "Bracewell D.G.", "AuthorID": "6602592324", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
