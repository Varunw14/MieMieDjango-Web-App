Quantification of this phenomenon typically relies on cue competition paradigms. Here, we sought to exploit gaze patterns during exclusive presentation of a visual conditioned stimulus, in order to quantify human threat conditioning. To this end, we capitalized on a summary statistic of visual search during CS presentation, scanpath length. During a simple delayed threat conditioning paradigm with full-screen monochrome conditioned stimuli (CS), we observed shorter scanpath length during CS+ compared to CS- presentation. Retrodictive validity, i.e., effect size to distinguish CS+ and CS-, was maximized by considering a 2-s time window before US onset. Taking into account the shape of the scan speed response resulted in similar retrodictive validity. The mechanism underlying shorter scanpath length appeared to be longer fixation duration and more fixation on the screen center during CS+ relative to CS- presentation. These findings were replicated in a second experiment with similar setup, and further confirmed in a third experiment using full-screen patterns as CS. This experiment included an extinction session during which scanpath differences appeared to extinguish. In a fourth experiment with auditory CS and instruction to fixate screen center, no scanpath length differences were observed. In conclusion, our study suggests scanpath length as a visual search summary statistic, which may be used as complementary measure to quantify threat conditioning with retrodictive validity similar to that of skin conductance responses.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attentional bias", "Fear conditioning", "Pavlovian conditioning", "Saccadic eye movement", "Threat memory"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095695237", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Psychology (miscellaneous)", "PSYC", "3201"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"57208548915": {"Name": "Xia Y.", "AuthorID": "57208548915", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "University of Zurich"}, "55913383600": {"Name": "Melinscak F.", "AuthorID": "55913383600", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "University of Zurich"}, "9746516300": {"Name": "Bach D.R.", "AuthorID": "9746516300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
