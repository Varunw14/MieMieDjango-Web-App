During this period, many societies began to invest heavily in building monuments, which suggests an increase in social organization. The scale and sophistication of megalithic architecture along the Atlantic seaboard, culminating in the great passage tomb complexes, is particularly impressive2. Although co-operative ideology has often been emphasised as a driver of megalith construction1, the human expenditure required to erect the largest monuments has led some researchers to emphasize hierarchy3\u2014of which the most extreme case is a small elite marshalling the labour of the masses. Here we present evidence that a social stratum of this type was established during the Neolithic period in Ireland. We sampled 44 whole genomes, among which we identify the adult son of a first-degree incestuous union from remains that were discovered within the most elaborate recess of the Newgrange passage tomb. Socially sanctioned matings of this nature are very rare, and are documented almost exclusively among politico-religious elites4\u2014specifically within polygynous and patrilineal royal families that are headed by god-kings5,6. We identify relatives of this individual within two other major complexes of passage tombs 150 km to the west of Newgrange, as well as dietary differences and fine-scale haplotypic structure (which is unprecedented in resolution for a prehistoric population) between passage tomb samples and the larger dataset, which together imply hierarchy. This elite emerged against a backdrop of rapid maritime colonization that displaced a unique Mesolithic isolate population, although we also detected rare Irish hunter-gatherer introgression within the Neolithic population.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Burial", "Consanguinity", "DNA, Ancient", "Family", "Female", "Genome, Human", "Haplotypes", "Hierarchy, Social", "History, Ancient", "Humans", "Incest", "Ireland", "Male", "Societies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086580467", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56967817100": {"Name": "Cassidy L.M.", "AuthorID": "56967817100", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Smurfit Institute of Genetics, Trinity College Dublin"}, "57217169643": {"Name": "Maold\u00fain R.", "AuthorID": "57217169643", "AffiliationID": "124443343", "AffiliationName": "Archaeological Management Solutions"}, "57217167248": {"Name": "Noonan A.", "AuthorID": "57217167248", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Smurfit Institute of Genetics, Trinity College Dublin"}, "57217164384": {"Name": "Campbell C.", "AuthorID": "57217164384", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Smurfit Institute of Genetics, Trinity College Dublin"}, "56957543700": {"Name": "Jones E.R.", "AuthorID": "56957543700", "AffiliationID": "118075651", "AffiliationName": "Genomics Medicine Ireland"}, "6603315119": {"Name": "Mattiangeli V.", "AuthorID": "6603315119", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Smurfit Institute of Genetics, Trinity College Dublin"}, "7403122733": {"Name": "Bradley D.G.", "AuthorID": "7403122733", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Smurfit Institute of Genetics, Trinity College Dublin"}, "56816978900": {"Name": "Kador T.", "AuthorID": "56816978900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Arts and Sciences, University College London"}, "57217164651": {"Name": "Lynch A.", "AuthorID": "57217164651", "AffiliationID": "119185953", "AffiliationName": "National Monuments Service, Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht"}, "55474311000": {"Name": "Jones C.", "AuthorID": "55474311000", "AffiliationID": "60008539", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Archaeology, and Irish Studies, National University of Ireland Galway"}, "7005268864": {"Name": "Woodman P.C.", "AuthorID": "7005268864", "AffiliationID": "60025160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology, University College Cork"}, "7401684031": {"Name": "Murphy E.", "AuthorID": "7401684031", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "Archaeology and Palaeoecology, School of Natural and Built Environment, Queen\u2019s University Belfast"}, "57188857994": {"Name": "Ramsey G.", "AuthorID": "57188857994", "AffiliationID": "124058261", "AffiliationName": "National Museums NI"}, "35840901800": {"Name": "Dowd M.", "AuthorID": "35840901800", "AffiliationID": "60026186", "AffiliationName": "CERIS, School of Science, Institute of Technology Sligo"}}}
