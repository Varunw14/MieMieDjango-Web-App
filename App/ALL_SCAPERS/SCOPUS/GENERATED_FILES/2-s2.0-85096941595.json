The as-synthesized samples were collected from the outlet of the process and then cleaned and freeze-dried before being evaluated individually as oxygen reduction catalysts using a rotating disk electrode testing technique. To establish any correlations between physical and electrochemical characterization data, the as-synthesized samples were investigated using analytical methods including BET surface area, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and in selected cases, transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The aforementioned approach was validated as being able to quickly identify oxygen reduction catalysts from new libraries of electrocatalysts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["combinatorial synthesis", "continuous hydrothermal flow synthesis", "electrocatalysis", "green chemistry", "oxygen reduction reaction", "X-ray diffraction"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096941595", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"57211622990": {"Name": "Groves A.R.", "AuthorID": "57211622990", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56096150800": {"Name": "Ashton T.E.", "AuthorID": "56096150800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6603926697": {"Name": "Darr J.A.", "AuthorID": "6603926697", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
