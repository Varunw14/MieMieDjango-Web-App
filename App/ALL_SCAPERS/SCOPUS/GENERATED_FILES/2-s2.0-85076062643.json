METHODS: We enrolled 742 pregnant, low-income women with no previous live births and randomly assigned them to receive either free transportation for prenatal care plus child development screening and referral (control; n = 514) or prenatal and infant home nurse visit (NV) plus transportation and screening (n = 228). Assessments were completed on 629 18- year-old first-born offspring to evaluate these primary outcomes: (1) cognitive-related abilities (nonverbal intelligence, receptive language, and math achievement) and (2) behavioral health (internalizing behavioral problems, substance use and abuse, sexually transmitted infections, HIV risk, arrests, convictions, and gang membership). RESULTS: Compared with control-group counterparts, NV youth born to mothers with LPR had better receptive language (effect size = 0.24; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.00 to 0.47; P = .05), math achievement (effect size = 0.38; 95% CI: 0.14 to 0.61; P = .002), and a number of secondary cognitive-related outcomes. NV females, as a trend, had fewer convictions (incidence ratio = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.20 to 1.11; P = .08). There were no intervention effects on other behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: The program improved the cognitive-related skills of 18-year-olds born to mothers with LPR and, as a trend, reduced female convictions but produced no other effects on youth behavioral health.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Cognition", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Health Risk Behaviors", "Home Care Services", "House Calls", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Nurses, Community Health", "Poverty", "Pregnancy", "Prenatal Care", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076062643", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"57220353882": {"Name": "Kitzman H.", "AuthorID": "57220353882", "AffiliationID": "60027165", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing, University of Rochester"}, "7401590266": {"Name": "Cole R.", "AuthorID": "7401590266", "AffiliationID": "60027165", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing, University of Rochester"}, "8645554900": {"Name": "Anson E.", "AuthorID": "8645554900", "AffiliationID": "60027165", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing, University of Rochester"}, "7410180227": {"Name": "Smith J.A.", "AuthorID": "7410180227", "AffiliationID": "60027165", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing, University of Rochester"}, "57207507322": {"Name": "Olds D.L.", "AuthorID": "57207507322", "AffiliationID": "60028392", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus"}, "21334717000": {"Name": "Knudtson M.D.", "AuthorID": "21334717000", "AffiliationID": "60028392", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus"}, "7006449299": {"Name": "Fishbein D.", "AuthorID": "7006449299", "AffiliationID": "60001439", "AffiliationName": "Edna Bennett Pierce Prevention Research Center, Pennsylvania State University"}, "7005292881": {"Name": "DiClemente R.", "AuthorID": "7005292881", "AffiliationID": "60021784", "AffiliationName": "College of Global Public Health, New York University"}, "57193952366": {"Name": "Wingood G.", "AuthorID": "57193952366", "AffiliationID": "60027565, 60030162", "AffiliationName": "Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University"}, "7004310007": {"Name": "Caliendo A.M.", "AuthorID": "7004310007", "AffiliationID": "60009796, 60011460", "AffiliationName": "Warren Alpert Medical School, Brown University"}, "6603894907": {"Name": "Hopfer C.", "AuthorID": "6603894907", "AffiliationID": "60028392", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Psychiatry, University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus"}, "7403948600": {"Name": "Miller T.", "AuthorID": "7403948600", "AffiliationID": "60031226, 60090173, 60031816", "AffiliationName": "Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, School of Public Health, Curtin University"}, "8655661200": {"Name": "Conti G.", "AuthorID": "8655661200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Economics and Social Science, University College London"}}}
