The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.We examine the effects of supermassive black hole (SMBH) feedback on the circumgalactic medium (CGM) using a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation (Romulus25) and a set of four zoom-in \"genetically modified\" Milky-Way-mass galaxies sampling different evolutionary paths. By tracing the distribution of metals in the CGM, we show that O vi is a sensitive indicator of SMBH feedback. First, we calculate the column densities of O vi in simulated Milky-Way-mass galaxies and compare them with observations from the COS-Halos Survey. Our simulations show column densities of O vi in the CGM consistent with those of COS-Halos star-forming and quenched galaxies. These results contrast with those from previous simulation studies which typically underproduce CGM column densities of O vi. We determine that a galaxy's star formation history and assembly record have little effect on the amount of O vi in its CGM. Instead, column densities of O vi are closely tied to galaxy halo mass and BH growth history. The set of zoom-in, genetically modified Milky-Way-mass galaxies indicates that the SMBH drives highly metal-enriched material out into its host galaxy's halo, which in turn elevates the column densities of O vi in the CGM.", "AuthorKeywords": ["galaxies: halos", "galaxies: kinematics and dynamics", "galaxies: spiral", "intergalactic medium", "methods: numerical"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072323013", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57220517687": {"Name": "Sanchez N.N.", "AuthorID": "57220517687", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Astronomy Department, University of Washington"}, "14059310500": {"Name": "Werk J.K.", "AuthorID": "14059310500", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Astronomy Department, University of Washington"}, "7402746313": {"Name": "Quinn T.", "AuthorID": "7402746313", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Astronomy Department, University of Washington"}, "57214610032": {"Name": "Cruz A.", "AuthorID": "57214610032", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Astronomy Department, University of Washington"}, "36634963100": {"Name": "Tremmel M.", "AuthorID": "36634963100", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Yale Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics, Physics Department"}, "22036053000": {"Name": "Pontzen A.", "AuthorID": "22036053000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "28067739000": {"Name": "Christensen C.", "AuthorID": "28067739000", "AffiliationID": "60028806", "AffiliationName": "Physics Department, Grinnell College"}}}
