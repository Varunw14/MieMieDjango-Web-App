At the same time, a reduction in the IIS pathway activity can extend lifespan and healthspan in various model organisms. Amongst a number of body organs that sense and respond to insulin/IGF-1, the adipose tissue has a central role in both the metabolic and lifespan effects of IIS at the organismal level. Genetic inactivation of IIS components specifically in the adipose tissue has been shown before to improve metabolic profile and extend lifespan in various model organisms. We sought to identify conserved molecular mechanisms that may underlie the beneficial effects of IIS inhibition in the adipose tissue, specifically at the level of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), a key IIS effector molecule. To this end, we inactivated PI3K by genetic means in the fly fat body and by pharmacological inhibition in mammalian adipocytes. Gene expression studies revealed changes to metabolism and upregulation of mitochondrial activity in mouse adipocytes and fly fat bodies with downregulated PI3K, which were confirmed by biochemical assays in mammalian adipocytes. These data suggest that PI3K inactivation has a conserved effect of upregulating mitochondrial metabolism in both fly and mammalian adipose tissue, which likely contributes to the health- and life-span extending effect of IIS pathway downregulation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["3T3-L1 Cells", "Adipose Tissue", "Animals", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Drosophila Proteins", "Insulin", "Lipid Metabolism", "Mice", "Mitochondria", "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096079779", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"35101272600": {"Name": "Bettedi L.", "AuthorID": "35101272600", "AffiliationID": "60017777", "AffiliationName": "National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), MD"}, "57208164308": {"Name": "Yan A.", "AuthorID": "57208164308", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Healthy Ageing and Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "6602213773": {"Name": "Alic N.", "AuthorID": "6602213773", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Healthy Ageing and Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "6602573458": {"Name": "Foukas L.C.", "AuthorID": "6602573458", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Healthy Ageing and Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "57219918388": {"Name": "Schuster E.", "AuthorID": "57219918388", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Endocrinology Team, Breast Cancer Now, Institute of Cancer Research"}}}
