However, the limited mechanical properties and heterogeneous dimensions of natural bamboo poles curb the application of bamboo in building structures. A transverse section of engineered bamboo is regular and compact, and its mechanical properties are stable, which can meet the requirements for physical and mechanical properties of materials in modern building structures. Though application of engineered bamboo has just started, it is of great significance to study the connection performance and corresponding influence factors for popularization and application of modern bamboo structures. This paper is focused on a review of research progress for connections in engineered bamboo structures. Firstly, a study on embedding strength and the performance of bolted joints is presented, including calculation methods described with a proposal for future development of standards suitable for the characteristics of engineered bamboo materials. Secondly, research on carpentry joints is introduced, namely tenon-mortise joints, nail joints and truss plate joints. Finally, some engineering examples are briefly introduced. This work can provide a reference for further research on connections in engineered bamboo structures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Connection", "Connection calculation", "Embedding strength", "Engineered bamboo"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bamboo structures", "Connection", "Connection calculation", "Embedding strength", "Green building materials", "Modern buildings", "Physical and mechanical properties", "Transverse section"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081023300", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Architecture", "ENGI", "2216"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"]], "AuthorData": {"57210444640": {"Name": "Hong C.", "AuthorID": "57210444640", "AffiliationID": "60025665", "AffiliationName": "Joint International Research Laboratory of Bio-composite Building Materials and Structures, Nanjing Forestry University"}, "51763890000": {"Name": "Li H.", "AuthorID": "51763890000", "AffiliationID": "60025665", "AffiliationName": "Joint International Research Laboratory of Bio-composite Building Materials and Structures, Nanjing Forestry University"}, "57211528647": {"Name": "Yang D.", "AuthorID": "57211528647", "AffiliationID": "60025665", "AffiliationName": "Joint International Research Laboratory of Bio-composite Building Materials and Structures, Nanjing Forestry University"}, "57202782803": {"Name": "Zhang H.", "AuthorID": "57202782803", "AffiliationID": "60025665", "AffiliationName": "Joint International Research Laboratory of Bio-composite Building Materials and Structures, Nanjing Forestry University"}, "57209629395": {"Name": "Xiong Z.", "AuthorID": "57209629395", "AffiliationID": "120896362", "AffiliationName": "Ganzhou Sentai Bamboo Company LTD"}, "56188746400": {"Name": "Lorenzo R.", "AuthorID": "56188746400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6506438879": {"Name": "Corbi I.", "AuthorID": "6506438879", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "University of Naples Federico II"}, "6602249325": {"Name": "Corbi O.", "AuthorID": "6602249325", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "University of Naples Federico II"}, "57190007698": {"Name": "Wei D.", "AuthorID": "57190007698", "AffiliationID": "123994696", "AffiliationName": "Jiangxi Feiyu Bamboo Stock Co.
