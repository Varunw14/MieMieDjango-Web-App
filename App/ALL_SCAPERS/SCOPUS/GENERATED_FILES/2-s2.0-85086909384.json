In this study, we use UK primary care electronic health records (EHR) from the CALIBER resource to identify and characterize clinically-meaningful clusters patients using unsupervised learning approaches of MCA and K-means. We discovered and characterized five clusters with different profiles (mental health, non-typical AD, typical AD, CVD and men with cancer). The mental health cluster had faster rate of progression than all the other clusters making it a target for future research and intervention. Our results demonstrate that unsupervised learning approaches can be utilized on EHR to identify subtypes of heterogeneous conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Electronic health records", "Machine learning", "Phenotyping"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Electronic health record", "Faster rates", "Heterogeneous conditions", "K-means", "Mental health", "Primary care", "Alzheimer Disease", "Electronic Health Records", "Humans", "Male", "Primary Health Care", "Unsupervised Machine Learning"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086909384", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"], ["Health Information Management", "HEAL", "3605"]], "AuthorData": {"55471888800": {"Name": "Alexander N.", "AuthorID": "55471888800", "AffiliationID": "121377269", "AffiliationName": "Health Data Research"}, "57217273314": {"Name": "Denaxas S.", "AuthorID": "57217273314", "AffiliationID": "60111768", "AffiliationName": "Alan Turing Institute"}, "7402830766": {"Name": "Alexander D.C.", "AuthorID": "7402830766", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57204594265": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "57204594265", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research, University College London, Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre"}}}
