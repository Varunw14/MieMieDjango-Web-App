Epilepsia Open published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of International League Against EpilepsyObjectives: To describe clinical characteristics of a community-based epilepsy cohort from resource-limited communities in Punjab, Northwest India. Methods: The cohort was gathered following a two-stage screening survey. We cross-sectionally examined and followed up the cohort for one year. A panel of neurologists assigned seizure types, syndromes, and putative etiologies and categorized drug responsiveness. Results: The cohort of 240 included 161 (67.1%) men, 109 (45.4%) illiterates and 149 (62.1%) unemployed. Current age was >18 years in 155 (64.6%) but age at epilepsy onset was <18 years in 173 (72.1%). Epilepsies due to structural and metabolic causes were diagnosed in 99 (41.3%), but syndromic assignments were not possible in 97 (40.4%). After one year, drug-resistant epilepsy was established in 74 (30.8%). Perinatal events (n = 35; 14.6%) followed by CNS infections (n = 32; 13.3%) and traumatic brain injury (n = 12; 5.0%) were common risk factors. Most of those with CNS infections (n = 19; 63.3%), perinatal antecedents (n = 23; 76.7%), and other acquired risk factors (n = 27; 90.0%) presented with epilepsy due to structural and metabolic causes. Perinatal events were the putative etiology for nearly 40.7% of generalized epilepsies due to structural and metabolic causes and 28.2% of all epilepsies with onset <10 years. Significance: Existing classifications schemes should be better suited to field conditions in resource-limited communities in low- and middle-income countries. The finding of drug-resistant epilepsy in nearly at least a third in a community-based sample underscores an unmet need for enhancing services for this segment within healthcare systems. Perinatal events, CNS infections, and head injury account for a third of all epilepsies and hence preventative interventions focusing on these epilepsy risk factors should be stepped up.", "AuthorKeywords": ["classification", "epileptic syndromes", "etiology", "perinatal accidents", "prevention"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094673960", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57199952188": {"Name": "Singh G.", "AuthorID": "57199952188", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "NIHR University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "57219664703": {"Name": "Singhal S.", "AuthorID": "57219664703", "AffiliationID": "60007506", "AffiliationName": "Research & Development Unit, Dayanand Medical College"}, "57207451964": {"Name": "Sharma S.", "AuthorID": "57207451964", "AffiliationID": "60007506", "AffiliationName": "Research & Development Unit, Dayanand Medical College"}, "57204174727": {"Name": "Bansal N.", "AuthorID": "57204174727", "AffiliationID": "60007506", "AffiliationName": "Research & Development Unit, Dayanand Medical College"}, "8445721200": {"Name": "Paul B.S.", "AuthorID": "8445721200", "AffiliationID": "60007506", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Dayanand Medical College"}, "55016918500": {"Name": "Bansal R.K.", "AuthorID": "55016918500", "AffiliationID": "60007506", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Dayanand Medical College"}, "57188659835": {"Name": "Sander J.W.", "AuthorID": "57188659835", "AffiliationID": "60027759", "AffiliationName": "Stichting Epilepsie Instellingen Nederland (SEIN)"}, "36018455500": {"Name": "Chaudhary A.", "AuthorID": "36018455500", "AffiliationID": "60007506", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social & Preventive Medicine, Dayanand Medical College"}, "56119755200": {"Name": "Sharma S.", "AuthorID": "56119755200", "AffiliationID": "60007506", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social & Preventive Medicine, Dayanand Medical College"}, "7005548358": {"Name": "Goraya J.S.", "AuthorID": "7005548358", "AffiliationID": "60007506", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Dayanand Medical College"}, "57220420277": {"Name": "Setia R.K.", "AuthorID": "57220420277", "AffiliationID": "100325999", "AffiliationName": "Punjab Remote Sensing Centre"}}}
