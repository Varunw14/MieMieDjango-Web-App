However, constructing an accurate phantom for EIT research remains critical; some studies have attempted to model the skull and breasts, and even fewer, as yet, have considered the thorax. In this study, a critical comparison between the electrical properties (impedance) of three materials is undertaken: a polyurethane foam, a silicone mixture and a thermoplastic polyurethane filament. The latter was identified as the most promising material and adopted for the development of a flexible neonatal torso. The validation is performed by the EIT image reconstruction of the air filled cavities, which mimic the lung regions. The methodology is reproducible for the creation of any phantom that requires a slight flexibility.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D printing", "Conductive", "EIT", "Flexible", "Phantom"], "IndexKeywords": ["3-D printing", "Air-filled cavities", "Conductive", "Electrical impe dance tomography (EIT)", "Flexible", "Imaging algorithm", "Phantom experiment", "Thermoplastic polyurethanes", "Algorithms", "Electric Impedance", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Materials Testing", "Phantoms, Imaging", "Printing, Three-Dimensional", "Thorax", "Tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077927409", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"57190879088": {"Name": "de Gelidi S.", "AuthorID": "57190879088", "AffiliationID": "60014105", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Science and Technology, Middlesex University"}, "35103442400": {"Name": "Seifnaraghi N.", "AuthorID": "35103442400", "AffiliationID": "60014105", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Science and Technology, Middlesex University"}, "8875838100": {"Name": "Bardill A.", "AuthorID": "8875838100", "AffiliationID": "60014105", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Science and Technology, Middlesex University"}, "8681512800": {"Name": "Tizzard A.", "AuthorID": "8681512800", "AffiliationID": "60014105", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Science and Technology, Middlesex University"}, "6603764288": {"Name": "Bayford R.", "AuthorID": "6603764288", "AffiliationID": "60014105", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Science and Technology, Middlesex University"}, "56673175100": {"Name": "Wu Y.", "AuthorID": "56673175100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6603720155": {"Name": "Demosthenous A.", "AuthorID": "6603720155", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55091385100": {"Name": "Frerichs I.", "AuthorID": "55091385100", "AffiliationID": "123767946", "AffiliationName": "University Medical Centre Schlewig-Holstein"}}}
