The aim of this exploratory study was to gauge whether children and young adults in the UK were comfortable with the idea of rectal drug delivery. Methods: Eleven children from a pre-existing patient and public advisory group were involved in the session. Rectal drug delivery was explained and group participants were asked a series of questions. Responses were discussed in a group and recorded individually. Results: Of the group, 27% would consider the rectal route, while 64% said it depended on other options available. The primary concern focused on potential for abusive misuse by others. Participants thought this would be overcome if the child could self-administer, although there was also concern about the process of self-administration. Conclusions: Not all children in the UK are against rectal drug delivery, but education is needed to teach children to self-administer medication in this way.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Drug delivery", "Paediatrics", "Patient and public involvement", "Rectal route"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092386206", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"57205373200": {"Name": "Hanning S.M.", "AuthorID": "57205373200", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, The University of Auckland"}, "8446290500": {"Name": "Tuleu C.", "AuthorID": "8446290500", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57220922572": {"Name": "Walker E.", "AuthorID": "57220922572", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Centre, Great Ormond Street Hospital and University College London"}, "57219360095": {"Name": "Sutcliffe E.", "AuthorID": "57219360095", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "London Generation R Young Persons Advisory Group, Biomedical Research Centre, Great Ormond Street Hospital and University College London"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
