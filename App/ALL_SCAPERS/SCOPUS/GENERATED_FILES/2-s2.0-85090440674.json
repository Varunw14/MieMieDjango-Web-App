The core idea is to parameterize a distribution on labeled graphs in terms of a Fr\u00e9chet mean graph (which depends on a user-specified choice of metric or graph distance) and a parameter that controls the concentration of this distribution about its mean. Entropy is the natural parameter for such control, varying from a point mass concentrated on the Fr\u00e9chet mean itself to a uniform distribution over all graphs on a given vertex set. We provide a hierarchical Bayesian approach for exploiting this construction, along with straightforward strategies for sampling from the resultant posterior distribution. We conclude by demonstrating the efficacy of our approach via simulation studies and two multiple-network data analysis examples: one drawn from systems biology and the other from neuroscience.
