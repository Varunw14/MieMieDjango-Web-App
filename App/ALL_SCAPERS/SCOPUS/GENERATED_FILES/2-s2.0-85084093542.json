Objective: We describe clinical, histological, and radiological outcomes from an established AS programme, where protocol-based biopsies were omitted in favour of MRI-led monitoring. Design, setting, and participants: Data on 672 men enrolled in AS between August 2004 and November 2017 (inclusion criteria: Gleason 3 + 3 or 3 + 4 localised prostate cancer, presenting prostate-specific antigen <20 ng/ml, and baseline mpMRI) were collected from the University College London Hospital (UCLH) database. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Primary outcomes were event-free survival (EFS; event defined as prostate cancer treatment, transition to watchful waiting, or death) and treatment-free survival (TFS). Secondary outcomes included rates of all-cause or prostate cancer\u2013related mortality, metastasis, and upgrading to Gleason \u22654 + 3. Data on radiological and histological progression were also collected. Results and limitations: More than 3800 person-years (py) of follow-up were accrued (median: 58 mo; interquartile range 37\u201382 mo). Approximately 84.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 82.0\u201387.6) and 71.8% (95% CI: 68.2\u201375.6) of patients remained on AS at 3 and 5 yr, respectively. EFS and TFS were lower in those with MRI-visible (Likert 4\u20135) disease or secondary Gleason pattern 4 at baseline (log-rank test; p < 0.001). In total, 216 men were treated. There were 24 deaths, none of which was prostate cancer related (6.3/1000 py; 95% CI: 4.1\u20139.5). Metastases developed in eight men (2.1 events/1000 py; 95% CI: 1.0\u20134.3), whereas 27 men upgraded to Gleason \u22654 + 3 on follow-up biopsy (7.7 events/1000 py; 95% CI: 5.2\u201311.3). Conclusions: The rates of discontinuation, mortality, and metastasis in MRI-led surveillance are comparable with those of standard AS. MRI-visible disease and/or secondary Gleason grade 4 at baseline are associated with a greater likelihood of moving to active treatment at 5 yr. Further research will concentrate on optimising imaging intervals according to baseline risk. Patient summary: In this report, we looked at the outcomes of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based surveillance for prostate cancer in a UK cohort. We found that this strategy could allow routine biopsies to be avoided. Secondary Gleason pattern 4 and MRI visibility are associated with increased rates of treatment. We conclude that MRI-based surveillance should be considered for the monitoring of small prostate tumours. We report excellent clinical outcomes from one of the largest imaging-based active surveillance cohorts to date. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-visible cancer at baseline, along with 3 + 4 Gleason grade, predicts a greater likelihood of treatment at five years. MRI-visible lesions appear to have a distinct clinical trajectory from less conspicuous ones.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Active surveillance", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Prostate cancer"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084093542", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"43761516900": {"Name": "Stavrinides V.", "AuthorID": "43761516900", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55646665800": {"Name": "Giganti F.", "AuthorID": "55646665800", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "17036141700": {"Name": "Punwani S.", "AuthorID": "17036141700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "54382137700": {"Name": "McCartan N.", "AuthorID": "54382137700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "57211975112": {"Name": "Whitaker H.", "AuthorID": "57211975112", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "55199046500": {"Name": "Orczyk C.", "AuthorID": "55199046500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004667094": {"Name": "Emberton M.", "AuthorID": "7004667094", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7402982572": {"Name": "Moore C.M.", "AuthorID": "7402982572", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7402266611": {"Name": "Allen C.", "AuthorID": "7402266611", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "15053220400": {"Name": "Kirkham A.", "AuthorID": "15053220400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35392109800": {"Name": "Trock B.", "AuthorID": "35392109800", "AffiliationID": "60006433, 60005248", "AffiliationName": "Division of Epidemiology, James Buchanan Brady Urological Institute, Johns Hopkins University"}, "8972541300": {"Name": "Freeman A.", "AuthorID": "8972541300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57205198360": {"Name": "Haider A.", "AuthorID": "57205198360", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57212561286": {"Name": "Ball R.", "AuthorID": "57212561286", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
