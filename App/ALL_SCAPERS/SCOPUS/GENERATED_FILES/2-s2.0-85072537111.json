Two types of pump excitation were employed, one in the infrared (IR) (0.95 eV) and the other in the ultraviolet (UV) (3.5 eV) region. With IR excitation, electrons associated with defects are excited into the bottom of the conduction band from the polaronic states within the band gap, which are retrapped within 45 \u00b1 10 fs. Under UV excitation, the electrons in these band-gap states (BGSs) and valence-band electrons are excited into the conduction band. In addition to the fast polaron trapping observed with IR excitation, we also observe a long lifetime (\u223c1 ps) component for both the depletion of hot electrons at the bottom of the conduction band and the refilling of the BGS. This points to a BGS-mediated recombination process with a picosecond lifetime.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Charge carrier recombination", "Charge carrier trapping", "Polaronic state", "Pump excitation", "Recombination process", "State selective", "Time resolved pump probes", "Valence-band electrons"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072537111", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57160580000": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "57160580000", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Central Laser Facility, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "57213869075": {"Name": "Payne D.T.", "AuthorID": "57213869075", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "7201425162": {"Name": "Pang C.L.", "AuthorID": "7201425162", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "7003283537": {"Name": "Fielding H.H.", "AuthorID": "7003283537", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57196232691": {"Name": "Thornton G.", "AuthorID": "57196232691", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "11339378400": {"Name": "Cacho C.", "AuthorID": "11339378400", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Central Laser Facility, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "25924264000": {"Name": "Chapman R.T.", "AuthorID": "25924264000", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Central Laser Facility, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "6701329344": {"Name": "Springate E.", "AuthorID": "6701329344", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Central Laser Facility, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}}}
