As researchers working on such topics are moving to learn from the nature of micro-expression, the practice of using deep learning techniques has evolved from processing the entire video clip of micro-expression to the recognition on apex frame. Using the apex frame is able to get rid of redundant video frames, but the relevant temporal evidence of micro-expression would be thereby left out. This paper proposes a novel Apex-Time Network (ATNet)to recognize micro-expression based on spatial information from the apex frame as well as on temporal information from the respective-adjacent frames. Through extensive experiments on three benchmarks, we demonstrate the improvement achieved by learning such temporal information. Specially, the model with such temporal information is more robust in cross-dataset validations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deep learning", "Feature fusion", "Micro-expression", "Neural network"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adjacent frames", "Automatic recognition", "Feature fusion", "Learning approach", "Learning techniques", "Micro-expressions", "Spatial informations", "Temporal information"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077787385", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"], ["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"]], "AuthorData": {"57191359109": {"Name": "Peng M.", "AuthorID": "57191359109", "AffiliationID": "119888077", "AffiliationName": "Intelligent Security Center, Chongqing Institute of Green and Intelligent Technology"}, "57213417833": {"Name": "Shi Y.", "AuthorID": "57213417833", "AffiliationID": "119888077", "AffiliationName": "Intelligent Security Center, Chongqing Institute of Green and Intelligent Technology"}, "57191432161": {"Name": "Zhou X.", "AuthorID": "57191432161", "AffiliationID": "119888077", "AffiliationName": "Intelligent Security Center, Chongqing Institute of Green and Intelligent Technology"}, "57202807310": {"Name": "Wang C.", "AuthorID": "57202807310", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College London"}, "57209399116": {"Name": "Bi T.", "AuthorID": "57209399116", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College London"}, "57201241944": {"Name": "Chen T.", "AuthorID": "57201241944", "AffiliationID": "60122052", "AffiliationName": "College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Southwest University"}}}
