We show that mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) can be used to prospectively isolate chronologically old HSCs with transcriptional features and functional attributes characteristic of young HSCs, including a high rate of transcription and balanced lineage-affiliated programs. Strikingly, MMP is a stronger determinant of the quantitative and qualitative transcriptional state of HSCs than chronological age, and transcriptional consequences of manipulation of MMP in HSCs within their native niche suggest a causal relationship. Accordingly, we show that pharmacological enhancement of MMP in old HSCs in vivo increases engraftment potential upon transplantation and reverses myeloid-biased peripheral blood output at steady state. Our results demonstrate that MMP is a source of heterogeneity in old HSCs, and its pharmacological manipulation can alter transcriptional programs with beneficial consequences for function.\u00a9 2020 The AuthorsHSC aging is clinically associated with risk of anemia, immune compromise, and malignancy. Mansell et al. show that mitochondrial activity is directly linked to age-related performance of HSCs and that its perturbation has direct consequences for HSC function, resulting in alleviation or prevention of hematopoietic aging.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aging", "Hematopoietc Stem Cell", "Lineage bias", "Mitochondria", "Mitochondrial Membrane Potential", "Mitoquinol", "Transcription Rate"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095443376", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57207771645": {"Name": "Mansell E.", "AuthorID": "57207771645", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "15842441900": {"Name": "Sigurdsson V.", "AuthorID": "15842441900", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Lund University"}, "13605180200": {"Name": "Miharada K.", "AuthorID": "13605180200", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Lund University"}, "57196448009": {"Name": "Larsson J.", "AuthorID": "57196448009", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Lund University"}, "7006621281": {"Name": "Enver T.", "AuthorID": "7006621281", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "46661065600": {"Name": "Deltcheva E.", "AuthorID": "46661065600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "55605766343": {"Name": "Brown J.", "AuthorID": "55605766343", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57203032477": {"Name": "James C.", "AuthorID": "57203032477", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "9233729200": {"Name": "Soneji S.", "AuthorID": "9233729200", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Hematology, Lund University"}}}
