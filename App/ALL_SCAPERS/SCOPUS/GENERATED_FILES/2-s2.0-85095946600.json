This paper investigates the role of securitisation in populism, exploring how the populist mode of securitising differs from traditional securitisation processes. It argues that securitisation is inherently embedded in populism which embodies a particular style of securitisation with a distinct set of discursive and aesthetic repertoires. The populist invocation of societal security and their claim to defend the fundamentally precarious identity of \u2018the endangered people\u2019 necessitate an unceasing construction of new threats. Aiming to discredit \u2018elitist\u2019 securitisation processes, populism invests in a specific construction of the referent object, the securitising actor and their relationship to the audience. The populist securitising style also carries a distinctive aesthetic centred on \u2018poor taste\u2019, sentimental ordinariness and unprofessionalism, examining which can widen our understanding of the aesthetics of security.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aesthetics", "populism", "securitisation", "societal security", "style"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095946600", "SubjectAreas": [["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"57193310099": {"Name": "Kurylo B.", "AuthorID": "57193310099", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
