The study of bipartite Ramsey numbers was initiated over 40 years ago by Faudree and Schelp and, independently, by Gy\u00e1rf\u00e1s and Lehel, who determined the 2-colour bipartite Ramsey number of paths. Recently the 3- colour Ramsey number of paths and (even) cycles, was essentially determined as well. Improving the results of DeBiasio, Gy\u00e1rf\u00e1s, Krueger, Ruszink\u00f3, and S\u00e1rk\u00f6zy, in this paper we determine asymptotically the 4-colour bipartite Ramsey number of paths and cycles. We also provide new upper bounds on the k-colour bipartite Ramsey numbers of paths and cycles which are close to being tight.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073589475", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Geometry and Topology", "MATH", "2608"], ["Discrete Mathematics and Combinatorics", "MATH", "2607"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"57195280517": {"Name": "Buci\u0107 M.", "AuthorID": "57195280517", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, ETH"}, "55227074100": {"Name": "Letzter S.", "AuthorID": "55227074100", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "ETH Institute for Theoretical Studies, ETH"}}}
