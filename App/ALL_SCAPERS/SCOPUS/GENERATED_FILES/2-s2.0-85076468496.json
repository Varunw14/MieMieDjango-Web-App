Propagation of optical pulses in a photonic system consisting of two photonic crystal cavities coupled to a photonic crystal waveguide operating in the slow-light regime is analyzed. Moreover, the influence of different parameters on pulse dynamics is investigated, including the separation between cavities, the distance between the cavities and the waveguide, and the input pulse width.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coupledmode theory", "Kerr effect", "Optical filters", "Photonic crystals cavities", "Photonic crystals waveguides", "Silicon", "Slow-light"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cavity-waveguide coupling", "Computational model", "Coupled-mode theory", "Nonlinear interactions", "Photonic crystal cavities", "Photonic crystal waveguide", "Two photon absorption", "Waveguide dispersions"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076468496", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57212351504": {"Name": "Fernandez Laguna V.", "AuthorID": "57212351504", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57203316923": {"Name": "Ren Q.", "AuthorID": "57203316923", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004097868": {"Name": "Panoiu N.", "AuthorID": "7004097868", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
