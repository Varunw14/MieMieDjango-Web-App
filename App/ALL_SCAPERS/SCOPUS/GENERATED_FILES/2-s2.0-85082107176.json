Hepatology published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc., on behalf of American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.Background and Aims: Genetically modified mice have been used extensively to study human disease. However, the data gained are not always translatable to humans because of major species differences. Liver-humanized mice (LHM) are considered a promising model to study human hepatic and systemic metabolism. Therefore, we aimed to further explore their lipoprotein metabolism and to characterize key hepatic species-related, physiological differences. Approach and Results: Fah\u2212/\u2212, Rag2\u2212/\u2212, and Il2rg\u2212/\u2212 knockout mice on the nonobese diabetic (FRGN) background were repopulated with primary human hepatocytes from different donors. Cholesterol lipoprotein profiles of LHM showed a human-like pattern, characterized by a high ratio of low-density lipoprotein to high-density lipoprotein, and dependency on the human donor. This pattern was determined by a higher level of apolipoprotein B100 in circulation, as a result of lower hepatic mRNA editing and low-density lipoprotein receptor expression, and higher levels of circulating proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9. As a consequence, LHM lipoproteins bind to human aortic proteoglycans in a pattern similar to human lipoproteins. Unexpectedly, cholesteryl ester transfer protein was not required to determine the human-like cholesterol lipoprotein profile. Moreover, LHM treated with GW3965 mimicked the negative lipid outcomes of the first human trial of liver X receptor stimulation (i.e., a dramatic increase of cholesterol and triglycerides in circulation). Innovatively, LHM allowed the characterization of these effects at a molecular level. Conclusions: LHM represent an interesting translatable model of human hepatic and lipoprotein metabolism. Because several metabolic parameters displayed donor dependency, LHM may also be used in studies for personalized medicine.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082107176", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"]], "AuthorData": {"57205133865": {"Name": "Minniti M.E.", "AuthorID": "57205133865", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Division of Clinical Chemistry, Karolinska Institute"}, "24721562900": {"Name": "Pedrelli M.", "AuthorID": "24721562900", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Division of Clinical Chemistry, Karolinska Institute"}, "26432864500": {"Name": "Vedin L.L.", "AuthorID": "26432864500", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Division of Clinical Chemistry, Karolinska Institute"}, "16052588800": {"Name": "Garagnani P.", "AuthorID": "16052588800", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental, Diagnostic, and Specialty Medicine, and \u201cL.
