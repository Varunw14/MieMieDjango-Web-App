In the 1920\u2019s, these were identified as a new species of sauropod, Ornithopsis greppini, before being reclassified as a species of Cetiosauriscus (C. greppini), otherwise known from the type species (C. stewarti) from the late Middle Jurassic (Callovian) of the UK. The syntype of \u201cC. greppini\u201d consists of skeletal elements from all body regions, and at least four individuals of different sizes can be distinguished. Here we fully re-describe this material, and re-evaluate its taxonomy and systematic placement. The Moutier locality also yielded a theropod tooth, and fragmentary cranial and vertebral remains of a crocodylomorph, also re-described here. \u201cC.\u201d greppini is a small-sized (not more than 10 m long) non-neosauropod eusauropod. Cetiosauriscus stewarti and \u201cC.\u201d greppini differ from each other in: (1) size; (2) the neural spine morphology and diapophyseal laminae of the anterior caudal vertebrae; (3) the length-to-height proportion in the middle caudal vertebrae; (4) the presence or absence of ridges and crests on the middle caudal centra; and (5) the shape and proportions of the coracoid, humerus, and femur. These anatomical differences, combined with their discrepancy in stratigraphic age, make it unlikely that C. stewarti and \u201cC.\u201d greppini belong to the same genus, as also supported through our phylogenetic analysis. \u201cC.\u201d greppini cannot be assigned to any other contemporaneous sauropod taxon from Europe, but is diagnosed by an autapomorphic rugosity on the posteromedial margin of the humerus, as well as a unique combination of features. As such, we erect the new genus name Amanzia for the Swiss taxon \u201cOrnithopsis\u201d greppini, augmenting the growing diversity of Late Jurassic European sauropods. Our phylogenetic analysis places it outside of Neosauropoda, either as the sister taxon to that clade, or as a member of Turiasauria.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dinosauria", "Europe", "Late Jurassic", "Mesozoic", "Neosauropoda", "Palaeontology", "Switzerland"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079740060", "SubjectAreas": [["Geology", "EART", "1907"]], "AuthorData": {"7102731251": {"Name": "Schwarz D.", "AuthorID": "7102731251", "AffiliationID": "60072319", "AffiliationName": "Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde, Leibniz Institute for Evolution and Biodiversity Science"}, "25632385300": {"Name": "Mannion P.D.", "AuthorID": "25632385300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "57204232694": {"Name": "Wings O.", "AuthorID": "57204232694", "AffiliationID": "60014059", "AffiliationName": "Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Natural Sciences Collections"}, "57210537718": {"Name": "Meyer C.A.", "AuthorID": "57210537718", "AffiliationID": "60023588", "AffiliationName": "Department of Environmental Sciences, University of Basel"}}}
