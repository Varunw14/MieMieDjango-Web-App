X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), hot probe, Hall effect, and surface photovoltage spectroscopy showed films and crystals synthesized from the Sb2Se3 granulate material to be n-type with chlorine identified as an unintentional n-type dopant via secondary ion mass spectrometry analysis. The validity of chlorine as a dopant was confirmed by the synthesis of intrinsic crystals from metallic precursors and subsequent deliberate n-type doping by the addition of MgCl2. Chlorine was also shown to be a substitutional n-type shallow dopant by density functional theory calculations. TiO2/Sb2Se3 n-n isotype heterojunction solar cells with 7.3% efficiency are subsequently demonstrated, with band alignment analyzed via XPS.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Band alignments", "Bulk crystals", "Complementary techniques", "Isotype heterojunctions", "Metallic precursor", "N-type dopants", "n-Type doping", "Surface photovoltage spectroscopy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082684553", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57205259504": {"Name": "Hobson T.D.C.", "AuthorID": "57205259504", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Stephenson Institute for Renewable Energy, University of Liverpool"}, "18336304300": {"Name": "Phillips L.J.", "AuthorID": "18336304300", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Stephenson Institute for Renewable Energy, University of Liverpool"}, "55307564100": {"Name": "Hutter O.S.", "AuthorID": "55307564100", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Stephenson Institute for Renewable Energy, University of Liverpool"}, "57205163396": {"Name": "Shiel H.", "AuthorID": "57205163396", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Stephenson Institute for Renewable Energy, University of Liverpool"}, "57197829029": {"Name": "Swallow J.E.N.", "AuthorID": "57197829029", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Stephenson Institute for Renewable Energy, University of Liverpool"}, "7005679653": {"Name": "Mariotti S.", "AuthorID": "7005679653", "AffiliationID": "60102125, 60106839, 60106835", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Chimie des Polym\u00e8res Organiques, Bordeaux INP, Universit\u00e9 de Bordeaux"}, "57205073603": {"Name": "Jones L.A.H.", "AuthorID": "57205073603", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Stephenson Institute for Renewable Energy, University of Liverpool"}, "57197835439": {"Name": "Featherstone T.J.", "AuthorID": "57197835439", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Stephenson Institute for Renewable Energy, University of Liverpool"}, "57215779562": {"Name": "Smiles M.J.", "AuthorID": "57215779562", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Stephenson Institute for Renewable Energy, University of Liverpool"}, "7005578699": {"Name": "Dhanak V.R.", "AuthorID": "7005578699", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Stephenson Institute for Renewable Energy, University of Liverpool"}, "56216953800": {"Name": "Durose K.", "AuthorID": "56216953800", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Stephenson Institute for Renewable Energy, University of Liverpool"}, "6603739582": {"Name": "Veal T.D.", "AuthorID": "6603739582", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Stephenson Institute for Renewable Energy, University of Liverpool"}, "16239220700": {"Name": "Major J.D.", "AuthorID": "16239220700", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Stephenson Institute for Renewable Energy, University of Liverpool"}, "56545348200": {"Name": "Savory C.N.", "AuthorID": "56545348200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175885", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Young Centre, University College London"}, "16647397400": {"Name": "Scanlon D.O.", "AuthorID": "16647397400", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd., Diamond House, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "7102623421": {"Name": "Nayak P.K.", "AuthorID": "7102623421", "AffiliationID": "60117289", "AffiliationName": "TIFR Centre for Interdisciplinary Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research"}, "8833978100": {"Name": "Snaith H.J.", "AuthorID": "8833978100", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Clarendon Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Oxford"}, "57217373448": {"Name": "Das B.", "AuthorID": "57217373448", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, University of Minnesota"}, "7006523362": {"Name": "Leighton C.", "AuthorID": "7006523362", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, University of Minnesota"}, "36462541400": {"Name": "Bowen L.", "AuthorID": "36462541400", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "G.
