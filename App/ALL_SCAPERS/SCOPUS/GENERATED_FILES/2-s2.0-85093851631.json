We consider two recent versions of Morrill\u2019s calculi, and focus on their fragments including multiplicative (Lambek) connectives, additive conjunction and disjunction, brackets and bracket modalities, and the ! subexponential modality. For both systems, we resolve issues connected with the cut rule and provide necessary modifications, after which we prove admissibility of cut (cut elimination theorem). We also prove algorithmic undecidability for both calculi, and show that categorial grammars based on them can generate arbitrary recursively enumerable languages.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bracket modalities", "Categorial grammars", "cut elimination", "Lambek calculus", "Subexponential modalities", "Undecidability"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85093851631", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (miscellaneous)", "COMP", "1701"], ["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"56117921300": {"Name": "Kanovich M.", "AuthorID": "56117921300", "AffiliationID": "60029374", "AffiliationName": "Steklov Mathematical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "54914981600": {"Name": "Kuznetsov S.", "AuthorID": "54914981600", "AffiliationID": "60020513", "AffiliationName": "National Research University Higher School of Economics"}, "6701808416": {"Name": "Scedrov A.", "AuthorID": "6701808416", "AffiliationID": "60020513", "AffiliationName": "National Research University Higher School of Economics (until July 2020)"}}}
