RECENT FINDINGS: Objective measurement tools such as ccardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and muscle-specific ultrasound show great promise to assess/treat post-ICU physical dysfunction. CPET is showing that systemic mitochondrial dysfunction may underlie development and persistence of poor post-ICU functional recovery. Finally, recent data indicate that we are poor at delivering effective, early ICU rehabilitation and that there is limited benefit of currently employed later ICU rehabilitation on ICU-acquired weakness and QoL outcomes. SUMMARY: The combination of nutrition with effective, early rehabilitation is highly likely to be essential to optimize muscle mass/strength and physical function in ICU survivors. Currently, technologies such as muscle-specific ultrasound and CPET testing show great promise to guide ICU muscle/functional recovery. Further, we must evolve improved ICU-rehabilitation strategies, as current methods are not consistently improving outcomes. In conclusion, we must continue to look to other areas of medicine and to athletes if we hope to ultimately improve 'ICU Survivorship'.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Critical Illness", "Exercise", "Humans", "Intensive Care Units", "Quality of Life", "Survivors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087531173", "SubjectAreas": [["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"]], "AuthorData": {"57202002087": {"Name": "Molinger J.", "AuthorID": "57202002087", "AffiliationID": "60032114, 60022265", "AffiliationName": "Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Erasmus MC, Erasmus University Rotterdam"}, "47761759900": {"Name": "Whittle J.", "AuthorID": "47761759900", "AffiliationID": "60005200", "AffiliationName": "Duke University School of Medicine, Department of Anesthesiology, Center for Perioperative Organ Protection (CPOP), Duke Human Pharmacology and Physiology Lab (HPPL)"}, "6603692931": {"Name": "Wischmeyer P.E.", "AuthorID": "6603692931", "AffiliationID": "60005200", "AffiliationName": "Duke University School of Medicine, Department of Anesthesiology, Center for Perioperative Organ Protection (CPOP), Duke Human Pharmacology and Physiology Lab (HPPL)"}, "8669541000": {"Name": "Pastva A.M.", "AuthorID": "8669541000", "AffiliationID": "60005200, 60008724", "AffiliationName": "Duke University School of Medicine, Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Division of Physical Therapy, Duke Claude D.
