The method is referred to as Niching MG-PMA, where MG refers to multi-gene and PMA to parameter mapping approach. Although it was designed to be a multimodal optimization method, recent tests have revealed its suitability for unimodal optimization. The definition of Niching MG-PMA is provided in a detailed fashion, along with an in-depth explanation of two novelties in our implementation: the feedback of initial parameters and the domain constraints using periodic boundary conditions. These ideas can be potentially useful for other optimization techniques. The method is tested on the basis of the CEC\u20192015 benchmark functions. Statistical analysis shows that Niching MG-PMA performs similarly to the winners of the competition even without any parametrization towards the benchmark, indicating that the method is robust and applicable to a wide range of problems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Evolutionary computation", "Genetic programming", "Niching methods", "Optimization", "Parameter mapping approach", "Periodic boundary conditions"], "IndexKeywords": ["Benchmark functions", "Multi-modal optimization", "Niching methods", "Niching strategies", "Optimization method", "Optimization techniques", "Parameter mapping approach", "Periodic boundary conditions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076922834", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"57204593537": {"Name": "P\u00f3voa R.C.B.L.", "AuthorID": "57204593537", "AffiliationID": "123683804", "AffiliationName": "Apparat AS"}, "55822854400": {"Name": "Koshiyama A.S.", "AuthorID": "55822854400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "15055697700": {"Name": "Dias D.M.", "AuthorID": "15055697700", "AffiliationID": "60005499", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, Rio de Janeiro State University"}, "22936328900": {"Name": "Souza P.L.", "AuthorID": "22936328900", "AffiliationID": "60032361", "AffiliationName": "LabSem/CETUC, Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro"}, "8605965900": {"Name": "Horta B.A.C.", "AuthorID": "8605965900", "AffiliationID": "108037297", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemistry, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro"}}}
