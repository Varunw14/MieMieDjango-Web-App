We used three English national population surveys of psychiatric morbidity from 2000, 2007 and 2014 to provide prevalence rates for recent psychiatric problems. We combined disorders progressively to demonstrate the effects of cumulation. Psychosis had a prevalence of around 1%, severe common mental disorders added about 8%, and including less-severe common mental disorders gave a value around one in six. The figure of one in four required the inclusion of various other disorders. These values were strikingly stable over the surveys.", "AuthorKeywords": ["epidemiology", "Mental disorders", "national survey", "prevalence", "temporal change"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076969118", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57204025589": {"Name": "Bebbington P.E.", "AuthorID": "57204025589", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "7005298792": {"Name": "McManus S.", "AuthorID": "7005298792", "AffiliationID": "60120458", "AffiliationName": "Survey Research Centre, National Centre for Social Research"}}}
