This study aimed to investigate whether lack of dose to subclinical disease is associated with increased disease progression by using high-quality prostate radiation therapy clinical trial data to identify anatomically localized regions where dose variation is associated with prostate-specific antigen progression (PSAP). Methods and Materials: Planned dose distributions for 683 patients of the Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group 03.04 Randomized Androgen Deprivation and Radiotherapy (RADAR) trial were deformably registered onto a single exemplar computed tomography data set. These were divided into high-risk and intermediate-risk subgroups for analysis. Three independent voxel-based statistical tests, using permutation testing, Cox regression modeling, and least absolute shrinkage selection operator feature selection, were applied to identify regions where dose variation was associated with PSAP. Results from the intermediate-risk RADAR subgroup were externally validated by registering dose distributions from the RT01 (n = 388) and Conventional or Hypofractionated High Dose Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer Trial (CHHiP) (n = 253) trials onto the same exemplar and repeating the tests on each of these data sets. Results: Voxel-based Cox regression revealed regions where reduced dose was correlated with increased prostate-specific androgen progression. Reduced dose in regions associated with coverage at the posterior prostate, in the immediate periphery of the posterior prostate, and in regions corresponding to the posterior oblique beams or posterior lateral beam boundary, was associated with increased PSAP for RADAR and RT01 patients, but not for CHHiP patients. Reduced dose to the seminal vesicle region was also associated with increased PSAP for RADAR intermediate-risk patients. Conclusions: Ensuring adequate dose coverage at the posterior prostate and immediately surrounding posterior region (including the seminal vesicles), where aggressive cancer spread may be occurring, may improve tumor control. It is recommended that particular care be taken when defining margins at the prostate posterior, acknowledging the trade-off between quality of life due to rectal dose and the preferences of clinicians and patients.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Androgen deprivation", "Computed tomography data", "Disease progression", "Methods and materials", "Permutation testing", "Prostate specific antigen", "Selection operators", "Voxel-based analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089912494", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"57196438995": {"Name": "Marcello M.", "AuthorID": "57196438995", "AffiliationID": "60025898", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital"}, "7102930487": {"Name": "Ebert M.A.", "AuthorID": "7102930487", "AffiliationID": "122451051", "AffiliationName": "5D Clinics, Claremont"}, "55903994300": {"Name": "Kennedy A.", "AuthorID": "55903994300", "AffiliationID": "60025898", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital"}, "7005621053": {"Name": "Denham J.W.", "AuthorID": "7005621053", "AffiliationID": "60183191, 60010571", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Newcastle"}, "7003834326": {"Name": "Haworth A.", "AuthorID": "7003834326", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics, University of Sydney"}, "9334250200": {"Name": "Steigler A.", "AuthorID": "9334250200", "AffiliationID": "60183191, 60010571", "AffiliationName": "Prostate Cancer Trials Group, School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Newcastle"}, "57204782270": {"Name": "Greer P.B.", "AuthorID": "57204782270", "AffiliationID": "60101515", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Calvary Mater Newcastle"}, "57210097371": {"Name": "Dowling J.A.", "AuthorID": "57210097371", "AffiliationID": "60029470", "AffiliationName": "CSIRO"}, "7102473157": {"Name": "Holloway L.C.", "AuthorID": "7102473157", "AffiliationID": "60011664", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Radiation Physics, University of Wollongong"}, "36622573000": {"Name": "Jameson M.G.", "AuthorID": "36622573000", "AffiliationID": "60111268", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research Team, Ingham Institute for Applied Medical Research"}, "57200626950": {"Name": "Roach D.", "AuthorID": "57200626950", "AffiliationID": "60111268", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research Team, Ingham Institute for Applied Medical Research"}, "7202297011": {"Name": "Joseph D.J.", "AuthorID": "7202297011", "AffiliationID": "113496034", "AffiliationName": "GenesisCare WA"}, "19034231400": {"Name": "Gulliford S.L.", "AuthorID": "19034231400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004428943": {"Name": "Dearnaley D.P.", "AuthorID": "7004428943", "AffiliationID": "60017166, 60010337", "AffiliationName": "Academic UroOncology Unit, The Institute of Cancer Research and the Royal Marsden NHS Trust"}, "55836382400": {"Name": "Sydes M.R.", "AuthorID": "55836382400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology, University College London"}, "7401767852": {"Name": "Hall E.", "AuthorID": "7401767852", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Trials and Statistics Unit, The Institute of Cancer Research"}}}
