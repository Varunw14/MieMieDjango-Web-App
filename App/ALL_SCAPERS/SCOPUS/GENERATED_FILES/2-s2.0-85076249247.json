Extended fundamental process understanding could be gained with the use of an ultra scale-down (USD) device using as little as 1.7 mL per experimental run. The USD system is used to predict diafiltration and ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UF/DF) performance of a pilot-scale tangential flow filtration (TFF) system, fitted with a flat-sheet cassette, operating at 500-fold larger scale. Both systems were designed by maintaining a volumetric loading of 8.1 L of feed per m2. Permeate flux was predicted for monoclonal antibody solutions with the USD system across a range of transmembrane pressure drops, feed concentrations and flow conditions during diafiltration, and desired retentate concentrations during UF/DF operations. The resulting USD data were in good agreement with the pilot-scale TFF when scaled based on similar shear rates over the membrane surface. Little change in soluble aggregates was observed in both systems but there were significantly higher increases in product turbidity in the USD system. A correlation was established to relate turbidity increase based on the volume fraction of high shear stress zone for USD systems and various pilot-scale TFF systems. The correlation was extended to encompass the processing time and concentration for a wide range of membrane processing challenges in both scales.", "AuthorKeywords": ["High monoclonal antibody concentration", "Protein aggregation", "Tangential flow filtration", "Ultra scale-down", "Ultrafiltration/diafiltration"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antibody concentration", "Bioprocess development", "Protein aggregation", "Tangential flow filtrations", "Tangential flow filtrations (TFF)", "Transmembrane pressure drop", "Ultra scale down (USD)", "Ultra scale-down"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076249247", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Filtration and Separation", "CENG", "1506"]], "AuthorData": {"57205317637": {"Name": "Fernandez-Cerezo L.", "AuthorID": "57205317637", "AffiliationID": "60007995", "AffiliationName": "Downstream Process Engineering and Development, Merck & Co., Inc"}, "37004599600": {"Name": "Rayat A.C.M.E.", "AuthorID": "37004599600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, Department of Biochemical Engineering, UCL"}, "55151375000": {"Name": "Chatel A.", "AuthorID": "55151375000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, Department of Biochemical Engineering, UCL"}, "7004669230": {"Name": "Lye G.J.", "AuthorID": "7004669230", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, Department of Biochemical Engineering, UCL"}, "7005413875": {"Name": "Hoare M.", "AuthorID": "7005413875", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, Department of Biochemical Engineering, UCL"}, "12040061200": {"Name": "Pollard J.M.", "AuthorID": "12040061200", "AffiliationID": "60007995", "AffiliationName": "Downstream Process Engineering and Development, Merck & Co., Inc"}}}
