Medications are known to increase the risk of falls in older adults. The debate about reducing the number of prescribed medications remains controversial, and more evidence is needed to understand the relationship between polypharmacy and fall-related hospital admissions. We examined the effect of polypharmacy on hospitalization due to a fall, using a large nationally representative sample of older adults. Methods: Data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) were used. We included 6220 participants aged 50+ with valid data collected between 2012 and 2018.The main outcome measure was hospital admission due to a fall. Polypharmacy -the number of long-term prescription drugs- was the main exposure coded as: no medications, 1\u20134 medications, 5\u20139 medications (polypharmacy) and 10+ medications (heightened polypharmacy). Competing-risk regression analysis was used (with death as a potential competing risk), adjusted for common confounders, including multi-morbidity and fall risk-increasing drugs. Results: The prevalence of people admitted to hospital due to a fall increased according to the number of medications taken, from 1.5% of falls for people reporting no medications, to 4.7% of falls among those taking 1\u20134 medications, 7.9% of falls among those with polypharmacy and 14.8% among those reporting heightened polypharmacy. Fully adjusted SHRs for hospitalization due to a fall among people who reported taking 1\u20134 medications, polypharmacy and heightened polypharmacy were 1.79 (1.18; 2.71), 1.75 (1.04; 2.95), and 3.19 (1.61; 6.32) respectively, compared with people who were not taking medications. Conclusions: The risk of hospitalization due to a fall increased with polypharmacy. It is suggested that prescriptions in older people should be revised on a regular basis, and that the number of medications prescribed be kept to a minimum, in order to reduce the risk of fall-related hospital admissions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Falls", "Hospitalization", "Older people", "Polypharmacy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096518661", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"24072448700": {"Name": "Zaninotto P.", "AuthorID": "24072448700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "57220040003": {"Name": "Huang Y.T.", "AuthorID": "57220040003", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "56038134700": {"Name": "Di Gessa G.", "AuthorID": "56038134700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "35798512000": {"Name": "Lassale C.", "AuthorID": "35798512000", "AffiliationID": "60023506, 60000100", "AffiliationName": "Programme of Epidemiology and Public Health, Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute (IMIM)"}, "35232280800": {"Name": "Abell J.", "AuthorID": "35232280800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioral Science and Health, University College London"}, "7102289942": {"Name": "Steptoe A.", "AuthorID": "7102289942", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioral Science and Health, University College London"}}}
