We quantify radiological RILD longitudinally and correlate it with dosimetry and respiratory morbidity. Materials and methods: CTs were available pre-RT and at 3, 6, 12 and 24-months post-RT for forty-five subjects enrolled in a phase 1/2 clinical trial of isotoxic, dose-escalated chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Fifteen CT-based measures of parenchymal, pleural and lung volume change, and anatomical distortions, were calculated. Respiratory morbidity was assessed with the Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnoea score and spirometric pulmonary function tests (PFTs): FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC and DLCO. Results: FEV1, FEV1/FVC and MRC scores progressively declined post-RT; FVC decreased by 6-months before partially recovering. Radiologically, an early phase (3\u20136 months) of acute inflammation was characterised by reversible parenchymal change and non-progressive anatomical distortion. A phase of chronic scarring followed (6\u201324 months) with irreversible parenchymal change, progressive volume loss and anatomical distortion. Post-RT increase in contralateral lung volume was common. Normal lung volume shrinkage correlated longitudinally with mean lung dose (r = 0.30\u20130.40, p = 0.01\u20130.04). Radiological findings allowed separation of patients with predominant acute versus chronic RILD; subjects with predominantly chronic RILD had poorer pre-RT lung function. Conclusions: CT-based measures enable detailed quantification of the longitudinal evolution of RILD. The majority of patients developed progressive lung damage, even when the early phase was absent or mild. Pre-RT lung function and RT dosimetry may allow to identify subjects at increased risk of RILD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Computed tomography (CT)", "Lung", "Pulmonary function test (PFT)", "Radiation-induced lung damage (RILD)"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083694081", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"56047276000": {"Name": "Veiga C.", "AuthorID": "56047276000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, Department of Medical Physics & Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57202517377": {"Name": "Jacob J.", "AuthorID": "57202517377", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, University College London"}, "57216499194": {"Name": "Yip N.", "AuthorID": "57216499194", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, Department of Medical Physics & Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57193026172": {"Name": "Szmul A.", "AuthorID": "57193026172", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, Department of Medical Physics & Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "8757124700": {"Name": "McClelland J.R.", "AuthorID": "8757124700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, Department of Medical Physics & Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "6504681943": {"Name": "Chandy E.", "AuthorID": "6504681943", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "23479629300": {"Name": "Landau D.", "AuthorID": "23479629300", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Oncology, Guy's & St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
