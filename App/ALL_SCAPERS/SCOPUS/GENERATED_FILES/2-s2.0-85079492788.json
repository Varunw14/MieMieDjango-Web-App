Methods: A detailed review protocol was designed according to PRISMA guideline. Online search was conducted on PubMed, Cochrane library and Embase. Only randomized clinical trials (RCTs) testing MIS or MINST procedure, with or without the application of a regenerative tool for the treatment of intra-bony defect, were included. Cochrane checklist for risk of bias assessment was used. Network meta-Analysis (NMAs) was used to rank the treatment efficacy. Results: Nine RCTs accounting for 244 patients and a total of 244 defects were included. Only two studies were at low risk of bias. CAL gain for included treatment ranged from 2.58 \u00b1 1.13 mm to 4.7 \u00b1 2.5 mm while PPD reduction ranged from 3.19 \u00b1 0.71 mm to 5.3 \u00b1 1.5 mm. On the basis of the ranking curve, MINST showed the lowest probability to be the best treatment option for CAL gain. Pairwise comparisons and treatment rankings suggest superiority for regenerative approaches (CAL difference 0.78 mm, (0.14\u20131.41); P < 0.05) and surgical treatment elevating only the buccal or palatal flap (CAL difference: 0.95 mm, (0.33\u20131.57); P < 0.05). Conclusions: Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) and non-surgical (MINST) periodontal therapy show promising results in the treatment of residual pocket with intra-bony defect. Clinical relevance: MIS procedures represent a reliable treatment for isolated intra-bony defect.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Guided tissue regeneration", "Minimally invasive surgical procedures", "Periodontal pocket", "Periodontitis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alveolar Bone Loss", "Humans", "Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures", "Network Meta-Analysis", "Oral Surgical Procedures", "Periodontal Pocket", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079492788", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"56290927600": {"Name": "Barbato L.", "AuthorID": "56290927600", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Research Unit in Periodontology and Periodontal Medicine, University of Florence"}, "57208993245": {"Name": "Selvaggi F.", "AuthorID": "57208993245", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Research Unit in Periodontology and Periodontal Medicine, University of Florence"}, "56856801700": {"Name": "Bendinelli E.", "AuthorID": "56856801700", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Research Unit in Periodontology and Periodontal Medicine, University of Florence"}, "57214914692": {"Name": "Marca M.L.", "AuthorID": "57214914692", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Research Unit in Periodontology and Periodontal Medicine, University of Florence"}, "36092602800": {"Name": "Cairo F.", "AuthorID": "36092602800", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Research Unit in Periodontology and Periodontal Medicine, University of Florence"}, "56603166000": {"Name": "Kalemaj Z.", "AuthorID": "56603166000", "AffiliationID": "112710205", "AffiliationName": "Private Practice"}, "15842800000": {"Name": "Buti J.", "AuthorID": "15842800000", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Periodontology, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}}}
