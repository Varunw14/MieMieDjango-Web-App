Here we process Sentinel-3A waveform data to estimate Arctic sea level anomaly and radar freeboard from November 2017 to April 2018. We compare our results to those from the CryoSat-2 satellite, and find an intermission bias on sea-level anomaly of 2 cm. We also find a mean radar freeboard difference of 1 cm, which we attribute to the use of empirical retrackers to retrieve lead and floe elevations. Ahead of Sentinel-3B waveform data being made available, we use orbit files to estimate the improvement in sampling resolution afforded by the addition of Sentinel-3A and 3B data to the CryoSat-2 dataset. By combining data from the three satellites, grid resolution or time-sampling can be almost tripled compared with using CryoSat-2 data alone.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CryoSat-2", "Radar altimetry", "Radar freeboard", "Sea ice", "Sea-level anomaly", "Sentinel-3"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cryosat", "European Commission", "European Space Agency", "Grid resolution", "Radar altimetry", "Sampling resolution", "Sea level anomaly", "Sentinel-3"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074526272", "SubjectAreas": [["Aerospace Engineering", "ENGI", "2202"], ["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"55993841100": {"Name": "Lawrence I.", "AuthorID": "55993841100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling, Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "24330320400": {"Name": "Tsamados M.", "AuthorID": "24330320400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling, Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "6602079010": {"Name": "Stroeve J.", "AuthorID": "6602079010", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling, Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "16403028400": {"Name": "Ridout A.", "AuthorID": "16403028400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling, Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "13106177400": {"Name": "Muir A.", "AuthorID": "13106177400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling, Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "55966845700": {"Name": "Armitage T.", "AuthorID": "55966845700", "AffiliationID": "60009037, 60031581", "AffiliationName": "Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology"}, "21933619000": {"Name": "Dinardo S.", "AuthorID": "21933619000", "AffiliationID": "122809135", "AffiliationName": "HeSpace"}, "56763977200": {"Name": "Tilling R.", "AuthorID": "56763977200", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling, School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds"}, "36842807800": {"Name": "Shepherd A.", "AuthorID": "36842807800", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling, School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds"}}}
