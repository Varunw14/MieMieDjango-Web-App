These materials are typically porous solids, although the liquid state can be easier to manipulate in industrial settings. The idea of combining the size and shape selectivity of porous domains with the fluidity of liquids is a promising one and porous liquids composed of functionalized organic cages have recently attracted attention. Here we describe an ionic-liquid, porous, tetrahedral coordination cage. Complementing the gas binding observed in other porous liquids, this material also encapsulates non-gaseous guests\u2014shape and size selectivity was observed for a series of isomeric alcohols. Three gaseous chlorofluorocarbon guests, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorodifluoromethane and chlorotrifluoromethane, were also shown to be taken up by the liquid coordination cage with an affinity that increased with their size. We hope that these findings will lead to the synthesis of other porous liquids whose guest-uptake properties may be tailored to fulfil specific functions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079452278", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"57214892816": {"Name": "Ma L.", "AuthorID": "57214892816", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "35974995200": {"Name": "Haynes C.J.E.", "AuthorID": "35974995200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57000374100": {"Name": "Grommet A.B.", "AuthorID": "57000374100", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "57040899100": {"Name": "Parkins C.C.", "AuthorID": "57040899100", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "57214899037": {"Name": "Tron A.", "AuthorID": "57214899037", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "7006312850": {"Name": "Nitschke J.R.", "AuthorID": "7006312850", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "57195520973": {"Name": "Walczak A.", "AuthorID": "57195520973", "AffiliationID": "60014168", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Chemistry, Adam Mickiewicz University"}, "8917344500": {"Name": "Stefankiewicz A.R.", "AuthorID": "8917344500", "AffiliationID": "60014168", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Chemistry, Adam Mickiewicz University"}, "27867727600": {"Name": "Doherty C.M.", "AuthorID": "27867727600", "AffiliationID": "60029470", "AffiliationName": "Manufacturing, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation"}, "57196214794": {"Name": "Longley L.", "AuthorID": "57196214794", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy, University of Cambridge"}, "56438891500": {"Name": "Bennett T.D.", "AuthorID": "56438891500", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy, University of Cambridge"}}}
