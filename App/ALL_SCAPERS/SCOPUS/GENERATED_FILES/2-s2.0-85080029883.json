The evidence-base for effective interventions to address loneliness is inconclusive. This study aimed to explore how community-dwelling lonely older people in England manage their experiences of loneliness. Twenty eight community-dwelling older people identifying as lonely, based on responses to two loneliness measures (self-report and a standardised instrument), participated in in-depth interviews between 2013 and 2014. Fifteen lived alone. Thematic analysis of transcribed interviews was conducted by a multidisciplinary team including older people. Participants drew on a range of strategies to ameliorate their distress which had been developed over their lives and shaped according to individual coping styles and contexts. Strategies included physical engagement with the world beyond their home, using technologies, planning, and engagement with purpose in an \u2018outside world\u2019, and acceptance, endurance, revealing and hiding, positive attitude and motivation, and distraction within an \u2018inside world\u2019. Strategies of interests and hobbies, comparative thinking, religion and spirituality and use of alcohol straddled both the inside and outside worlds. Participants conveyed a personal responsibility for managing feelings of loneliness rather than relying on others. This study includes the experiences of those living with loneliness whilst also living with other people. When developing policy and practice responses to loneliness it is important to listen attentively to the views of those who may not be engaging with services designed for \u2018the lonely\u2019 and to consider their own strategies for managing it.", "AuthorKeywords": ["coping strategies", "loneliness", "Older people", "qualitative research"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85080029883", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatric Mental Health", "NURS", "2921"], ["Gerontology", "NURS", "2909"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"6507886105": {"Name": "Kharicha K.", "AuthorID": "6507886105", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "23050302300": {"Name": "Iliffe S.", "AuthorID": "23050302300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "57203175207": {"Name": "Walters K.", "AuthorID": "57203175207", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "57202296197": {"Name": "Manthorpe J.", "AuthorID": "57202296197", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Policy Research Unit on Health and Social Care Workforce, King's College London"}, "6701468194": {"Name": "Chew-Graham C.A.", "AuthorID": "6701468194", "AffiliationID": "60030210", "AffiliationName": "School of Primary, Community and Social Care, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Keele University"}, "16021209800": {"Name": "Cattan M.", "AuthorID": "16021209800", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Northumbria University"}, "57216098217": {"Name": "Goodman C.", "AuthorID": "57216098217", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Research in Public Health and Community Care, University of Hertfordshire"}, "57193408237": {"Name": "Kirby-Barr M.", "AuthorID": "57193408237", "AffiliationID": "121671596", "AffiliationName": "Patient and Public Involvement Member"}, "57193403642": {"Name": "Whitehouse J.H.", "AuthorID": "57193403642", "AffiliationID": "121671596", "AffiliationName": "Patient and Public Involvement Member"}}}
