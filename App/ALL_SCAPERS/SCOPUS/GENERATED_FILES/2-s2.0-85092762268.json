In particular, we assume the initial datum to be only measurable and we allow the diffusion coefficient to be locally Lipschitz-continuous. Moreover, we show, in a quantitative fashion, how the finiteness of the pth moment of solutions depends on the integrability of the initial datum, in the whole range p ]0,\u221e[. Lipschitz continuity of the solution map in pth moment is established, under a Lipschitz continuity assumption on the diffusion coefficient, in the even larger range p [0,\u221e[. A key role is played by an It\u00f4 formula for the square of the norm in the variational setting for processes satisfying minimal integrability conditions, which yields pathwise continuity of solutions. Moreover, we show how the regularity of the initial datum and of the diffusion coefficient improves the regularity of the solution and, if applicable, of the invariant measures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["invariant measures", "monotonicity methods", "singular drift", "Stochastic evolution equations", "variational approach"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092762268", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Mathematical Physics", "MATH", "2610"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"23097973700": {"Name": "Marinelli C.", "AuthorID": "23097973700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "57056210800": {"Name": "Scarpa L.", "AuthorID": "57056210800", "AffiliationID": "60025988", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Mathematics, University of Vienna"}}}
