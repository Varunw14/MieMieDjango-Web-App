Geostandards and Geoanalytical Research published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of the International Association of GeoanalystsThe development and application of geochemical techniques to identify redox conditions in modern and ancient aquatic environments has intensified over recent years. Iron (Fe) speciation has emerged as one of the most widely used procedures to distinguish different redox regimes in both the water column and sediments, and is the main technique used to identify oxic, ferruginous (anoxic, Fe(II) containing) and euxinic (anoxic, sulfidic) water column conditions. However, an international sediment reference material has never been developed. This has led to concern over the consistency of results published by the many laboratories that now utilise the technique. Here, we report an interlaboratory comparison of four Fe speciation reference materials for palaeoredox analysis, which span a range of compositions and reflect deposition under different redox conditions. We provide an update of extraction techniques used in Fe speciation and assess the effects of both test portion mass, and the use of different analytical procedures, on the quantification of different Fe fractions in sedimentary rocks. While atomic absorption spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry produced comparable Fe measurements for all extraction stages, the use of ferrozine consistently underestimated Fe in the extraction step targeting mixed ferrous\u2013ferric minerals such as magnetite. We therefore suggest that the use of ferrozine is discontinued for this Fe pool. Finally, we report the combined data of four independent Fe speciation laboratories to characterise the Fe speciation composition of the reference materials. These reference materials are available to the community to provide an essential validation of in-house Fe speciation measurements.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ancient sediments", "iron speciation", "reference materials", "sequential extraction", "total iron", "water column redox"], "IndexKeywords": ["Analytical procedure", "Atomic absorption spectroscopy", "Development and applications", "Extraction techniques", "Geochemical techniques", "Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry", "Interlaboratory comparison", "Speciation measurements"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087687838", "SubjectAreas": [["Geology", "EART", "1907"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"57212303234": {"Name": "Alcott L.J.", "AuthorID": "57212303234", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds"}, "57203210766": {"Name": "Krause A.J.", "AuthorID": "57203210766", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds"}, "57207201818": {"Name": "Xiong Y.", "AuthorID": "57207201818", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds"}, "57195136187": {"Name": "Hobson A.J.", "AuthorID": "57195136187", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds"}, "55802017200": {"Name": "Neve L.", "AuthorID": "55802017200", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds"}, "54412572000": {"Name": "Mills B.J.W.", "AuthorID": "54412572000", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds"}, "24391075700": {"Name": "M\u00e4rz C.", "AuthorID": "24391075700", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds"}, "7004422917": {"Name": "Poulton S.W.", "AuthorID": "7004422917", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds"}, "36468238800": {"Name": "Hammarlund E.U.", "AuthorID": "36468238800", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Translational Cancer Research, Lund University"}, "6507300963": {"Name": "Bjerrum C.J.", "AuthorID": "6507300963", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management, Section of Geology, University of Copenhagen"}, "23019627900": {"Name": "Scholz F.", "AuthorID": "23019627900", "AffiliationID": "60079129", "AffiliationName": "GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel"}, "22959132000": {"Name": "Schnetger B.", "AuthorID": "22959132000", "AffiliationID": "60020306", "AffiliationName": "ICBM, University of Oldenburg"}, "7004454536": {"Name": "Bekker A.", "AuthorID": "7004454536", "AffiliationID": "60029526", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, University of California"}}}
