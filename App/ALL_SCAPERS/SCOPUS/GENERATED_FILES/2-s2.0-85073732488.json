We hypothesised that children with SCA from West Africa had worse lung function than their counterparts from Europe. Methods This prospective cross-sectional study evaluated spirometry and anthropometry in black African individuals with SCA (haemoglobin phenotype SS) aged 6-18 years from Nigeria and the UK, when clinically stable. Age-matched controls were also included in Nigeria to validate the Global Lung Initiative spirometry reference values. Results Nigerian SCA patients (n=154) had significant reductions in both FEV 1 and FVC of \u223c1 z-score compared with local controls (n=364) and \u223c0.5 z-scores compared with the UK patients (n=101). Wasting (body mass index z-score<-2) had a prevalence of 27% in Nigerian patients and 7% in the UK ones (p<0.001). Among children with SCA, being resident in Nigeria (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 4.9), wasting (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 5.0) and each additional year of age (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.4) were independently associated with increased risk of restrictive spirometry (FVC z-score<-1.64+FEV 1/FVC\u2265-1.64). Conclusions This study showed that chronic respiratory impairment is more severe in children with SCA from West Africa than Europe. Our findings suggest the utility of implementing respiratory assessment in African children with SCA to early identify those with chronic lung injury, eligible for closer follow-up and more aggressive therapies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["clinical epidemiology", "paediatric lung disaese", "respiratory measurement"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Anemia, Sickle Cell", "Anthropometry", "Child", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "England", "Female", "Forced Expiratory Volume", "Humans", "Male", "Nigeria", "Nutritional Status", "Prevalence", "Prospective Studies", "Respiratory Function Tests", "Respiratory Insufficiency", "Risk Factors", "Spirometry", "Vital Capacity", "Wasting Syndrome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073732488", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"35338800000": {"Name": "Arigliani M.", "AuthorID": "35338800000", "AffiliationID": "60015397", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Division of Pediatrics, University Hospital of Udine"}, "7004700939": {"Name": "Zuiani C.", "AuthorID": "7004700939", "AffiliationID": "60015397", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Division of Pediatrics, University Hospital of Udine"}, "57210079381": {"Name": "Canciani M.C.", "AuthorID": "57210079381", "AffiliationID": "60015397", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Division of Pediatrics, University Hospital of Udine"}, "6603967151": {"Name": "Cogo P.", "AuthorID": "6603967151", "AffiliationID": "60015397", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Division of Pediatrics, University Hospital of Udine"}, "55807977800": {"Name": "Castriotta L.", "AuthorID": "55807977800", "AffiliationID": "60015397", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Hygiene and Clinical Epidemiology, University Hospital of Udine"}, "57205191266": {"Name": "Zubair R.", "AuthorID": "57205191266", "AffiliationID": "60105033", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Barau Dikko Teaching Hospital, Kaduna State University"}, "57211392527": {"Name": "Sunday A.D.", "AuthorID": "57211392527", "AffiliationID": "60105033", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Barau Dikko Teaching Hospital, Kaduna State University"}, "57194089211": {"Name": "Dogara L.G.", "AuthorID": "57194089211", "AffiliationID": "60105033", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hematology, Barau Dikko Teaching Hospital, Kaduna State University"}, "56609320400": {"Name": "Raywood E.", "AuthorID": "56609320400", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory, Critical Care and Anaesthesia Section, III Programme, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "55620520200": {"Name": "Vecchiato K.", "AuthorID": "55620520200", "AffiliationID": "60018363", "AffiliationName": "University of Trieste"}, "57200646507": {"Name": "Petoello E.", "AuthorID": "57200646507", "AffiliationID": "60032256", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgical Sciences, Dentistry, Gynecology and Pediatrics, Pediatric Division, University of Verona"}, "57192941630": {"Name": "Ndoro S.", "AuthorID": "57192941630", "AffiliationID": "60107269, 60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Haematology, Evelina London Children's Hospital, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust"}, "8562039200": {"Name": "Inusa B.", "AuthorID": "8562039200", "AffiliationID": "60107269, 60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Haematology, Evelina London Children's Hospital, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust"}, "57214417067": {"Name": "Gupta A.", "AuthorID": "57214417067", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Respiratory Medicine, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
