We observed previously that partial oxidation was responsible for increased TKhigh activity, while low-activity TKlow was unmodified. In the present study, the fluorescence-based cofactor-binding assay was adapted to detect binding of the \u03b2-hydroxypyruvate (HPA) donor substrate to wild-type transketolase and a variant, S385Y/D469T/R520Q, that is active towards aromatic aldehydes. Transketolase HPA affinity again revealed the two distinct forms of transketolase at a TKhigh:TKlow ratio that matched those observed previously via TPP binding to each variant. The HPA dissociation constant of TKlow was comparable to the substrate-inhibition dissociation constant, Ki HPA, determined previously. We provide evidence that Ki HPA is a convolution of binding to the low-activity TKlow-TKlow dimer, and the TKlow subunit of the partially-active TKhigh-TKlow mixed dimer, where HPA binding to the TKlow subunit of the mixed dimer results in inhibition of the active TKhigh subunit. Heat-activation of transketolase was similarly investigated and found to convert the TKlow subunit of the mixed dimer to have TKhigh-like properties, but without oxidation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Escherichia coli", "Escherichia coli Proteins", "Models, Theoretical", "Oxidation-Reduction", "Protein Binding", "Transketolase"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081372943", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56448234000": {"Name": "Wilkinson H.C.", "AuthorID": "56448234000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "6701589883": {"Name": "Dalby P.A.", "AuthorID": "6701589883", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
