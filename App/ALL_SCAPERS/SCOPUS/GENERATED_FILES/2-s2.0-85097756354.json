Emerging in a context of increasing decentralisation, the two MPAs have strongly relied on economic incentives, notably funding from donors and NGOs, to encourage behaviour changes towards achieving conservation objectives. Since donor funding ended, economic incentives used in governing the two MPAs have shifted the focus to income generated from MPA user fees. Consequently, the increasing influence of market forces, through mass tourism and incoming fishing pressures, has led to vested interests between provincial/city governments with tourism operators/developers and between local and non-local fishers. This paper stresses that without interventions from the central government or even international actors, the current MPA governance framework and incentives are insufficient to address the growing conflicts between biodiversity conservation and economic development. To improve MPA governance, strengthening legal incentives and stimulating political will from the central government are of the utmost importance. Also, given that social inequity issues are undermining local acceptance and support for MPAs, it is essential to empower local communities in decision-making over their resources by using property rights and promoting small-scale community-based development, while ensuring that such rights and development adhere to MPA conservation objectives. Moreover, tourism operators/developers need to be involved in governing MPAs in such a way that could contribute towards sustainable resource use and social equity for local communities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biodiversity conservation", "Biosphere reserves", "Cu Lao Cham", "Decentralisation", "Eco-tourism", "Governance", "Marine Protected Areas", "Nha Trang Bay", "Sustainable development", "Vietnam"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85097756354", "SubjectAreas": [["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"57216658874": {"Name": "Khuu D.T.", "AuthorID": "57216658874", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Sustainable Resources (ISR), University College London"}, "7004909341": {"Name": "Ekins P.", "AuthorID": "7004909341", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Sustainable Resources (ISR), University College London"}, "55474784800": {"Name": "Jones P.J.", "AuthorID": "55474784800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}}}
