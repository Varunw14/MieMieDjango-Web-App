In this study, we have assessed the impact of idealism and relativism using the Ethics Position Theory. We have tested its capacity to predict moral identity, moral judgement of social vs. environmental issues, and self-reported pro-environmental behaviours. The results from an online MTurk study of 432 US participants revealed that idealism had a significant impact on all the tested variables, but the case was different with relativism. Consistently with the findings of previous studies, we found relativism to be a strong predictor of moral identity and moral judgement of social issues. In contrast, relativism only weakly interacted with making moral judgements of environmental issues, and had no effects in predicting pro-environmental behaviours. These findings suggest that Ethics Position Theory could have a strong potential for defining moral differences between environmental attitudes and behaviours, capturing the moral drivers of an attitude-behaviour gap, which continuously stands as a barrier in motivating people to become more pro-environmental.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Conservation of Natural Resources", "Environmental Health", "Female", "Humans", "Judgment", "Male", "Morals", "Social Behavior"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094832582", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57218137693": {"Name": "Zaikauskaite L.", "AuthorID": "57218137693", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "57219696388": {"Name": "Chen X.", "AuthorID": "57219696388", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "24598393300": {"Name": "Tsivrikos D.", "AuthorID": "24598393300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}}}
