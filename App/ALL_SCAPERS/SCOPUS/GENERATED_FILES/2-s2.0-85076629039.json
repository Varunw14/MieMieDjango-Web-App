In particular, studies in the primary visual cortex of mice show that both running speed and passive whole-body rotation modulates neuronal activity, and modern genetically targeted viral tracing approaches have begun to identify previously unknown circuits that underlie these responses. Here we review recent experimental findings and provide a road map for future work in mice to elucidate the functional architecture and emergent properties of a cortical network potentially involved in the generation of egocentric-based visual representations for navigation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cerebral Cortex", "Mice", "Motion", "Motion Perception", "Neurons", "Visual Cortex"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076629039", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"55321561100": {"Name": "Chaplin T.A.", "AuthorID": "55321561100", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Australian Research Council, Centre of Excellence for Integrative Brain Function, Monash University Node"}, "6602716645": {"Name": "Margrie T.W.", "AuthorID": "6602716645", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour, University College London"}}}
