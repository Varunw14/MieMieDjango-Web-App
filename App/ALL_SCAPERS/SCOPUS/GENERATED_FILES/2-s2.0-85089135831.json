However, in order for geopolymers to reach their full potential, it is crucial to understand the influence of various parameters (e.g., particle size, treatment of precursor, chemical composition) on the hardening evolution at earlier ages of the pastes and the resulting final mechanical strength of the set system. Hence, this paper reviews known factors that influence the setting time of fresh geopolymers and discusses the underlying chemical- and physical-mechanisms of each parameter. Next to this, the interconnection between the setting time and mechanical strength is discussed. This will provide a platform for researchers and engineers to understand the hardening evolution of geopolymers in a broader range.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acceleration", "Compressive strength", "Geopolymer", "Retardation", "Setting time"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cement production", "Chemical compositions", "Hardening evolution", "Physical mechanism", "Set system", "Setting time"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089135831", "SubjectAreas": [["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"55484588000": {"Name": "Ranjbar N.", "AuthorID": "55484588000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "48361713200": {"Name": "Spangenberg J.", "AuthorID": "48361713200", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Technical University of Denmark"}, "57190658824": {"Name": "Mehrali M.", "AuthorID": "57190658824", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Technical University of Denmark"}, "26436419100": {"Name": "Kuenzel C.", "AuthorID": "26436419100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Imperial College London"}}}
