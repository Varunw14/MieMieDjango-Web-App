However, the definition of AD has been confounded with dementia in many studies. Thus, overinterpretation of genetic findings with regard to mechanisms and drug targets may explain, in part, controversies in the field. Here, we analyze the different forms of genetic risk of AD and how these can be used to model disease. We stress the importance of studying gene variants in the right cell types and in the right pathological context. The lack of mechanistic understanding of genetic variation has become the major bottleneck in the search for new drug targets for AD.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Drug Development", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genetic Variation", "Humans", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Molecular Targeted Therapy", "Risk", "Translational Medical Research"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092442295", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"35109966200": {"Name": "Sierksma A.", "AuthorID": "35109966200", "AffiliationID": "60121269, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for the Research of Neurodegenerative Diseases, Department of Neurosciences, Leuven Brain Institute (LBI), KU Leuven (University of Leuven)"}, "7006241978": {"Name": "De Strooper B.", "AuthorID": "7006241978", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute, University College London"}, "57216308589": {"Name": "Escott-Price V.", "AuthorID": "57216308589", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute, Cardiff University"}}}
