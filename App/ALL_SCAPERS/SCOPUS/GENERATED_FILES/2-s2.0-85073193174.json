The robot is made of customized 3D-printed material (ABS plastic) and electronics, and commercial Robotics Dynamixel MX-28 actuators, as well as visual RGB-D and IMU sensing systems. We show that the robot is able to perform some locomotion/visual-odometry tasks and it is easy to switch between different feet designs, providing also a novel Center-of-Pressure (CoP) sensing system, so that it can deal with various types of terrain. Moreover, we provide a description of its control and perception system architecture, as well as our opensource software packages that provide sensing and navigation tools for locomotion and visual odometry on the robot. Finally, we briefly discuss the transferability of some prototype research that has been done on the developed mini-biped, to half or fullsize humanoid robots, such as COMAN or WALK-MAN.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Center of pressure", "Humanoid robot", "Low cost and reliable", "Navigation tools", "Perception systems", "Printed materials", "Sensing systems", "Visual odometry"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073193174", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"]], "AuthorData": {"6602732245": {"Name": "Vona M.", "AuthorID": "6602732245", "AffiliationID": "60028628", "AffiliationName": "CCIS, Northeastern University"}, "26023306800": {"Name": "Kanoulas D.", "AuthorID": "26023306800", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Department, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), Humanoid and Human-Centered Mechatronics"}}}
