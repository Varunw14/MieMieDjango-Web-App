Clinicians usually consult pediatric formularies or online databases for dose selection, but these have variable recommendations, are usually based on expert opinion and are not graded based on the existing pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) studies. We describe here a potential new tool that could be used to grade the strength of evidence emanating from PKPD studies. Areas covered: A scoring system was developed (GAPPS tool) to quantify the strength of each PK assessment and rate the studies quality in already published articles. GAPPS was evaluated by applying it to pediatric PKPD studies of antibiotics from the 2019 Essential Medicines List for children (EMLC), identified through a search of PubMed. Expert opinion: Evidence for most antibiotic dose selection decisions was generally weak, coming from individual PK studies and lacked PKPD modeling and simulations. However, the quality of evidence appears to have improved over the last two decades. Incorporating a formal grading system, such as GAPPS, into formulary development will provide a transparent tool to support decision-making in clinical practice and guideline development, and guide PKPD authors on study designs most likely to influence guidelines.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antibiotic dosing", "grading evidence", "pediatric dosing", "PKPD", "WHO EMLc"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Child", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Models, Biological", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Research Design"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075738639", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)", "PHAR", "3000"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57193720042": {"Name": "Gastine S.", "AuthorID": "57193720042", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "54895018200": {"Name": "Barker C.I.S.", "AuthorID": "54895018200", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Infectious Diseases Research Group, Institute for Infection and Immunity, St George\u2019s, University of London"}, "8702431000": {"Name": "Standing J.F.", "AuthorID": "8702431000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacy Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "54584268300": {"Name": "Rashed A.N.", "AuthorID": "54584268300", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, King\u2019s College London"}, "35068032100": {"Name": "Hsia Y.", "AuthorID": "35068032100", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, Queen\u2019s University Belfast"}, "55057756400": {"Name": "Jackson C.", "AuthorID": "55057756400", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Infectious Diseases Research Group, Institute for Infection and Immunity, St George\u2019s, University of London"}, "57192299193": {"Name": "Mathur S.", "AuthorID": "57192299193", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Infectious Diseases Research Group, Institute for Infection and Immunity, St George\u2019s, University of London"}, "55751670800": {"Name": "Bielicki J.", "AuthorID": "55751670800", "AffiliationID": "60023588", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Pharmacology Group, University of Basel Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "57203106412": {"Name": "Sharland M.", "AuthorID": "57203106412", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Infectious Diseases Research Group, Institute for Infection and Immunity, St George\u2019s, University of London"}, "55404681700": {"Name": "Tomlin S.", "AuthorID": "55404681700", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacy Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55891721400": {"Name": "Lutsar I.", "AuthorID": "55891721400", "AffiliationID": "60068856", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tartu"}}}
