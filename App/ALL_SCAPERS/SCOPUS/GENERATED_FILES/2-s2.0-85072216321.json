In this paper, current epidemiology of gonorrhoea is reviewed through an international lens and with a focus on selected populations. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that \u223c87 million new gonococcal infections occurred among people aged 15-49 years in 2016. Gonorrhoea rates are rising in many countries. Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men, racial or ethnic minorities, Indigenous populations and sex workers appear to bear disproportionate burdens of gonorrhoea. International travel can facilitate spread of gonorrhoea, including resistant strains, across international borders. Critical gaps in epidemiological knowledge are highlighted, including data on gonorrhoea among transgender persons and the burden of extragenital gonorrhoea. Even as further data are gathered, action - informed by currently available data - is needed now to confront this growing international threat.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Neisseria gonorrhoeae"], "IndexKeywords": ["Female", "Global Health", "Gonorrhea", "Homosexuality, Male", "Humans", "Male", "Minority Groups", "Neisseria gonorrhoeae", "Risk Factors", "Sex Workers", "Transgender Persons"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072216321", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"15757325200": {"Name": "Kirkcaldy R.D.", "AuthorID": "15757325200", "AffiliationID": "60000177, 60021658", "AffiliationName": "Division of STD Prevention, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}, "57080564300": {"Name": "Weston E.", "AuthorID": "57080564300", "AffiliationID": "60000177, 60021658", "AffiliationName": "Division of STD Prevention, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}, "35546428000": {"Name": "Segurado A.C.", "AuthorID": "35546428000", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "7402326764": {"Name": "Hughes G.", "AuthorID": "7402326764", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "HIV and STI Department, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}}}
