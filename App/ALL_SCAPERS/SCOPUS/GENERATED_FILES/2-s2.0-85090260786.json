Subclonal reconstruction methods based on machine learning aim to separate those subpopulations in a sample and infer their evolutionary history. However, current approaches are entirely data driven and agnostic to evolutionary theory. We demonstrate that systematic errors occur in the analysis if evolution is not accounted for, and this is exacerbated with multi-sampling of the same tumor. We present a novel approach for model-based tumor subclonal reconstruction, called MOBSTER, which combines machine learning with theoretical population genetics. Using public whole-genome sequencing data from 2,606 samples from different cohorts, new data and synthetic validation, we show that this method is more robust and accurate than current techniques in single-sample, multiregion and longitudinal data. This approach minimizes the confounding factors of nonevolutionary methods, thus leading to more accurate recovery of the evolutionary history of human cancers.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Clonal Evolution", "Genetics, Population", "Genomics", "Humans", "Machine Learning", "Neoplasms", "Whole Genome Sequencing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090260786", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"56497236700": {"Name": "Caravagna G.", "AuthorID": "56497236700", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Evolutionary Genomics and Modelling Lab, Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "56580125700": {"Name": "Heide T.", "AuthorID": "56580125700", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Evolutionary Genomics and Modelling Lab, Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "55704742600": {"Name": "Zapata L.", "AuthorID": "55704742600", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Evolutionary Genomics and Modelling Lab, Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "56895867100": {"Name": "Nichol D.", "AuthorID": "56895867100", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Evolutionary Genomics and Modelling Lab, Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "57204012661": {"Name": "Chkhaidze K.", "AuthorID": "57204012661", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Evolutionary Genomics and Modelling Lab, Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "57188626663": {"Name": "Cresswell G.D.", "AuthorID": "57188626663", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Evolutionary Genomics and Modelling Lab, Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "54788610100": {"Name": "Werner B.", "AuthorID": "54788610100", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Evolutionary Genomics and Modelling Lab, Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "57212498766": {"Name": "Acar A.", "AuthorID": "57212498766", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Evolutionary Genomics and Modelling Lab, Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "25947907300": {"Name": "Sottoriva A.", "AuthorID": "25947907300", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Evolutionary Genomics and Modelling Lab, Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "57061265800": {"Name": "Williams M.J.", "AuthorID": "57061265800", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Evolution and Cancer Lab, Barts Cancer Institute, School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57188748588": {"Name": "Cross W.", "AuthorID": "57188748588", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Evolution and Cancer Lab, Barts Cancer Institute, School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "26021895300": {"Name": "Graham T.A.", "AuthorID": "26021895300", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Evolution and Cancer Lab, Barts Cancer Institute, School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "6603378797": {"Name": "Chesler L.", "AuthorID": "6603378797", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Studies, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "57202058182": {"Name": "Barnes C.P.", "AuthorID": "57202058182", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology and UCL Genetics Institute, University College London"}, "7004022389": {"Name": "Sanguinetti G.", "AuthorID": "7004022389", "AffiliationID": "60012227", "AffiliationName": "International School for Advanced Studies"}}}
