Prognostic research in this area increasingly draws on datasets associating structural brain imaging data with outcome scores for ever-larger samples of stroke patients. The aim is to learn brain-behaviour trends from these data, and generalize those trends to predict outcomes for new patients. The practical significance of this work depends on the expected breadth of that generalization. Here, we show that these models can generalize across countries and native languages (from British patients tested in English to Chilean patients tested in Spanish), across neuroimaging technology (from MRI to CT), and from scans collected months or years after stroke for research purposes, to scans collected days or weeks after stroke for clinical purposes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aphasia", "Lesion growth", "Plasticity", "Prognosis", "Stroke"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aphasia", "Chile", "Datasets as Topic", "Female", "Humans", "Language Tests", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Models, Neurological", "Neuroimaging", "Neuronal Plasticity", "Prognosis", "Reproducibility of Results", "Stroke", "Time Factors", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073754185", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"36621038900": {"Name": "Loughnan R.", "AuthorID": "36621038900", "AffiliationID": "60121539, 60030612", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cognitive Science, University of California"}, "57194776949": {"Name": "Lorca-Puls D.L.", "AuthorID": "57194776949", "AffiliationID": "60001282", "AffiliationName": "Department of Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad de Concepcion"}, "57194767907": {"Name": "Gajardo-Vidal A.", "AuthorID": "57194767907", "AffiliationID": "60006469", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health Sciences, Universidad del Desarrollo"}, "35448982000": {"Name": "Price C.J.", "AuthorID": "35448982000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "55650055400": {"Name": "Hope T.M.H.", "AuthorID": "55650055400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "57211394098": {"Name": "Espejo-Videla V.", "AuthorID": "57211394098", "AffiliationID": "60001282", "AffiliationName": "Department of Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad de Concepcion"}, "23990683200": {"Name": "Gillebert C.R.", "AuthorID": "23990683200", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain and Cognition, University of Leuven"}, "9742268600": {"Name": "Mantini D.", "AuthorID": "9742268600", "AffiliationID": "60103766", "AffiliationName": "Functional Neuroimaging Laboratory, IRCCS San Camillo Hospital Foundation"}}}
