Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Bilateria are the predominant clade of animals on Earth. Despite having evolved a wide variety of body plans and developmental modes, they are characterized by common morphological traits. By default, researchers have tried to link clade-specific genes to these traits, thus distinguishing bilaterians from non-bilaterians, by their gene content. Here we argue that it is rather biological processes that unite Bilateria and set them apart from their non-bilaterian sisters, with a less complex body morphology. To test this hypothesis, we compared proteomes of bilaterian and non-bilaterian species in an elaborate computational pipeline, aiming to search for a set of bilaterian-specific genes. Despite the limited confidence in their bilaterian specificity, we nevertheless detected Bilateria-specific functional and developmental patterns in the sub-set of genes conserved in distantly related Bilateria. Using a novel multi-species GO-enrichment method, we determined the functional repertoire of genes that are widely conserved among Bilateria. Analyzing expression profiles in three very distantly related model species\u2014D.melanogaster, D.rerio and C.elegans\u2014we find characteristic peaks at comparable stages of development and a delayed onset of expression in embryos. In particular, the expression of the conserved genes appears to peak at the phylotypic stage of different bilaterian phyla. In summary, our study illustrate how development connects distantly related Bilateria after millions of years of divergence, pointing to processes potentially separating them from non-bilaterians. We argue that evolutionary biologists should return from a purely gene-centric view of evolution and place more focus on analyzing and defining conserved developmental processes and periods.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bilateria", "Development", "Evodevo", "Evolution", "Expression profile", "Gene ontology", "Orthology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090206906", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"], ["Paleontology", "EART", "1911"]], "AuthorData": {"57202447304": {"Name": "Ferretti L.", "AuthorID": "57202447304", "AffiliationID": "60027004", "AffiliationName": "The Pirbright Institute"}, "57218768951": {"Name": "Kr\u00e4mer-Eis A.", "AuthorID": "57218768951", "AffiliationID": "60024025", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Genetik, Universit\u00e4t zu K\u00f6ln"}, "55249661600": {"Name": "Schiffer P.H.", "AuthorID": "55249661600", "AffiliationID": "60024025", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Zoologie, Universit\u00e4t zu K\u00f6ln"}}}
