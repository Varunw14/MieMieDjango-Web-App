It makes a theoretical contribution by identifying how project organizations re-create patterns of action\u2014organizational routines\u2014as they transition through life cycle stages. It presents the findings of an autoethnographic empirical study and, through the lens of routine dynamics, contributes to the project management literature by identifying a five-stage process model of transitioning and the generative mechanisms involved in re-creating patterns of action.", "AuthorKeywords": ["organizational routines", "project life cycle", "project organizing", "transition"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091075543", "SubjectAreas": [["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"57203369791": {"Name": "Addyman S.", "AuthorID": "57203369791", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Construction and Project Management at University College London"}, "6603787961": {"Name": "Pryke S.", "AuthorID": "6603787961", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Construction and Project Management at University College London"}, "57210968448": {"Name": "Davies A.", "AuthorID": "57210968448", "AffiliationID": "60171149", "AffiliationName": "Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU), University of Sussex Business School"}}}
