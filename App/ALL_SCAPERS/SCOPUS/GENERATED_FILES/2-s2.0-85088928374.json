However, PLWD's ability to engage with CBT has been questioned due to the presumed impact of neurocognitive impairment on core skills necessary to engage with CBT (pre-therapy skills). Here, we (i) compare CBT pre-therapy skills in PLWD to older and younger adults (OA, YA), (ii) examine potential confounders and mediators and (iii) explore associations of neurocognition, anxiety and depression with pre-therapy skills in PLWD. Methods: Pre-therapy skills were compared between PLWD (n = 102), OA (n = 77) and YA (n = 56). Structural equation modelling was used to assess mediators and confounders of differences in pre-therapy skills between groups. Spearman's rank correlations were used to examine the relationship of pre-therapy skills with neurocognition and mood in PLWD. Results: Group differences in pre-therapy skills were found, following the pattern YA>OA>PLWD. Neurocognition mediated the difference between OA and PLWD. In PLWD, language was associated with performance on all skills. There was little evidence that anxiety or depression contributed to variability in skill performance within PLWD. Limitations: Cross-sectional design limited ability to ascertain cause and effect. Pre-therapy skill measures have not been used in the context of actual CBT; consequently, their relationship with CBT outcomes needs to be established. Conclusions: PLWD may have a relative difficulty in CBT pre-therapy skills. Yet, there seems to be substantial variability of skill level, independent of mood. Therefore, mild dementia does not necessarily preclude CBT readiness.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anxiety", "Cognitive behavioural therapy", "Dementia", "Depression", "Mood", "Neurocognition"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088928374", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"36441678800": {"Name": "Stott J.", "AuthorID": "36441678800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "6507888355": {"Name": "Scior K.", "AuthorID": "6507888355", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "57193339910": {"Name": "Brede J.", "AuthorID": "57193339910", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "6602617245": {"Name": "Charlesworth G.", "AuthorID": "6602617245", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "57208491461": {"Name": "Cadman T.", "AuthorID": "57208491461", "AffiliationID": "60171764", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Science, Bristol Medical School, Oakfield House, Oakfield Grove"}}}
