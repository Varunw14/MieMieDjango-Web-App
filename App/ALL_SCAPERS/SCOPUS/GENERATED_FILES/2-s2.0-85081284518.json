They vary in color, flavor, smell, thereby increasing interest in honey characterization relating to botanical origin. A total of 155 honey samples belonging to Brazilian flora were examined on the pollen analysis; sampling is made in a span of one year. The preparation followed melisso palynological analysis based on the specific botanical variety. The pollen spectra revealed 60 pollen types belonging to 27 plant families and Myrtaceae, Fabaceae and Asteraceae were the dominant plant families. Few pollen types were found in most samples of honey. The families that showed major richness of pollen types were Fabaceae and Asteraceae. Only six floral sources of pollen plants and three floral sources of nectar plants appeared in the category of predominant pollen. The unifloral honeys were slightly more frequent than polyfloral, and wild floral species dominated most of the honey samples. These floral sources, even in minor parts in the honeys samples, are also part of the biological feature of theses honeys. The honeys from natural fields cannot be completely accounted by the term unifloral honeys.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Conservation", "Ecology", "Plant diversity", "Pollen analysis", "Trophic niche"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081284518", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57215594021": {"Name": "Haidamus S.L.", "AuthorID": "57215594021", "AffiliationID": "60027947", "AffiliationName": "Animal Science Institute, Federal Rural University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRRJ)"}, "6506439848": {"Name": "Affonso Lorenzon M.C.", "AuthorID": "6506439848", "AffiliationID": "60027947", "AffiliationName": "Animal Science Institute, Federal Rural University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRRJ)"}, "55822854400": {"Name": "Koshiyama A.S.", "AuthorID": "55822854400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science Postgraduate Program, University College London (UCL)"}, "24072266100": {"Name": "de Sousa Tassinari W.", "AuthorID": "24072266100", "AffiliationID": "60026004", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ)"}}}
