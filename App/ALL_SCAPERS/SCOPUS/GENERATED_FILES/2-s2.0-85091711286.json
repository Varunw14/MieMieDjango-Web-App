We describe a novel L683\u2217 mutation, predicted to cause a truncated protein and therefore be pathogenic, in a patient presenting with nonfluent variant primary progressive aphasia at the age of 65 years. Her disease progressed over the following years, leading to her being mute and wheelchair bound seven years into her illness. Brain imaging showed asymmetrical left-sided predominant atrophy affecting the frontal, insular, and temporal cortices as well as the striatum in particular. Review of the literature found 60 different nonsense, frameshift, deletion, or splice site mutations, including the newly described mutation, with data on clinical diagnosis available in 110 people: 58% of the cases presented with an ALS syndrome, 16% with an FTD-ALS overlap, 19% with a cognitive presentation (including behavioral variant FTD and primary progressive aphasia) and 4% with atypical parkinsonism. Age at onset (AAO) data were available in 75 people: mean (standard deviation) AAO was 57.5 (10.3) in those with ALS, which was significantly younger than those with a cognitive presentation (AAO = 65.1 (10.5), p = 0.008), or atypical parkinsonism (AAO = 68.3 (8.7), p = 0.021), with a trend compared with the FTD-ALS group (AAO = 61.9 (7.0), p=0.065); there was no significant difference in AAO between the other groups. In conclusion, clinical syndromes across the whole FTD-ALS-atypical parkinsonism spectrum have been reported in conjunction with mutations in TBK1. It is therefore important to include TBK1 on future gene panels for each of these disorders and to suspect such mutations particularly when there are multiple different phenotypes in the same family.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Frontotemporal dementia", "Primary progressive aphasia", "TBK1"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091711286", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"57218098289": {"Name": "Swift I.J.", "AuthorID": "57218098289", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at University College London, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57219210361": {"Name": "Benotmane H.", "AuthorID": "57219210361", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at University College London, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "54390725600": {"Name": "Bocchetta M.", "AuthorID": "54390725600", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Dementia Research Centre, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "35243804200": {"Name": "Woollacott I.O.", "AuthorID": "35243804200", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Dementia Research Centre, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57207107542": {"Name": "Shafei R.", "AuthorID": "57207107542", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Dementia Research Centre, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "14020386900": {"Name": "Rohrer J.D.", "AuthorID": "14020386900", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Dementia Research Centre, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
