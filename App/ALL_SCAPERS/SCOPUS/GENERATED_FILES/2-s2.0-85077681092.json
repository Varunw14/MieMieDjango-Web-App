The contact zone provides a framework for the consideration of potential confrontations and uncertainties during intercultural contacts between migrant children, their family, and another adult. The other adult is usually someone in a position of authority. For young people who language broker, managing the uncertainties and confrontations of conflictual situations highlighted three positionalities: (a) \u201cconflict avoider,\u201d (b) \u201cthe neutral or passive broker,\u201d and (c) the \u201cactive broker.\u201d The contact zone was a sphere of experience that opened up possibilities for agentic action as well as constraints. The contact zone had the potential to foreground different aspects of their status such as \u201cthe child,\u201d \u201cthe immigrant,\u201d or the second-language speaker. Equally, the young people took opportunities to utilize these statuses as part of their dialogical positionalities to get the best outcome for them and/or their families. We argue that further exploration of the contact zone within the framing of dialogical positionalities can enable better understanding of critical cultural-development childhoods.", "AuthorKeywords": ["child language brokering", "children\u2019s migration", "contact zone", "dialogical self", "nonnormative childhood"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077681092", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"26531005300": {"Name": "Crafter S.", "AuthorID": "26531005300", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "The Open University"}, "57062268300": {"Name": "Iqbal H.", "AuthorID": "57062268300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
