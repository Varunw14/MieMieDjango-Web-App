Two non-intrusive ultrasonic methods were proposed for measuring the film thickness distribution of the bearing, i.e., the full circumferential measurement and the prediction based on limited measuring points. The ultrasonic recognition model of film thickness was built. A film thickness measuring device and its calibration device were constructed. A calibration experiment in the range of 1-150 \u03bcm and a measurement experiment of the bearing's film thickness distribution were carried out. The results showed that in the calibration range, the relative error of most recognition values was less than \u00b15%, and some are less than 3%. The identification accuracy of the spring model has a zoned phenomenon. The relative difference between the experimental and the simulated values of the film thickness was less than 8% under most working conditions. The predicted values of eccentricity, attitude angle, and minimum film thickness have a small difference from the simulated values, indicating that the accuracy of the measurement method is high.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Calibration experiments", "Film thickness distribution", "Identification accuracy", "Lubrication state", "Measurement experiments", "Measurement methods", "Ultrasonic methods", "Ultrasonic recognition"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087474182", "SubjectAreas": [["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"55331726400": {"Name": "Ouyang W.", "AuthorID": "55331726400", "AffiliationID": "60022414", "AffiliationName": "School of Energy and Power Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology"}, "57217671527": {"Name": "Zhou Z.", "AuthorID": "57217671527", "AffiliationID": "60022414", "AffiliationName": "School of Energy and Power Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology"}, "36018351800": {"Name": "Jin Y.", "AuthorID": "36018351800", "AffiliationID": "60022414", "AffiliationName": "School of Energy and Power Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology"}, "57200980418": {"Name": "Yan X.", "AuthorID": "57200980418", "AffiliationID": "115178096", "AffiliationName": "Reliability Engineering Institute, National Engineering Research Center for Water Transport Safety"}, "56515441900": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "56515441900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
