However, it is unknown whether it is frequency of arts engagement or individual ability in arts activities that is associated with these benefits. This study therefore examines the link between arts ability and children\u2019s behavioural difficulties and self-esteem independent of frequency of engagement. We analysed data from the 1970 British Cohort Study with an overall sample size of 7700 for the behavioural difficulties outcome, and of 4991 for the self-esteem outcome. Baseline measures were taken when the children were aged 10 and followed up at age 16. OLS regression analysis adjusted for identified confounders shows that ability in the arts at age 10 was associated with a lower level of behavioural difficulties at age 16 independent of baseline behaviours, identified confounders and frequency of arts engagement. An association between arts ability and self-esteem was only found amongst children who have higher educational ability. These result suggest that there may be a value to encouraging the cultivation of arts skills at the onset of adolescence as a way of helping to foster children\u2019s positive behavioural development.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adolescent Behavior", "Art", "Child", "Child Behavior", "Child Behavior Disorders", "Creativity", "Educational Status", "Female", "Humans", "Leisure Activities", "Male", "Mothers", "Music", "Parent-Child Relations", "Prospective Studies", "Psychology, Adolescent", "Psychology, Child", "Self Concept", "Socioeconomic Factors", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072924960", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57201744182": {"Name": "Mak H.W.", "AuthorID": "57201744182", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "55911947100": {"Name": "Fancourt D.", "AuthorID": "55911947100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}}}
