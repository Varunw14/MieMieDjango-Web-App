In this study, a modified pseudo-potential lattice Boltzmann (LB) multiphase model with tunable surface tension is proposed, which is further coupled with the geometrical formulation contact angle scheme to investigate the motion of droplets invoking the contact angle hysteresis. We focus on the dynamic behaviour of droplets driven by a body force at the Bond number ranging from 1 to 6, which is defined as the ratio of the body force to the capillary force. The droplet morphology change is examined by varying (i) the Bond number and (ii) the hysteresis window. Results show the droplet morphology evolution can be classified into different stages, including stretch, relaxation, and equilibrium. The droplet oscillation phenomenon at large Bond numbers at the equilibrium stage is observed for the first time. In addition, it is found that such oscillation can lead to the breakup and/or coalescence of droplets when the surface waves spread on the top of the droplet. Furthermore, there is slight oscillation of the normalized length, width and height at the equilibrium stage for the neutral hysteresis window while more dramatic oscillation will appear for the hydrophobic hysteresis window.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bond number", "Contact angle hysteresis", "Lattice Boltzmann method", "Multiphase flow"], "IndexKeywords": ["Advancing and receding contact angles", "Bond numbers", "Contact angle hysteresis", "Droplet morphologies", "Droplet oscillations", "Dynamic behaviours", "Lattice boltzmann", "Lattice Boltzmann method"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078682421", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Colloid and Surface Chemistry", "CENG", "1505"]], "AuthorData": {"57208721016": {"Name": "Yang J.", "AuthorID": "57208721016", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Automotive Safety and Energy, School of Vehicle and Mobility, Tsinghua University"}, "56959642100": {"Name": "Ma X.", "AuthorID": "56959642100", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Automotive Safety and Energy, School of Vehicle and Mobility, Tsinghua University"}, "57207799213": {"Name": "Zhang X.", "AuthorID": "57207799213", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Automotive Safety and Energy, School of Vehicle and Mobility, Tsinghua University"}, "6603356005": {"Name": "Shuai S.", "AuthorID": "6603356005", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Automotive Safety and Energy, School of Vehicle and Mobility, Tsinghua University"}, "57196413477": {"Name": "Fei L.", "AuthorID": "57196413477", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60123068", "AffiliationName": "Center for Combustion Energy, Key Laboratory for Thermal Science and Power Engineering of Ministry of Education, Department of Energy and Power Engineering, Tsinghua University"}, "7102436109": {"Name": "Luo K.H.", "AuthorID": "7102436109", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
