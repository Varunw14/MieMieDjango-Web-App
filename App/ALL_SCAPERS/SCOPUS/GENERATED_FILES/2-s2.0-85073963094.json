Child Development Perspectives published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of Society for Research in Child DevelopmentDigital books, such as e-books, story apps, picture book apps, and interactive stories, are narratives presented on touchscreens with multimedia and interactive features. Evidence suggests that early reading of print versus digital books is associated with different patterns of parent\u2013child engagement and children\u2019s outcomes. Parents\u2019 verbal scaffolding, children\u2019s age, and the congruence between a book\u2019s narrative and its interactive and multimedia features are three documented process variables that explain the difference between reading print and digital books. To maximize the added value of digital books for children, we need to study the interaction among the characteristics of parents, children, and books; we also need to target these interactions through interventions and through collaborations between designers and researchers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["digital books", "e-books", "story apps"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073963094", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Life-span and Life-course Studies", "SOCI", "3319"]], "AuthorData": {"54408784700": {"Name": "Kucirkova N.", "AuthorID": "54408784700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
