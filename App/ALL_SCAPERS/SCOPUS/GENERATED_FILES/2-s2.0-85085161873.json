Recent studies suggest that the Earth could have gained a considerable amount of water during the early stages of its evolution from the hydrogen-rich solar nebula, and that a large amount of the water in the Earth may have partitioned into the core. Here we calculate the partitioning of water between iron and silicate melts at 20\u2013135 GPa and 2,800\u20135,000 K, using ab initio molecular dynamics and thermodynamic integration techniques. Our results indicate a siderophile nature of water at core\u2013mantle differentiation and core\u2013mantle boundary conditions, which weakens with increasing temperature; nevertheless, we found that water always partitions strongly into the iron liquid under core-formation conditions for both reducing and oxidizing scenarios. The siderophile nature of water was also verified by an empirical-counting method that calculates the distribution of hydrogen in an equilibrated iron and silicate melt. We therefore conclude that the Earth\u2019s core may act as a large reservoir that contains most of the Earth\u2019s water. In addition to constraining the accretion models of volatile delivery, the findings may partially account for the low density of the Earth\u2019s core implied by measured seismic velocities.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085161873", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"55588581000": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "55588581000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "6603903752": {"Name": "Vo\u010dadlo L.", "AuthorID": "6603903752", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "7004463552": {"Name": "Brodholt J.P.", "AuthorID": "7004463552", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Earth Evolution and Dynamics, University of Oslo"}, "57198550527": {"Name": "Sun T.", "AuthorID": "57198550527", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Computational Geodynamics, College of Earth and Planetary Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}}}
