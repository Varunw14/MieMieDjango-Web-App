We used cluster analysis to identify subgroups of cognitively unimpaired individuals (n = 99, 64\u201393 years) with different profiles of the cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers beta amyloid 1\u201342 (A\u03b242), phosphorylated tau (P-tau), total tau, chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40), fatty acid binding protein 3 (FABP3), and neurofilament light (NFL). Hippocampal volume and memory were assessed across multiple follow-up examinations covering up to 6.8 years. Clustering revealed one group (39%) with more pathological concentrations of all biomarkers, which could further be divided into one group (20%) characterized by tauopathy and high FABP3 and one (19%) by brain \u03b2-amyloidosis, high NFL, and slightly higher YKL-40. The clustering approach clearly outperformed classification based on A\u03b242 and P-tau alone in prediction of memory decline, with the individuals with most tauopathy and FABP3 showing more memory decline, but not more hippocampal volume change. The results demonstrate that older adults can be classified based on biomarkers beyond amyloid and tau, with improved prediction of memory decline.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Beta amyloid 1\u201342", "Biomarkers", "Cerebrospinal fluid", "Chitinase-3-like protein 1", "Fatty acid binding protein 3", "Hippocampal atrophy", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Memory", "Neurofilament light", "Phosphorylated tau", "Total tau"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Atrophy", "Biomarkers", "Chitinase-3-Like Protein 1", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Fatty Acid Binding Protein 3", "Female", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Male", "Memory", "Middle Aged", "Neurofilament Proteins", "Peptide Fragments", "Predictive Value of Tests", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084636277", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"56798381200": {"Name": "Idland A.V.", "AuthorID": "56798381200", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo"}, "35198893100": {"Name": "Sala-Llonch R.", "AuthorID": "35198893100", "AffiliationID": "60001576", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedicine, University of Barcelona"}, "57211492323": {"Name": "S\u00f8rensen \u00d8.", "AuthorID": "57211492323", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Center for Lifespan Changes in Brain and Cognition, Department of Psychology, University of Oslo"}, "6603364599": {"Name": "Walhovd K.B.", "AuthorID": "6603364599", "AffiliationID": "60105037", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Oslo University Hospital"}, "6601949049": {"Name": "Fjell A.M.", "AuthorID": "6601949049", "AffiliationID": "60105037", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Oslo University Hospital"}, "55946965200": {"Name": "Watne L.O.", "AuthorID": "55946965200", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo"}, "7006685915": {"Name": "Wyller T.B.", "AuthorID": "7006685915", "AffiliationID": "60105037", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geriatric Medicine, Oslo University Hospital"}, "6603569408": {"Name": "Br\u00e6khus A.", "AuthorID": "6603569408", "AffiliationID": "60105037", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Oslo University Hospital"}, "7006190615": {"Name": "Hansson O.", "AuthorID": "7006190615", "AffiliationID": "60014077", "AffiliationName": "Memory Clinic, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital"}, "7101909602": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "7101909602", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "57208899083": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "57208899083", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL"}}}
