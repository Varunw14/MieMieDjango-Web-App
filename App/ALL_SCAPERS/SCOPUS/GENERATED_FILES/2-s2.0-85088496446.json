Eng.", "Volume": "67", "Issue": 8, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 2215, "PageEnd": 2229, "CitedBy": 2, "DOI": "10.1109/TBME.2019.2957609", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85088496446&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 1964-2012 IEEE.Objective: In this work we address limitations in state-of-the-art ultrasound robots by designing and integrating a novel soft robotic system for ultrasound imaging. It employs the inherent qualities of soft fluidic actuators to establish safe, adaptable interaction between ultrasound probe and patient. Methods: We acquire clinical data to determine the movement ranges and force levels required in prenatal foetal ultrasound imaging and design the soft robotic end-effector accordingly. We verify its mechanical characteristics, derive and validate a kinetostatic model and demonstrate controllability and imaging capabilities on an ultrasound phantom. Results: The soft robot exhibits the desired stiffness characteristics and is able to reach 100% of the required workspace when no external force is present, and 95% of the workspace when considering its compliance. The model can accurately predict the end-effector pose with a mean error of 1.18 \u00b1 0.29 mm in position and 0.92 \u00b1 0.47\u00b0 in orientation. The derived controller is, with an average position error of 0.39 mm, able to track a target pose efficiently without and with externally applied loads. Ultrasound images acquired with the system are of equally good quality compared to a manual sonographer scan. Conclusion: The system is able to withstand loads commonly applied during foetal ultrasound scans and remains controllable with a motion range similar to manual scanning. Significance: The proposed soft robot presents a safe, cost-effective solution to offloading sonographers in day-to-day scanning routines. The design and modelling paradigms are greatly generalizable and particularly suitable for designing soft robots for physical interaction tasks.", "AuthorKeywords": ["design", "fabrication", "hydraulics", "imaging", "kinetostatics", "parallel", "Soft robotics", "ultrasound"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cost-effective solutions", "Design and integrations", "Imaging capabilities", "Mechanical characteristics", "Physical interactions", "Robotic end-effectors", "Stiffness characteristics", "Ultrasound imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088496446", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"56741222700": {"Name": "Lindenroth L.", "AuthorID": "56741222700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering, King's College London"}, "15042114800": {"Name": "Housden R.J.", "AuthorID": "15042114800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "57190987771": {"Name": "Wang S.", "AuthorID": "57190987771", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "56496402200": {"Name": "Back J.", "AuthorID": "56496402200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "9245867600": {"Name": "Rhode K.", "AuthorID": "9245867600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "55719408400": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "55719408400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}}}
