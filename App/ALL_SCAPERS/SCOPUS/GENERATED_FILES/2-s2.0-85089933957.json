Case presentation: We present two patients who presented with progressive chronic kidney disease of unknown cause. Both patients underwent successful renal transplantation but subsequently developed multisystem abnormalities, and were ultimately diagnosed with mitochondrial cytopathy 10-15 years following transplantation. Conclusions: Mitochondrial cytopathies are rare inborn errors of metabolism that should be considered in adults with renal impairment, especially in those with a family history of kidney or other multisystem disease. The widespread availability of genetic testing provides the potential for earlier diagnoses, thereby enhancing management decisions, anticipation of complications, avoidance of mitotoxic drugs, and informed prognosis prediction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Delayed diagnoses", "End stage renal disease", "Inherited conditions", "Mitochondrial cytopathies", "Multisystem disorders", "Primary mitochondrial disease", "Renal transplant"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089933957", "SubjectAreas": [["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"57216365063": {"Name": "Roper T.", "AuthorID": "57216365063", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Renal Medicine, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603918658": {"Name": "Harber M.", "AuthorID": "6603918658", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Renal Medicine, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57218505949": {"Name": "Jones G.", "AuthorID": "57218505949", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Renal Medicine, Royal Free Hospital"}, "55366513900": {"Name": "Salama A.D.", "AuthorID": "55366513900", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Renal Medicine, Royal Free Hospital"}, "24475469100": {"Name": "Pitceathly R.D.S.", "AuthorID": "24475469100", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
