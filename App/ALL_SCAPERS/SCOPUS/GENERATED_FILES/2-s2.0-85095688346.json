Objective: The aim of this study is to develop a \u201cbest practice model\u201d for dementia services managing crisis, as well as a set of resources to help teams implement this model to measure and improve practice delivery. These will be the best practice tool and toolkit to be utilized by teams to improve the effectiveness of crisis teams working with older people with dementia and their caregivers. This paper describes the protocol for a prospective study using qualitative methods to establish an understanding of the current practice to develop a \u201cbest practice model.\u201d Methods: Participants (people with dementia, caregivers, staff members, and stakeholders) from a variety of geographical areas, with a broad experience of crisis and noncrisis work, will be purposively selected to participate in qualitative approaches including interviews, focus groups, a consensus workshop, and development and field testing of both the best practice tool and toolkit. Results: Data were collected between October 2016 and August 2018. Thematic analysis will be utilized to establish the current working of teams managing crisis in dementia in order to draw together elements of the best practice. Conclusions: This is the first study to systematically explore the requirements needed to fulfill effective and appropriate home management for people with dementia and their caregivers at the time of mental health crisis, as delivered by teams managing crisis in dementia. This systematic approach to development will support greater acceptability and validity of the best practice tool and toolkit and lay the foundation for a large scale trial with teams managing crisis in dementia across England to investigate the effects on practice and impact on service provision, as well as the associated experiences of people with dementia and their caregivers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Caregivers", "Crisis", "Dementia", "Home management", "Mental health"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095688346", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57189006444": {"Name": "Stanyon M.", "AuthorID": "57189006444", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham"}, "54405136100": {"Name": "Streater A.", "AuthorID": "54405136100", "AffiliationID": "60107401", "AffiliationName": "Research and Development, North East London Foundation Trust"}, "6503984747": {"Name": "Coleston-Shields D.M.", "AuthorID": "6503984747", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham"}, "55926466100": {"Name": "Yates J.", "AuthorID": "55926466100", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham"}, "7006409234": {"Name": "Challis D.", "AuthorID": "7006409234", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham"}, "7004547326": {"Name": "Dening T.", "AuthorID": "7004547326", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham"}, "7006161600": {"Name": "Orrell M.", "AuthorID": "7006161600", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham"}, "57221872309": {"Name": "Prothero D.", "AuthorID": "57221872309", "AffiliationID": "60107401", "AffiliationName": "Research and Development, North East London Foundation Trust"}, "6603687595": {"Name": "Hoe J.", "AuthorID": "6603687595", "AffiliationID": "60033387", "AffiliationName": "Division of Nursing, School of Health Sciences, University of London"}, "35311223300": {"Name": "Lloyd-Evans B.", "AuthorID": "35311223300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "57221869896": {"Name": "Mitchell S.", "AuthorID": "57221869896", "AffiliationID": "60031464", "AffiliationName": "Research and Innovation, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603716658": {"Name": "Moniz-Cook E.", "AuthorID": "6603716658", "AffiliationID": "60030469", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Hull"}, "6507156058": {"Name": "Poland F.", "AuthorID": "6507156058", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Sciences, University of East Anglia"}}}
