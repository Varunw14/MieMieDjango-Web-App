It was identified at the time that periodic updates of indications would be required to stay abreast with state of the art and emerging indications and therapy. In recent years the field has not only seen an improvement in transplantation technology, thus widening the therapeutic scope of HCT, but additionally a whole new treatment strategy using modified immune effector cells, including chimeric antigen receptor T cells and engineered T-cell receptors, has emerged. The guidelines review committee of the ASTCT deemed it optimal to update the ASTCT recommendations for indications for HCT to include new data and to incorporate indications for immune effector cell therapy (IECT) where appropriate. The guidelines committee established a multiple stakeholder task force consisting of transplant experts, payer representatives, and a patient advocate to provide guidance on indications for HCT and IECT. This article presents the updated recommendations from the ASTCT on indications for HCT and IECT. Indications for HCT/IECT were categorized as (1) Standard of care, where indication is well defined and supported by evidence; (2) Standard of care, clinical evidence available, where large clinical trials and observational studies are not available but have been shown to be effective therapy; (3) Standard of care, rare indication, for rare diseases where demonstrated effectiveness exists but large clinical trials and observational studies are not feasible; (4) Developmental, for diseases where preclinical and/or early-phase clinical studies show HCT/IECT to be a promising treatment option; and (5) Not generally recommended, where available evidence does not support the routine use of HCT/IECT. The ASTCT will continue to periodically review these guidelines and update them as new evidence becomes available.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Allogeneic transplantation", "Autologous transplantation", "Chimeric antigen receptor T cells", "Hematopoietic cell transplantation", "Immune effector cell therapy", "Indications"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084227379", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"25227388200": {"Name": "Kanate A.S.", "AuthorID": "25227388200", "AffiliationID": "60021143", "AffiliationName": "Hematopoietic Malignancy & Cellular Therapy Program, West Virginia University"}, "6603086929": {"Name": "Majhail N.S.", "AuthorID": "6603086929", "AffiliationID": "60021160", "AffiliationName": "Blood & Marrow Transplant Program, Cleveland Clinic"}, "8201359700": {"Name": "Savani B.N.", "AuthorID": "8201359700", "AffiliationID": "60030769", "AffiliationName": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "6701788573": {"Name": "Bredeson C.", "AuthorID": "6701788573", "AffiliationID": "60002173, 60028897", "AffiliationName": "Division of Hematology, University of Ottawa and Ottawa Hospital Research Institute"}, "57202963538": {"Name": "Champlin R.E.", "AuthorID": "57202963538", "AffiliationID": "60015023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center"}, "7202195125": {"Name": "Crawford S.", "AuthorID": "7202195125", "AffiliationID": "60011850", "AffiliationName": "Cigna LifeSource Transplant Network"}, "7007002240": {"Name": "Giralt S.A.", "AuthorID": "7007002240", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"}, "35430259800": {"Name": "LeMaistre C.F.", "AuthorID": "35430259800", "AffiliationID": "113120402", "AffiliationName": "Sarah Cannon"}, "7202505808": {"Name": "Marks D.I.", "AuthorID": "7202505808", "AffiliationID": "60170515", "AffiliationName": "Adult BMT Unit, University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36545176500": {"Name": "Omel J.L.", "AuthorID": "36545176500", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Grand Island"}, "7003563305": {"Name": "Orchard P.J.", "AuthorID": "7003563305", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota"}, "42962208500": {"Name": "Palmer J.", "AuthorID": "42962208500", "AffiliationID": "60026952", "AffiliationName": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, Mayo Clinic"}, "23976412000": {"Name": "Saber W.", "AuthorID": "23976412000", "AffiliationID": "101558750", "AffiliationName": "Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research"}, "10739126800": {"Name": "Hamadani M.", "AuthorID": "10739126800", "AffiliationID": "101558750", "AffiliationName": "Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research"}, "57203102921": {"Name": "Veys P.A.", "AuthorID": "57203102921", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "35392998100": {"Name": "Carpenter P.A.", "AuthorID": "35392998100", "AffiliationID": "60003625", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"}}}
