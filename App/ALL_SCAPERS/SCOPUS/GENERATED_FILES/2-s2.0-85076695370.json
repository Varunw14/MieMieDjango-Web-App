They are currently viewed as best practice in the UK and elsewhere. However, as service provision is fragmented, some women residing in areas without MBUs are admitted to acute general psychiatric wards without their infants. This study aimed to compare qualitatively experiences of these two service types from the perspectives of women and clinicians. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with fifteen women who received treatment for perinatal mental health problems on a general psychiatric ward and/or MBU in England. Two focus groups were also conducted, one with MBU staff (n = 11) and one with acute ward staff (n = 6). Data were analysed thematically. Results: Women generally preferred being co-admitted with their baby to an MBU over lone admission to a general psychiatric ward. Women and clinicians felt that MBUs provided more perinatally-focused, family-centred care, and were better-equipped to meet women's needs. General wards were reported by women and staff to lack the necessary facilities and expertise to support perinatal women adequately, while separation of mothers and babies was often experienced by women as traumatic and detrimental to recovery. However, some areas for improvement were also identified across both service types, particularly relating to difficulties transitioning home post-discharge, inadequate support for family members, staffing issues and access problems (with MBUs). Conclusions: Findings suggest that specialist perinatal inpatient care is considered preferable to generic care in the perinatal period from both service user and staff perspectives. Increased collaboration between perinatal and non-perinatal services could help improve perinatal expertise on general psychiatric wards, while further expansion of perinatal services (e.g. to cater for women currently considered too high risk for MBUs and for those discharged from inpatient settings) could tackle other shortfalls in care.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acute psychiatric ward", "Mental health", "Mother and baby unit", "Perinatal", "Qualitative", "Women"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "England", "Female", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Inpatients", "Maternal Health", "Maternal Health Services", "Mental Disorders", "Mental Health Services", "Mothers", "Patient Discharge", "Patients' Rooms", "Perinatal Care", "Postpartum Period", "Pregnancy", "Psychiatric Department, Hospital"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076695370", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57212454997": {"Name": "Griffiths J.", "AuthorID": "57212454997", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London, Maple House"}, "56418502300": {"Name": "Lever Taylor B.", "AuthorID": "56418502300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London, Maple House"}, "6603484587": {"Name": "Morant N.", "AuthorID": "6603484587", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London, Maple House"}, "7406331085": {"Name": "Johnson S.", "AuthorID": "7406331085", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London, Maple House"}, "55859601200": {"Name": "Bick D.", "AuthorID": "55859601200", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Clinical Trials Unit, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick, Gibbet Hill"}, "7202645145": {"Name": "Howard L.M.", "AuthorID": "7202645145", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Section of Women's Mental Health, Institute of Psychiatry Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7003703093": {"Name": "Seneviratne G.", "AuthorID": "7003703093", "AffiliationID": "60006579, 60028884", "AffiliationName": "South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust Channi Kumar Mother and Baby Unit, Bethlem Royal Hospital"}}}
