Little is known however about the natural variability in these Vpu functions among the genetically diverse viral subtypes that contribute to the HIV-1 pandemic. We collected Vpu isolates from 332 treatment-naive individuals living with chronic HIV-1 infection in Uganda, Rwanda, South Africa, and Canada. Together, these Vpu isolates represent four major HIV-1 group M subtypes (A [n = 63], B [n = 84], C [n = 94], and D [n = 59]) plus intersubtype recombinants and uncommon strains (n = 32). The ability of each Vpu clone to downregulate endogenous CD4 and tetherin was quantified using flow cytometry following transfection into an immortalized T-cell line and compared to that of a reference Vpu clone derived from HIV-1 subtype B NL4.3. Overall, the median CD4 downregulation function of natural Vpu isolates was similar to that of NL4.3 (1.01 [interquartile range {IQR}, 0.86 to 1.18]), while the median tetherin downregulation function was moderately lower than that of NL4.3 (0.90 [0.79 to 0.97]). Both Vpu functions varied significantly among HIV-1 subtypes (Kruskal-Wallis P < 0.0001). Specifically, subtype C clones exhibited the lowest CD4 and tetherin downregulation activities, while subtype D and B clones were most functional for both activities. We also identified Vpu polymorphisms associated with CD4 or tetherin downregulation function and validated six of these using site-directed mutagenesis. Our results highlight the marked extent to which Vpu function varies among global HIV-1 strains, raising the possibility that natural variation in this accessory protein may contribute to viral pathogenesis and/or spread. IMPORTANCE The HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu enhances viral spread by downregulating CD4 and BST-2/tetherin on the surface of infected cells. Natural variability in these Vpu functions may contribute to HIV-1 pathogenesis, but this has not been investigated among the diverse viral subtypes that contribute to the HIV-1 pandemic. In this study, we found that Vpu function differs significantly among HIV-1 subtypes A, B, C, and D. On average, subtype C clones displayed the lowest ability to downregulate both CD4 and tetherin, while subtype B and D clones were more functional. We also identified Vpu polymorphisms that associate with functional differences among HIV-1 isolates and subtypes. Our study suggests that genetic diversity in Vpu may play an important role in the differential pathogenesis and/or spread of HIV-1.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CD4", "Downregulation", "HIV-1", "Subtype", "Tetherin", "Vpu"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antigens, CD", "CD4 Antigens", "Cell Line, Transformed", "Chronic Disease", "Down-Regulation", "GPI-Linked Proteins", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Human Immunodeficiency Virus Proteins", "Humans", "Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087528859", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Insect Science", "AGRI", "1109"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"43961723700": {"Name": "Umviligihozo G.", "AuthorID": "43961723700", "AffiliationID": "60018491", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser University"}, "56974429000": {"Name": "Cobarrubias K.D.", "AuthorID": "56974429000", "AffiliationID": "60018491", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser University"}, "57190419238": {"Name": "Chandrarathna S.", "AuthorID": "57190419238", "AffiliationID": "60018491", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser University"}, "57192099460": {"Name": "Jin S.W.", "AuthorID": "57192099460", "AffiliationID": "60018491", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser University"}, "6602495373": {"Name": "Brumme Z.L.", "AuthorID": "6602495373", "AffiliationID": "60026960", "AffiliationName": "British, Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS"}, "57205917641": {"Name": "Brockman M.A.", "AuthorID": "57205917641", "AffiliationID": "60026960", "AffiliationName": "British, Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS"}, "57217702966": {"Name": "Reddy N.", "AuthorID": "57217702966", "AffiliationID": "60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute"}, "57204021682": {"Name": "Ndung\u2019u T.", "AuthorID": "57204021682", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "9334135600": {"Name": "Byakwaga H.", "AuthorID": "9334135600", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "University of California"}, "25655228300": {"Name": "Muzoora C.", "AuthorID": "25655228300", "AffiliationID": "60071693", "AffiliationName": "Mbarara University of Science and Technology"}, "12796974700": {"Name": "Bwana M.B.", "AuthorID": "12796974700", "AffiliationID": "60071693", "AffiliationName": "Mbarara University of Science and Technology"}, "7202324398": {"Name": "Hunt P.W.", "AuthorID": "7202324398", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "University of California"}, "7501562043": {"Name": "Martin J.N.", "AuthorID": "7501562043", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "University of California"}, "55369803200": {"Name": "Lee G.Q.", "AuthorID": "55369803200", "AffiliationID": "60026960", "AffiliationName": "British, Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS"}, "57204349508": {"Name": "Brumme C.J.", "AuthorID": "57204349508", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "University of British Columbia"}, "7005550791": {"Name": "Bangsberg D.R.", "AuthorID": "7005550791", "AffiliationID": "60138967", "AffiliationName": "Oregon Health and Science University-Portland State University School of Public Health"}, "7004046660": {"Name": "Karita E.", "AuthorID": "7004046660", "AffiliationID": "113221425", "AffiliationName": "Rwanda Zambia HIV Research Group-Projet San Francisco"}, "55822964344": {"Name": "Allen S.", "AuthorID": "55822964344", "AffiliationID": "60025315, 60000928", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University"}, "57203198774": {"Name": "Hunter E.", "AuthorID": "57203198774", "AffiliationID": "60000928", "AffiliationName": "Emory Vaccine Center at Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Emory University"}}}
