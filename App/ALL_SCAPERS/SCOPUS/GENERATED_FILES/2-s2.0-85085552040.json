A full-scale steel stiffened plate structure in association with plate panels in bottom structures of an as-built containership carrying 1900 TEU was fabricated using exactly the same welding technology as used in today's shipbuilding industry. The X-ray diffraction method was employed to measure the biaxial residual stress distributions in the plating. In addition to simple formula estimations, computational models using the three-dimensional thermo-elastic-plastic finite element method were applied to predict the biaxial residual stress distributions. A comparison between full-scale measurements, numerical predictions and simple formula estimations was made. Details of the full-scale measurements are documented as they can be useful to validate the computational models formulated by other researchers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Full-scale measurements", "Simple formula estimations", "Steel stiffened plate structures", "Three-dimensional thermo-elastic-plastic finite element method", "Welding-induced biaxial residual stresses", "X-ray diffraction method"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085552040", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Architecture", "ENGI", "2216"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"]], "AuthorData": {"55329277500": {"Name": "Yi M.S.", "AuthorID": "55329277500", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "Department of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Pusan National University"}, "57189708535": {"Name": "Noh S.H.", "AuthorID": "57189708535", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "Department of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Pusan National University"}, "57202974921": {"Name": "Lee D.H.", "AuthorID": "57202974921", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "Department of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Pusan National University"}, "57217138675": {"Name": "Seo D.H.", "AuthorID": "57217138675", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "Department of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Pusan National University"}, "35821146600": {"Name": "Paik J.K.", "AuthorID": "35821146600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
