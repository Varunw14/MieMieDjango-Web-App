Rather than redressing the country\u2019s long-standing class divisions, the referendum has exacerbated them by fuelling negative stereotypes and mutual accusations between Leave and Remain supporters. Drawing on psychoanalytic theories of subjectivity, the article argues that support for Leave and Remain is structured by circulations of affect, fantasies of the good life and psychic investments in different experiences of immigration, nationalism, and social and economic inequality.", "AuthorKeywords": ["affect", "immigration", "inequality", "nationalism", "ressentiment"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074608286", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"57195808995": {"Name": "Mintchev N.", "AuthorID": "57195808995", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Prosperity, University College London"}, "7202287031": {"Name": "Moore H.L.", "AuthorID": "7202287031", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Prosperity, University College London"}}}
