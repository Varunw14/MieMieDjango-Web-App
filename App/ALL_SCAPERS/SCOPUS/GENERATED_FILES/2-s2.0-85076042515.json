Yet, there is limited theoretical or empirical analysis of the authorship of current reading lists to justify this imperative. The present study developed and applied a method for auditing the authorship on reading lists of two modules, one from science and one from social science, in a research-intensive British university. The paper explores whether these reading lists can be considered descriptively representative of the student body or scholarly community. The analysis of reading lists found empirical basis for concerns that university curricula are dominated by white, male and Eurocentric authors, with some exceptions. The reading lists did not represent the diverse local student body but came closer to representing the demographic profile of academic staff. To interpret these findings, the paper argues that reading lists have a role to play in decolonising our universities, and offer opportunities to critique and deconstruct disciplinary boundaries. Further research is required to explore student and staff views of reading lists and the meaning of diversity, to evaluate existing tools, and address barriers to decolonising our curricula on a global scale.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Decolonizing the curriculum", "Diversity", "Inclusion", "Reading lists", "Representation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076042515", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"57207662904": {"Name": "Schucan Bird K.", "AuthorID": "57207662904", "AffiliationID": "60117701", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Science, UCL Institute of Education"}, "57212143121": {"Name": "Pitman L.", "AuthorID": "57212143121", "AffiliationID": "105929605", "AffiliationName": null}}}
