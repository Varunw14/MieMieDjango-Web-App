The present study aimed to gather preliminary evidence to support a training programme for young women. Methods: Semi-structured interviews and psychometric questionnaires about social ability were administered to young women with TS aged 16 to 25 years old (n=17) and their parents (n=20). Interview transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Although young women with TS experienced a \u201cwide range of social competencies,\u201d they attributed social challenges to \u201cpersonal and contextual factors.\u201d The magnitude of these challenges to social integration intensified during adolescence. They felt increasingly \u201cout of sync\u201d with their peers. They also considered their social abilities to be better than their parents did; on a scale of autistic traits (rated by parents), half had mild to severe autistic traits. Most expressed interest in taking part in a social skills programme. Conclusion: Young women with TS are aware they experience difficulties in social communication, and they express interest in improving their social skills. Accordingly, social skills training during adolescence would be welcomed by them and their families. Any intervention should take account of their feelings of social dislocation arising from hearing difficulties together with limited recognition, and slow processing, of social cues.", "AuthorKeywords": ["experiences of socialization", "female autism", "sex chromosome aneuploidy", "social competence", "social skills", "Turner syndrome"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074763987", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57191861000": {"Name": "Wolstencroft J.", "AuthorID": "57191861000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7004857206": {"Name": "Skuse D.", "AuthorID": "7004857206", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "9743239400": {"Name": "Mandy W.", "AuthorID": "9743239400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}}}
