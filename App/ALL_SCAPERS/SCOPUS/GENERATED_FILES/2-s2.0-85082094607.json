Materials and Methods: Twelve healthy males (mean [standard deviation] age 22 [4] years) were exposed to four simulated environments (fraction of inspired oxygen [FIO2]: 0.12, 0.145, 0.17, and 0.21) for 45 minutes, in a balanced crossover design. Results: Sample entropy, a tool that quantifies the irregularity of pulse oximetry fluctuations, was used as a measure of SpO2 variability. SpO2 entropy increased as the FIO2 decreased, and there was a strong significant negative correlation between mean SpO2 and its entropy during hypoxic exposure (r = -0.841 to -0.896, p < 0.001). In addition, SpO2 sample entropy, but not mean SpO2, was correlated (r = 0.630-0.760, p < 0.05) with dyspnea in FIO2 0.17, 0.145, and 0.12 and importantly, SpO2 sample entropy at FIO2 0.17 was correlated with dyspnea at FIO2 0.145 (r = 0.811, p < 0.01). Conclusions: These findings suggest that SpO2 variability analysis may have the potential to be used in a clinical setting as a noninvasive measure to identify the negative sequelae of hypoxemia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dyspnea", "oxygen saturation", "pulse oximetry", "sample entropy", "SpO2 variability"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082094607", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"36090945400": {"Name": "Costello J.T.", "AuthorID": "36090945400", "AffiliationID": "60025475", "AffiliationName": "Extreme Environments Laboratory, School of Sport, Health and Exercise Science, University of Portsmouth"}, "57210213483": {"Name": "Williams T.B.", "AuthorID": "57210213483", "AffiliationID": "60025475", "AffiliationName": "Extreme Environments Laboratory, School of Sport, Health and Exercise Science, University of Portsmouth"}, "7003666298": {"Name": "Tipton M.J.", "AuthorID": "7003666298", "AffiliationID": "60025475", "AffiliationName": "Extreme Environments Laboratory, School of Sport, Health and Exercise Science, University of Portsmouth"}, "14022422300": {"Name": "Corbett J.", "AuthorID": "14022422300", "AffiliationID": "60025475", "AffiliationName": "Extreme Environments Laboratory, School of Sport, Health and Exercise Science, University of Portsmouth"}, "57195282113": {"Name": "Bhogal A.S.", "AuthorID": "57195282113", "AffiliationID": "60182839, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Network Physiology Laboratory, UCL Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "57215852823": {"Name": "Bekoe R.", "AuthorID": "57215852823", "AffiliationID": "60182839, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Network Physiology Laboratory, UCL Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "57215852331": {"Name": "Sabir A.", "AuthorID": "57215852331", "AffiliationID": "60182839, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Network Physiology Laboratory, UCL Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "7101619634": {"Name": "Mani A.R.", "AuthorID": "7101619634", "AffiliationID": "60182839, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Network Physiology Laboratory, UCL Division of Medicine, University College London"}}}
