Published by Cambridge University Press.The delayed coalescence of drops with the interface between a moving aqueous layer and an oil phase is investigated in a novel flow channel. Drops are released onto oil-aqueous interfaces moving at velocities from up to. The evolution of the drop shape, the film thickness between the drop and the bulk liquid, and the velocities of the drop surface and the bulk interface were measured with planar laser-induced fluorescence. As the interface speed increases, the drop coalescence is delayed. This is attributed to the lubrication pressure that develops in the draining film. This pressure was calculated by using the drop shape and the tangential velocities of the drop surface and the bulk interface, and was shown to increase with the interface velocity. The film forming between the drop and the bulk liquid has a dimple shape, symmetric about the centreline. With increasing interface velocity, the dimple shifts to the front part of the drop, resulting locally in a low pressure, which leads to film rupture. As the film breaks, 'oil drops on a string' formations are entrained into the water phase, which is rarely seen when a drop coalesces with a stationary liquid-liquid interface. The velocity fields in the drop were investigated with particle image velocimetry. It is found immediately after reaching the interface that the drops accelerate to reach the interface speed. Initially there is a strong internal circulation in the drops, which decays quickly as the drops approach the speed of the interface.", "AuthorKeywords": ["breakup/coalescence", "drops", "multiphase flow"], "IndexKeywords": ["Drop coalescence", "Interface velocity", "Internal circulations", "Liquid-liquid interfaces", "Oil-aqueous interfaces", "Particle image velocimetries", "Planar laser induced fluorescence", "Tangential velocities"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083195283", "SubjectAreas": [["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"57192648628": {"Name": "Dong T.", "AuthorID": "57192648628", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "ThAMeS Multiphase, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57216340795": {"Name": "Wang F.", "AuthorID": "57216340795", "AffiliationID": "100661898", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Institute of Space Long March Vehicle"}, "55499259000": {"Name": "Weheliye W.H.", "AuthorID": "55499259000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "ThAMeS Multiphase, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004488806": {"Name": "Angeli P.", "AuthorID": "7004488806", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "ThAMeS Multiphase, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
