For engineers to design safe floating structures subjected to shipping water it is essential to gain an in-depth understanding of its depth and flow field, and the resulting impact forces. In this work, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is applied to understand the physics of shipping water washing over a stepped platform. We find that the most accurate solutions are obtained with the k\u2212\u03b5 turbulence closure. The hydrodynamic load generated by the shipping water is found to strongly depends on the kinematic energy of the water hitting the step. It is shown that with smaller values of the freeboard a more dynamic flow ensues, with a stronger vortex and larger velocity gradient resulting in deeper shipping water and a larger impact force.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CFD", "Dam-break", "Floating structures", "Green water", "Impact force", "OpenFoam"], "IndexKeywords": ["Floating structures", "Hydrodynamic loads", "In-depth understanding", "Kinematic energy", "Step structure", "Structural problems", "Turbulence closures", "Velocity gradients"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085758521", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"]], "AuthorData": {"57118164500": {"Name": "Khojasteh D.", "AuthorID": "57118164500", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "Water Research Laboratory, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering"}, "6507551928": {"Name": "Glamore W.", "AuthorID": "6507551928", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "Water Research Laboratory, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering"}, "56512160300": {"Name": "Sadat-Noori M.", "AuthorID": "56512160300", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "Water Research Laboratory, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering"}, "56462385700": {"Name": "Tavakoli S.", "AuthorID": "56462385700", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infrastructure Engineering, University of Melbourne"}, "57221519157": {"Name": "Dolatshah A.", "AuthorID": "57221519157", "AffiliationID": "60030804", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Science, Engineering and Technology, Swinburne University of Technology"}, "36117764900": {"Name": "Dashtimanesh A.", "AuthorID": "36117764900", "AffiliationID": "60068861, 60068868", "AffiliationName": "Estonian Maritime Academy, Tallinn University of Technology"}, "57205472132": {"Name": "Huang L.", "AuthorID": "57205472132", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "56261589800": {"Name": "Iglesias G.", "AuthorID": "56261589800", "AffiliationID": "60024779", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Plymouth"}}}
