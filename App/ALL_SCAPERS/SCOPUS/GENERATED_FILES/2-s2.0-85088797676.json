With the aim of exploring peripheral biomarker potential, we have examined DNA methylation patterns in whole blood collected from 284 individuals in the AddNeuroMed study, which included 89 nondemented controls, 86 patients with Alzheimer's disease, and 109 individuals with mild cognitive impairment, including 38 individuals who progressed to Alzheimer's disease within 1 year. We identified significant differentially methylated regions, including 12 adjacent hypermethylated probes in the HOXB6 gene in Alzheimer's disease, which we validated using pyrosequencing. Using weighted gene correlation network analysis, we identified comethylated modules of genes that were associated with key variables such as APOE genotype and diagnosis. In summary, this study represents the first large-scale epigenome-wide association study of Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment using blood. We highlight the differences in various loci and pathways in early disease, suggesting that these patterns relate to cognitive decline at an early stage.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease (AD)", "Biomarker", "Blood", "DNA methylation", "HOXB6", "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI)"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088797676", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"57126129200": {"Name": "Roubroeks J.A.Y.", "AuthorID": "57126129200", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine and Health, University of Exeter"}, "57209188725": {"Name": "Smith A.R.", "AuthorID": "57209188725", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine and Health, University of Exeter"}, "26431542800": {"Name": "Smith R.G.", "AuthorID": "26431542800", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine and Health, University of Exeter"}, "35171140700": {"Name": "Pishva E.", "AuthorID": "35171140700", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "School for Mental Health and Neuroscience (MHeNS), Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology, Maastricht University"}, "55602412500": {"Name": "Hannon E.J.", "AuthorID": "55602412500", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine and Health, University of Exeter"}, "57219048880": {"Name": "Mill J.", "AuthorID": "57219048880", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine and Health, University of Exeter"}, "8854048100": {"Name": "Lunnon K.", "AuthorID": "8854048100", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine and Health, University of Exeter"}, "8976403700": {"Name": "van den Hove D.L.A.", "AuthorID": "8976403700", "AffiliationID": "60012689", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Psychosomatics and Psychotherapy, University of W\u00fcrzburg"}, "57211618186": {"Name": "Ibrahim Z.", "AuthorID": "57211618186", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research, University College London"}, "35956733500": {"Name": "Sattlecker M.", "AuthorID": "35956733500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics and Health Informatics, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IOPPN), King's College London"}, "57219235156": {"Name": "Dobson R.J.B.", "AuthorID": "57219235156", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research, University College London"}, "6701675936": {"Name": "K\u0142oszewska I.", "AuthorID": "6701675936", "AffiliationID": "60006651", "AffiliationName": "Medical University of Lodz"}, "7006313835": {"Name": "Mecocci P.", "AuthorID": "7006313835", "AffiliationID": "60003003, 60016041", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Gerontology and Geriatrics, University of Perugia"}, "57192384661": {"Name": "Soininen H.", "AuthorID": "57192384661", "AffiliationID": "60024252", "AffiliationName": "Neurocenter, Neurology, Kuopio University Hospital"}, "57210241729": {"Name": "Tsolaki M.", "AuthorID": "57210241729", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "1st Department of Neurology, Memory and Dementia Unit, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "7004818575": {"Name": "Vellas B.", "AuthorID": "7004818575", "AffiliationID": "60102124, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM U 558, University of Toulouse"}, "7006588606": {"Name": "Wahlund L.O.", "AuthorID": "7006588606", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "NVS Department, Section for Clinical Geriatrics, Karolinska Institutet"}, "56222844000": {"Name": "Aarsland D.", "AuthorID": "56222844000", "AffiliationID": "60069103", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Age-Related Diseases, Stavanger University Hospital"}, "57193297655": {"Name": "Proitsi P.", "AuthorID": "57193297655", "AffiliationID": "60028884, 60171762, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Mental Health at South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "7004828085": {"Name": "Hodges A.", "AuthorID": "7004828085", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's Health Partners Centre for Neurodegeneration Research, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "8931613700": {"Name": "Newhouse S.J.", "AuthorID": "8931613700", "AffiliationID": "60028884, 60171762, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Mental Health at South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "7005575001": {"Name": "Lovestone S.", "AuthorID": "7005575001", "AffiliationID": "124893727", "AffiliationName": "Current Affiliation at Janssen-Cilag UK"}}}
