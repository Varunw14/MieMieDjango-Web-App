However, the biological factors pre-disposing an individual to develop ADA are poorly characterized. Thus, there is an unmet clinical need for biomarkers to predict the development of immunogenicity, and subsequent treatment failure. Up to 35% of MS patients treated with beta interferons (IFN\u03b2) develop ADA. Here we use machine learning to predict immunogenicity against IFN\u03b2 utilizing serum metabolomics data. Methods: Serum samples were collected from 89 MS patients as part of the ABIRISK consortium\u2014a multi-center prospective study of ADA development. Metabolites and ADA were quantified prior to and after IFN\u03b2 treatment. Thirty patients became ADA positive during the first year of treatment (ADA+). We tested the efficacy of six binary classification models using 10-fold cross validation; k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest, support vector machine and lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) logistic regression with and without interactions. Results: We were able to predict future immunogenicity from baseline metabolomics data. Lasso logistic regression with/without interactions and support vector machines were the most successful at identifying ADA+ or ADA\u2013 cases, respectively. Furthermore, patients who become ADA+ had a distinct metabolic response to IFN\u03b2 in the first 3 months, with 29 differentially regulated metabolites. Machine learning algorithms could also predict ADA status based on metabolite concentrations at 3 months. Lasso logistic regressions had the greatest proportion of correct classifications [F1 score (accuracy measure) = 0.808, specificity = 0.913]. Finally, we hypothesized that serum lipids could contribute to ADA development by altering immune-cell lipid rafts. This was supported by experimental evidence demonstrating that, prior to IFN\u03b2 exposure, lipid raft-associated lipids were differentially expressed between MS patients who became ADA+ or remained ADA\u2013. Conclusion: Serum metabolites are a promising biomarker for prediction of ADA development in MS patients treated with IFN\u03b2, and could provide novel insight into mechanisms of immunogenicity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anti-drug antibodies", "cholesterol", "immunogenicity", "machine learning", "metabolomics", "multiple sclerosis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088988100", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"56767870000": {"Name": "Waddington K.E.", "AuthorID": "56767870000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiometabolic and Vascular Medicine, University College London"}, "57218366773": {"Name": "Papadaki A.", "AuthorID": "57218366773", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology, University College London"}, "57201286608": {"Name": "Coelewij L.", "AuthorID": "57201286608", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiometabolic and Vascular Medicine, University College London"}, "14521831200": {"Name": "Adriani M.", "AuthorID": "14521831200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology, University College London"}, "56487780500": {"Name": "D\u00f6nnes P.", "AuthorID": "56487780500", "AffiliationID": "117633020", "AffiliationName": "Scicross AB"}, "7006321323": {"Name": "Jury E.C.", "AuthorID": "7006321323", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology, University College London"}, "7801465530": {"Name": "Pineda-Torra I.", "AuthorID": "7801465530", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiometabolic and Vascular Medicine, University College London"}, "35311672200": {"Name": "Nytrova P.", "AuthorID": "35311672200", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Centre of Clinical Neuroscience, General University Hospital, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague"}, "57199414195": {"Name": "Kubala Havrdova E.", "AuthorID": "57199414195", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Centre of Clinical Neuroscience, General University Hospital, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague"}, "55937502700": {"Name": "Fogdell-Hahn A.", "AuthorID": "55937502700", "AffiliationID": "60019295, 60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Center for Molecular Medicine (CMM), Karolinska University Hospital"}, "15730994000": {"Name": "Farrell R.", "AuthorID": "15730994000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60019953, 60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroinflammation, University College London, Institute of Neurology and National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
