Unique practical and ethical considerations exist in this patient population that make patient recruitment challenging, including narrow recruitment timeframes and obtaining patient consent often in time-critical situations. Units currently vary significantly in their ability to recruit according to infrastructure and level of research activity. Aim: To identify variability in the research infrastructure of UK intensive care units and their ability to conduct research and recruit patients into clinical trials. Design: We evaluated factors related to intensive care patient enrolment into clinical trials in the UK. This consisted of a qualitative synthesis carried out with two datasets of in-depth interviews (distinct participants across the two datasets) conducted with 27 intensive care consultants (n=9), research nurses (n=17) and trial coordinators (n=1) from 27 units across the UK. Primary and secondary analyses of two datasets (one dataset had been analysed previously) were undertaken in the thematic analysis. Findings: The synthesis yielded an overarching core theme of normalising research, characterised by motivations for promoting research and fostering research-active cultures within resource constraints, with six themes under this to explain the factors influencing critical care research capacity: organisational, human, study, practical resources, clinician and patient/family factors. There was a strong sense of integrating research in routine clinical practice, and recommendations are outlined. Conclusions: The central and transferable tenet of normalising research advocates the importance of developing a culture where research is inclusive alongside clinical practice in routine patient care and is a requisite for all healthcare individuals from organisational to direct patient contact level.", "AuthorKeywords": ["access to research", "barriers", "critical care trials", "facilitators", "normalising research", "qualitative synthesis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Clinical Trials as Topic", "Critical Care", "Humans", "Intensive Care Units", "Patient Selection", "Qualitative Research", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077195837", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"25623599800": {"Name": "Pattison N.", "AuthorID": "25623599800", "AffiliationID": "60027469", "AffiliationName": "East and North Herts NHS Foundation Trust"}, "23975738700": {"Name": "Arulkumaran N.", "AuthorID": "23975738700", "AffiliationID": "100457787", "AffiliationName": "Florence Nightingale Foundation"}, "36239342600": {"Name": "O'gara G.", "AuthorID": "36239342600", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Nursing, Royal Marsden Hospital NHS Trust"}, "55044436900": {"Name": "Connolly B.", "AuthorID": "55044436900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Lane Fox Respiratory Unit, King's College London"}, "57193199649": {"Name": "Humphreys S.", "AuthorID": "57193199649", "AffiliationID": "60014768", "AffiliationName": "Critical Care, West Suffolk Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "7402024083": {"Name": "Walsh T.", "AuthorID": "7402024083", "AffiliationID": "60027272, 60002975", "AffiliationName": "Critical Care, University of Edinburgh Royal Infirmary Edinburgh"}, "8785948600": {"Name": "Hopkins P.", "AuthorID": "8785948600", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Critical Care, Kings College Hospital"}, "6603928668": {"Name": "Dark P.", "AuthorID": "6603928668", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Intensive Care Unit, University of Manchester"}}}
