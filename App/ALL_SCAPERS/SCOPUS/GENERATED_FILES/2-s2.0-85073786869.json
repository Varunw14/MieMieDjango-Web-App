We assessed the neuroprotective efficacy of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) bolus and infusion over 48 h plus HT in a piglet model of term neonatal encephalopathy (NE). Methods: Fifteen newborn piglets were randomized following hypoxia\u2013ischemia (HI) to: (i) MgSO4 180 mg/kg bolus and 8 mg/kg/h infusion with HT (Mg+HT) or (ii) HT and saline 0.5 ml/h (HT). Treatments were initiated 1 h post-HI; HT administered for 12 h (33.5 \u00b0C). HI was performed by transient carotid occlusion and inhalation of 6% O2 for 20\u201325 min. Primary outcomes included aEEG, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) at 24, and 48 h, and immunohistochemistry. Results: MgSO4 bolus and infusion was well tolerated (no hypotension) and doubled serum magnesium (0.72 vs 1.52 mmol/L) with modest (16%) rise in CSF. In Mg+HT compared to HT, there was overall reduced cell death (p = 0.01) and increased oligodendrocytes (p = 0.002). No improvement was seen on aEEG recovery (p = 0.084) or MRS (Lac/NAA; PCr/Pi; NTP/epp) (p > 0.05) at 48 h. Conclusion: Doubling serum magnesium with HT was safe; however, the small incremental benefit of Mg+HT compared to HT is unlikely to translate into substantive long-term improvement. Such an incremental effect might justify further study of MgSO4 in combination with multiple therapies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Animals, Newborn", "Blood Gas Analysis", "Combined Modality Therapy", "Electroencephalography", "Hypothermia, Induced", "Hypoxia-Ischemia, Brain", "Magnesium", "Magnesium Sulfate", "Male", "Neuroprotective Agents", "Swine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073786869", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"57105634000": {"Name": "Lingam I.", "AuthorID": "57105634000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neonatology, Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "57204243750": {"Name": "Meehan C.", "AuthorID": "57204243750", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neonatology, Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "55356573700": {"Name": "Avdic-Belltheus A.", "AuthorID": "55356573700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neonatology, Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "57194586538": {"Name": "Martinello K.", "AuthorID": "57194586538", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neonatology, Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "22937760400": {"Name": "Hristova M.", "AuthorID": "22937760400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neonatology, Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "7102941268": {"Name": "Robertson N.J.", "AuthorID": "7102941268", "AffiliationID": "60107609, 60106067", "AffiliationName": "Neonatology, Sidra Medicine"}, "57191341272": {"Name": "Kaynezhad P.", "AuthorID": "57191341272", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57211405825": {"Name": "Bauer C.", "AuthorID": "57211405825", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "6507301690": {"Name": "Tachtsidis I.", "AuthorID": "6507301690", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004309393": {"Name": "Golay X.", "AuthorID": "7004309393", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
