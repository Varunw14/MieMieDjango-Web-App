To analyse this problem we derive analytical upheaval buckling solutions and obtain the locations of maximum displacement and maximum axial compressive stress. We also analyse the typical post-buckling behaviour and its dependence on step height, axial soil resistance and wall thickness. The difference in behaviour between a pipeline with step imperfection and one with a symmetric prop imperfection is discussed. Our results show that a pipeline with a step imperfection is more prone to upheaval buckling than a perfect pipeline. For sufficiently small step heights the pipeline may suffer a snap-back instability under decreasing thermal loading, raising the possibility of hysteretic snap behaviour under cyclic thermal loading (for instance caused by periodic start-ups and shut-downs). The snap-back buckling disappears for large enough step height and the minimum critical temperature difference decreases with increasing step height and wall thickness or with decreasing axial soil resistance. The maximum compressive stress decreases with increasing step height and axial soil resistance or with decreasing wall thickness. A pipeline with step imperfection is safer than one with a symmetric prop imperfection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Snap buckling", "Step imperfection", "Subsea pipelines", "Upheaval buckling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Axial-compressive stress", "Critical temperature difference", "Cyclic thermal loading", "High temperature and high pressure", "Snap buckling", "Snap-back instabilities", "Sub-sea pipelines", "Upheaval buckling"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072267700", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"56159250900": {"Name": "Wang Z.", "AuthorID": "56159250900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "7005973659": {"Name": "van der Heijden G.", "AuthorID": "7005973659", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
