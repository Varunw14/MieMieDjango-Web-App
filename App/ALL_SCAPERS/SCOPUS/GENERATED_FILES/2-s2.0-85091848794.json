The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.Turbulence, a ubiquitous phenomenon in interplanetary space, is crucial for the energy conversion of space plasma at multiple scales. This work focuses on the propagation, polarization, and wave composition properties of the solar wind turbulence within 0.3 au, and its variation with heliocentric distance at magnetohydrodynamic scales (from 10 s to 1000 s in the spacecraft frame). We present the probability density function of propagation wavevectors (PDF (k \u2225, k \u22a5)) for solar wind turbulence within 0.3 au for the first time: (1) wavevectors cluster quasi-(anti-)parallel to the local background magnetic field for kd i < 0.02, where d i is the ion inertial length; (2) wavevectors shift to quasi-perpendicular directions for kd i > 0.02. Based on our wave composition diagnosis, we find that: the outward/anti-sunward Alfv\u00e9n mode dominates over the whole range of scales and distances, the spectral energy density fraction of the inward/sunward fast mode decreases with distance, and the fractional energy densities of the inward and outward slow mode increase with distance. The outward fast mode and inward Alfv\u00e9n mode represent minority populations throughout the explored range of distances and scales. On average, the degree of anisotropy of the magnetic fluctuations defined with respect to the minimum variation direction decreases with increasing scale, with no trend in distance at any scale. Our results provide comprehensive insight into the scenario of transport and transfer of the solar wind fluctuations/turbulence in the inner heliosphere.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091848794", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57206776136": {"Name": "Zhu X.", "AuthorID": "57206776136", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Space Sciences, Peking University"}, "57207806298": {"Name": "He J.", "AuthorID": "57207806298", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Space Sciences, Peking University"}, "57193328885": {"Name": "Duan D.", "AuthorID": "57193328885", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Space Sciences, Peking University"}, "24503852100": {"Name": "Verscharen D.", "AuthorID": "24503852100", "AffiliationID": "60027576", "AffiliationName": "Space Science Center, University of New Hampshire"}, "57219106480": {"Name": "Bale S.D.", "AuthorID": "57219106480", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
