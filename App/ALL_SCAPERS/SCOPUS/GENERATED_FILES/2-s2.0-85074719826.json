Automation in this context is distinct from standard procedures in industry, where the identical sequence of operations can be repeated over and over again. Ultraprecision tolerances may be tens to hundreds of times tighter, and this is compounded by the hundreds of diverse substrate materials in use. Even with modern computer numerically controlled (CNC) machines, skilled craftspeople are needed to plan a process-chain for a new material or geometry. Processes working at these tight tolerances, fall short of being fully-deterministic, so repeated process-metrology iterations are required. Surface-correction loops may be automated, but expert assessment should be performed at each step to check for unexpected anomalies. The ultimate goal of importing a part, processing autonomously, and delivering a finished part to an \u201coptical\u201d specification with no human intervention, is still a long way off. This paper describes the challenge and why it is important. It then melds together process-monitoring, psychology, artificial intelligence and robotics, to take a far-sighted view of how the ultimate goal can be realised.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Artificial-intelligence", "Automated", "Autonomous", "Manufacturing", "Optics", "Polishing", "Surfaces"], "IndexKeywords": ["Automated", "Autonomous", "Computer numerically controlled machines", "Expert assessment", "Human intervention", "Standard procedures", "Substrate material", "Surface corrections"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074719826", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"7404441122": {"Name": "Walker D.D.", "AuthorID": "7404441122", "AffiliationID": "60032343", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Ultra Precision Surfaces, University of Huddersfield"}, "57201438378": {"Name": "Yu G.", "AuthorID": "57201438378", "AffiliationID": "60032343", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Ultra Precision Surfaces, University of Huddersfield"}, "54581218000": {"Name": "Li H.", "AuthorID": "54581218000", "AffiliationID": "60019616", "AffiliationName": "Research Center for Space Optical Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology"}, "6601969767": {"Name": "McCluskey T.L.", "AuthorID": "6601969767", "AffiliationID": "60032343", "AffiliationName": "University of Huddersfield"}, "7101905858": {"Name": "Petrovic S.", "AuthorID": "7101905858", "AffiliationID": "60116647", "AffiliationName": "Nottingham University Business School, Jubilee Campus"}}}
