In so doing, speculative architecture is conceived of as a discursive space for social performance and capital accumulation under conditions of late capitalism. I examine how a set of semiotic and discursive features that become emblematic of \u201cdoing speculative architecture\u201d get \u201cenregistered\u201d or \u201cstylised\u201d in ways that regulate access to socio-institutional networks and associated material/symbolic resources. This approach is intended to shed light on the semiotic production of new professional selves while at the same time identifying the embedded forms of inequality that these may enable.", "AuthorKeywords": ["enregisterment", "political economy", "professional selves", "Speculative architecture", "stylisation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089905905", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"36622769900": {"Name": "P\u00e9rez-Milans M.", "AuthorID": "36622769900", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Applied Linguistics, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
