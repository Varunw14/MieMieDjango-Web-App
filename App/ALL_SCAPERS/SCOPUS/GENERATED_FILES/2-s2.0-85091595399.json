Shortened paper and verbal assessments predominate but still are not used routinely. Computer-based tests are becoming more widespread; however, changes in how a paper test is implemented can impact what exactly is being assessed in an individual. The Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) is one validated test that forms part of the cognitive batteries used in MS and has some computer-based versions. We developed a tablet-based SDMT variant that has the potential to be ultimately deployed to patients\u2019 own devices. Objective: This paper aims to develop, validate, and deploy a computer-based SDMT variant, the Cognition Reaction (CoRe) test, that can reliably replicate the characteristics of the paper-based SDMT. Methods: We carried out analysis using Pearson and intraclass correlations, as well as a Bland-Altman comparison, to examine consistency between the SDMT and CoRe tests and for test-retest reliability. The SDMT and CoRe tests were evaluated for sensitivity to disability levels and age. A novel metric in CoRe was found: question answering velocity could be calculated. This was evaluated in relation to disability levels and age for people with MS and compared with a group of healthy control volunteers. Results: SDMT and CoRe test scores were highly correlated and consistent with 1-month retest values. Lower scores were seen in patients with higher age and some effect was seen with increasing disability. There was no learning effect evident. Question answering velocity demonstrated a small increase in speed over the 90-second duration of the test in people with MS and healthy controls. Conclusions: This study validates a computer-based alternative to the SDMT that can be used in clinics and beyond. It enables accurate recording of elements of cognition relevant in MS but offers additional metrics that may offer further value to clinicians and people with MS.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cognition", "EHealth", "Electronic assessment", "Multiple sclerosis", "Neurology", "Patient reported outcomes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cognition Disorders", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Reproducibility of Results"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091595399", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"55325031200": {"Name": "Middleton R.M.", "AuthorID": "55325031200", "AffiliationID": "60170471, 60004572", "AffiliationName": "Population Data Science, Swansea University Medical School, Swansea University"}, "57219140602": {"Name": "Craig E.M.", "AuthorID": "57219140602", "AffiliationID": "60170471, 60004572", "AffiliationName": "Population Data Science, Swansea University Medical School, Swansea University"}, "57202291499": {"Name": "Rodgers W.J.", "AuthorID": "57202291499", "AffiliationID": "60170471, 60004572", "AffiliationName": "Population Data Science, Swansea University Medical School, Swansea University"}, "56807194400": {"Name": "Tuite-Dalton K.", "AuthorID": "56807194400", "AffiliationID": "60170471, 60004572", "AffiliationName": "Population Data Science, Swansea University Medical School, Swansea University"}, "57214140759": {"Name": "Roberts C.", "AuthorID": "57214140759", "AffiliationID": "60170471, 60004572", "AffiliationName": "Population Data Science, Swansea University Medical School, Swansea University"}, "26221759700": {"Name": "Ford D.V.", "AuthorID": "26221759700", "AffiliationID": "60170471, 60004572", "AffiliationName": "Population Data Science, Swansea University Medical School, Swansea University"}, "55187006100": {"Name": "Pearson O.R.", "AuthorID": "55187006100", "AffiliationID": "60031920, 60138360", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Morriston Hospital, Swansea Bay National Health Service Trust"}, "23466926900": {"Name": "Ingram G.", "AuthorID": "23466926900", "AffiliationID": "60031920, 60138360", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Morriston Hospital, Swansea Bay National Health Service Trust"}, "57220606855": {"Name": "Watson L.", "AuthorID": "57220606855", "AffiliationID": "60031920, 60138360", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Morriston Hospital, Swansea Bay National Health Service Trust"}, "57219180181": {"Name": "Downing-Wood H.", "AuthorID": "57219180181", "AffiliationID": "60012558, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Charing Cross Hospital, Imperial College London"}, "57219176215": {"Name": "Hill J.", "AuthorID": "57219176215", "AffiliationID": "60012558, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Charing Cross Hospital, Imperial College London"}, "15768161200": {"Name": "Nicholas R.", "AuthorID": "15768161200", "AffiliationID": "60012558, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Charing Cross Hospital, Imperial College London"}}}
