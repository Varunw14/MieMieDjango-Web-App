The role of massive stars is central to an understanding of galactic ecology. It is important to establish the details of how massive stars provide radiative, chemical, and mechanical feedback in galaxies. Central to these issues is an understanding of the evolution of massive stars, and the critical role of mass loss via strongly structured winds and stellar binarity. Ultimately, and acting collectively, massive stellar clusters shape the structure and energetics of galaxies. Aims. We aim to conduct high-resolution, deep field mapping at 21 cm of the core of the massive Cygnus OB2 association and to characterise the properties of the massive stars and colliding winds at this waveband. Methods. We used seven stations of the e-MERLIN radio facility, with its upgraded bandwidth and enhanced sensitivity to conduct a 21 cm census of Cygnus OB2. Based on 42 hours of observations, seven overlapping pointings were employed over multiple epochs during 2014 resulting in 1\u03c3 sensitivities down to \u223c21 \u03bcJy and a resolution of \u223c180 mas. Results. A total of 61 sources are detected at 21 cm over a \u223c0.48\u00b0 \u00d7 0.48\u00b0 region centred on the heart of the Cyg OB2 association. Of these 61 sources, 33 are detected for the first time. We detect a number of previously identified sources including four massive stellar binary systems, two YSOs, and several known X-ray and radio sources. We also detect the LBV candidate (possible binary system) and blue hypergiant star of Cyg OB2 #12. Conclusions. The 21 cm observations secured in the COBRaS Legacy project provide data to constrain conditions in the outer wind regions of massive stars; determine the non-thermal properties of massive interacting binaries; examine evidence for transient sources, including those associated with young stellar objects; and provide unidentified sources that merit follow-up observations. The 21 cm data are of lasting value and will serve in combination with other key surveys of Cyg OB2, including Chandra and Spitzer.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Open clusters and associations: individual: Cygnus OB2", "Radio continuum: stars", "Stars: massive", "Stars: winds, outflows", "Techniques: interferometric"], "IndexKeywords": ["Binary systems", "Colliding winds", "Constrain condition", "Enhanced sensitivity", "High resolution", "Stellar cluster", "Structure and energetics", "Young stellar objects"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092016329", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57193788870": {"Name": "Morford J.C.", "AuthorID": "57193788870", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "14015662700": {"Name": "Fenech D.M.", "AuthorID": "14015662700", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Astrophysics Group, Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "7003915827": {"Name": "Prinja R.K.", "AuthorID": "7003915827", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7401624063": {"Name": "Yates J.A.", "AuthorID": "7401624063", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "6603625257": {"Name": "Blomme R.", "AuthorID": "6603625257", "AffiliationID": "60068576", "AffiliationName": "Royal Observatory of Belgium"}, "7201816814": {"Name": "Drake J.J.", "AuthorID": "7201816814", "AffiliationID": "60020680", "AffiliationName": "Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics"}, "7406225739": {"Name": "Smith H.A.", "AuthorID": "7406225739", "AffiliationID": "60020680", "AffiliationName": "Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics"}, "7004237751": {"Name": "Eyres S.P.S.", "AuthorID": "7004237751", "AffiliationID": "60017826", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Computing Engineering and Science, University of South Wales"}, "7402299628": {"Name": "Richards A.M.S.", "AuthorID": "7402299628", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "UK ARC Node, JBCA, University of Manchester"}, "7004404967": {"Name": "Stevens I.R.", "AuthorID": "7004404967", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Birmingham"}, "8859075500": {"Name": "Wright N.J.", "AuthorID": "8859075500", "AffiliationID": "60030210", "AffiliationName": "Astrophysics Group Leonard-Jones Building, Keele University"}, "35355525300": {"Name": "Clark J.S.", "AuthorID": "35355525300", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physical Sciences, Open University"}, "7004905604": {"Name": "Dougherty S.", "AuthorID": "7004905604", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "ALMA"}, "7005714417": {"Name": "Pittard J.M.", "AuthorID": "7005714417", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leeds"}, "57205940294": {"Name": "Vink J.S.", "AuthorID": "57205940294", "AffiliationID": "60014022", "AffiliationName": "Armagh Observatory College Hill"}}}
