The objective of this trial was to assess the feasibility of supplying free e-cigarette starter kits to smokers accessing homeless centres and to estimate parameters to inform a possible future larger trial. In this feasibility cluster trial, four homeless centres in Great Britain were non-randomly allocated to either a Usual Care (UC) or E-Cigarette (EC) arm. Smokers attending the centres were recruited by staff. UC arm participants (N = 32) received advice to quit and signposting to the local Stop Smoking Service. EC arm participants (N = 48) received an EC starter kit and 4-weeks supply of e-liquid. Outcome measures were recruitment and retention rates, use of ECs, smoking cessation/reduction and completion of measures required for economic evaluation. Eighty (mean age 43 years; 65% male) of the 153 eligible participants who were invited to participate, were successfully recruited (52%) within a five-month period, and 47 (59%) of these were retained at 24 weeks. The EC intervention was well received with minimal negative effects and very few unintended consequences (e.g. lost, theft, adding illicit substances). In both study arm, depression and anxiety scores declined over the duration of the study. Substance dependence scores remained constant. Assuming those with missing follow up data were smoking, CO validated sustained abstinence at 24 weeks was 3/48 (6.25%) and 0/32 (0%) respectively for the EC and UC arms. Almost all participants present at follow-up visits completed data collection for healthcare service and health-related quality of life measures. Providing an e-cigarette starter kit to smokers experiencing homelessness was associated with reasonable recruitment and retention rates and promising evidence of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Health Behavior", "Homeless Persons", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Outcome Assessment, Health Care", "Prevalence", "Retention in Care", "Smoking", "Smoking Cessation", "Socioeconomic Factors", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094615598", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"6506951935": {"Name": "Dawkins L.", "AuthorID": "6506951935", "AffiliationID": "60031237", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Addictive Behaviours Research, London South Bank University"}, "57195243451": {"Name": "Tyler A.", "AuthorID": "57195243451", "AffiliationID": "60031237", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Addictive Behaviours Research, London South Bank University"}, "57191226819": {"Name": "Cox S.", "AuthorID": "57191226819", "AffiliationID": "60031237", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Addictive Behaviours Research, London South Bank University"}, "55888724100": {"Name": "Bauld L.", "AuthorID": "55888724100", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Usher Institute and SPECTRUM Consortium, Old Medical School, University of Edinburgh"}, "42261270800": {"Name": "Ford A.", "AuthorID": "42261270800", "AffiliationID": "60025200", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Social Marketing and Health, Faculty of Health Sciences and Sport, University of Stirling"}, "56650072600": {"Name": "Best C.", "AuthorID": "56650072600", "AffiliationID": "60025200", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Social Marketing and Health, Faculty of Health Sciences and Sport, University of Stirling"}, "57204495469": {"Name": "Uny I.", "AuthorID": "57204495469", "AffiliationID": "60025200", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Social Marketing and Health, Faculty of Health Sciences and Sport, University of Stirling"}, "57213617623": {"Name": "Robson D.", "AuthorID": "57213617623", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "National Addiction Centre, SPECTRUM Consortium, Addictions Department, ARC South London, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "7102231308": {"Name": "Hajek P.", "AuthorID": "7102231308", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "8342965100": {"Name": "Parrott S.", "AuthorID": "8342965100", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of York"}, "56580778500": {"Name": "Li J.", "AuthorID": "56580778500", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of York"}}}
