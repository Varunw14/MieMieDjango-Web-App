Methods: Twenty-five patients diagnosed with osteoradionecrosis of the jaws treated with pentoxifylline 400 mg + tocopherol 400 mg three times daily (tid) were evaluated. Clinical records and image tests were reviewed. All patients were previously submitted to head and neck radiation therapy and presented with a clinical and radiographic diagnosis of osteoradionecrosis of the jaws. Results: Following therapy with pentoxifylline and tocopherol, 76% (19/25) of the patients showed complete mucosal healing, in which 47.3% (9/19) did not undergo sequestrectomy. From this particular group, 77.7% (7/9) were in stage I and 33.3% (3/9) used the protocol for up to 3 months. Among those who underwent to sequestrectomy, complete mucosal healing was observed in 52.7% (10/19). Among these, 60% (6/10) were in stage I and 100% of the patients were using the protocol for more than 3 months. In all other patients, partial healing of the mucosa was observed since they presented advanced disease. These represented 24% of the sample (6/25), 66.6% (4/6) were in stage III, and 60% (4/6) used the protocol for over 6 months. Conclusion: Pentoxifylline and tocopherol may provide effective management of osteoradionecrosis of the jaws, and the association with sequestrectomy may avoid major surgical procedures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Osteoradionecrosis", "Pentoxifylline", "Radiotherapy", "Tocopherol"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094154427", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"57219592686": {"Name": "dos Anjos R.S.", "AuthorID": "57219592686", "AffiliationID": "100770894", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oral Oncology, Hospital of Cancer of Pernambuco (HCP \u2013 PE)"}, "57219594607": {"Name": "de P\u00e1dua Walfrido G.N.", "AuthorID": "57219594607", "AffiliationID": "100770894", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oral Oncology, Hospital of Cancer of Pernambuco (HCP \u2013 PE)"}, "55515220200": {"Name": "de Hollanda Valente R.O.", "AuthorID": "55515220200", "AffiliationID": "100770894", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oral Oncology, Hospital of Cancer of Pernambuco (HCP \u2013 PE)"}, "36627770400": {"Name": "Silva I.H.M.", "AuthorID": "36627770400", "AffiliationID": "100739009", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Odontologia Cl\u00ednica, Hospital de C\u00e2ncer de Pernambuco"}, "24468212200": {"Name": "Gueiros L.A.", "AuthorID": "24468212200", "AffiliationID": "60031482", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Preventive Dentistry, Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE)"}, "55430746800": {"Name": "Carvalho A.A.T.", "AuthorID": "55430746800", "AffiliationID": "60031482", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Preventive Dentistry, Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE)"}, "7003789865": {"Name": "Le\u00e3o J.C.", "AuthorID": "7003789865", "AffiliationID": "60031482", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Preventive Dentistry, Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE)"}, "57219601958": {"Name": "Patel P.", "AuthorID": "57219601958", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Prosthodontics UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "7201730425": {"Name": "Porter S.", "AuthorID": "7201730425", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Oral Medicine, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}}}
