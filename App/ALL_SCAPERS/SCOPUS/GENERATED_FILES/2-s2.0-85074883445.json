Stroke is a major risk factor for dementia, and along with other risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes, is more common among Black, Asian and other ethnic minorities (BAME). We aimed to explore whether diagnosed dementia differed by ethnicity among adult stroke survivors. Methodology Using the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink and linked hospital data, we conducted a cohort study among patients aged \u226540 years who had an incident stroke between 2005 and 2016. We fitted multivariable Cox proportional hazard models to estimate ethnic differences in the risk of poststroke dementia, adjusting for major clinical and social confounders. Results Our cohort comprised 45 474 stroke survivors (mean age 72.6 years, 49% female), of whom 95.7% were White, 2.0% South Asian, 1.2% Black and 1.1% of Mixed/Other ethnicity. Of these, 4624 (10.2%) were diagnosed with poststroke dementia over a median follow-up of 3.26 years. Compared with the White ethnic group, those of Black ethnicity were 42% more likely to be diagnosed with dementia (adjusted HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.93). There was no association between any other ethnic group and poststroke dementia diagnosis. Discussion There was good evidence that those of Black ethnicity had higher risk of diagnosed dementia poststroke. Further understanding of the mechanisms of this relationship could help target interventions at communities most at risk of dementia poststroke.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dementia", "epidemiology", "ethnicity", "stroke"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "African Americans", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Asian Continental Ancestry Group", "Cohort Studies", "Dementia", "Ethnic Groups", "European Continental Ancestry Group", "Female", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Male", "Memory", "Middle Aged", "Risk Factors", "Stroke", "United States"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074883445", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57074013100": {"Name": "Shiekh S.I.", "AuthorID": "57074013100", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Non-Communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health"}, "38061411100": {"Name": "Forbes H.", "AuthorID": "38061411100", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Non-Communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health"}, "55497026300": {"Name": "Mathur R.", "AuthorID": "55497026300", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Non-Communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health"}, "7003651182": {"Name": "Smeeth L.", "AuthorID": "7003651182", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Non-Communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health"}, "23471079400": {"Name": "Warren-Gash C.", "AuthorID": "23471079400", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Non-Communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health"}, "57212596095": {"Name": "Pearce N.", "AuthorID": "57212596095", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Statistics, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health"}}}
