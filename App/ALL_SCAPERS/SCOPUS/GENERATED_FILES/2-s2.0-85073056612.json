It undergoes a first-order order-disorder structural phase transition at T0 \u223c167K, considered as the improper ferroelectric one. The complex mechanism of this phase transition is attributed to the ordering of the hydrogen bonds between (CH3)2NH2 + (DMA+) and the formate groups as well as distortion of the zinc-formate framework. Here, the analysis of the impact of zinc substitution by Cu doping on the order-disorder phase transition is presented. The Jahn-Teller effect of Cu2+ ions results in a local framework distortion, which consequently perturbs the structural dynamics. Based on the dielectric, thermal, structural, electron paramagnetic resonance, and IR spectroscopy measurements, it is shown that doping with Cu2+ ions leads to a decrease of the phase transition entropy and temperature as well as a change in the nature of the phase transition.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Complex mechanisms", "Dimethylammonium", "Improper ferroelectrics", "Metal formates", "Metal organic framework", "Order disorder phase transitions", "Structural phase transition", "Transition entropies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073056612", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"]], "AuthorData": {"57194898634": {"Name": "Peksa P.", "AuthorID": "57194898634", "AffiliationID": "60019987", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Fundamental Problems of Technology, Wroc\u0142aw University of Science and Technology"}, "13106271700": {"Name": "Trzmiel J.", "AuthorID": "13106271700", "AffiliationID": "60019987", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Fundamental Problems of Technology, Wroc\u0142aw University of Science and Technology"}, "57211231514": {"Name": "Fedoruk K.", "AuthorID": "57211231514", "AffiliationID": "60019987", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Fundamental Problems of Technology, Wroc\u0142aw University of Science and Technology"}, "8678738100": {"Name": "Sieradzki A.", "AuthorID": "8678738100", "AffiliationID": "60019987", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Fundamental Problems of Technology, Wroc\u0142aw University of Science and Technology"}, "57202635813": {"Name": "Gagor A.", "AuthorID": "57202635813", "AffiliationID": "60089023, 60014383", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Low Temperature and Structure Research, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "56167731300": {"Name": "Ciupa A.", "AuthorID": "56167731300", "AffiliationID": "60089023, 60014383", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Low Temperature and Structure Research, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "15725818100": {"Name": "MacZka M.", "AuthorID": "15725818100", "AffiliationID": "60089023, 60014383", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Low Temperature and Structure Research, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "55865561500": {"Name": "\u0160imenas M.", "AuthorID": "55865561500", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Physics, Vilnius University"}, "7003687871": {"Name": "Banys J.", "AuthorID": "7003687871", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Physics, Vilnius University"}, "8071982500": {"Name": "Pawlus S.", "AuthorID": "8071982500", "AffiliationID": "60006225", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics, University of Silesia"}}}
