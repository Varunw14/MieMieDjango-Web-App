RARNU with bladder cuff excision and subsequent MMC bladder instillation to reduce recurrence risk is the \u2018gold standard\u2019 for high-risk upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UUTUC). We adapted a RARNU technique with precise distal ureteric dissection, bladder cuff excision and watertight bladder closure. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all patients undergoing RARNU for UUTUC at our centre performed as a standardised transperitoneal procedure comprising of: bladder cuff excision, two-layer watertight closure and intraoperative bladder leak test; without re-docking/re-positioning of the robotic surgical system. Patient demographics, the timing of MMC instillation, adverse events (surgical and potentially MMC-related) and length of stay (LOS) were assessed according to the Clavien\u2013Dindo classification. Results: A total of 69 patients underwent a RARNU with instillation of MMC. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 70 (62\u201378) years. The median (IQR) day of MMC instillation was 2 (1\u20133) days and the median (IQR) LOS was 2 (2\u20134) days, with urethral catheter removal on day of discharge in all cases. Only Grade I Clavien\u2013Dindo complications occurred in seven patients (10%); five had ileus, one a wound infection and one a self-limiting delirium, all managed conservatively. No adverse events potentially related to MMC instillation were noted within 30 days postoperatively. Conclusion: The use of intravesical MMC instillation given in the immediate postoperative period appears feasible and safe in patients undergoing RARNU with intraoperative confirmation of a water-tight closure ensuring early catheter-free discharge, with no significant adverse events. The potential reduction in intravesical recurrence in patients receiving early MMC needs to be assessed with longitudinal follow-up studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["#uroonc", "#utuc", "mitomycin-C", "radical nephroureterectomy", "robot-assisted", "robotic nephroureterectomy", "upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089093340", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"57218401782": {"Name": "Gulamhusein A.", "AuthorID": "57218401782", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Specialist Centre for Kidney Cancer, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57218399566": {"Name": "Silva P.", "AuthorID": "57218399566", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Specialist Centre for Kidney Cancer, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57206192754": {"Name": "Cullen D.", "AuthorID": "57206192754", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Specialist Centre for Kidney Cancer, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57216523282": {"Name": "Tran M.", "AuthorID": "57216523282", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Specialist Centre for Kidney Cancer, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004238749": {"Name": "Mumtaz F.", "AuthorID": "7004238749", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Specialist Centre for Kidney Cancer, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57212771665": {"Name": "Patki P.", "AuthorID": "57212771665", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Specialist Centre for Kidney Cancer, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "26430478700": {"Name": "Barod R.", "AuthorID": "26430478700", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Specialist Centre for Kidney Cancer, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004237921": {"Name": "Bex A.", "AuthorID": "7004237921", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Specialist Centre for Kidney Cancer, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
