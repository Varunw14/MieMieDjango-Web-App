To allow the user to type his or her arguments, as opposed to selecting them from a menu, the chatbot needs a sufficiently large knowledge base of arguments and counterarguments. And in order to make the user change their current stance on a subject, the chatbot needs a method to select persuasive counterarguments. To address this, we present a chatbot that is equipped with an argument graph and the ability to identify the concerns of the user argument in order to select appropriate counterarguments. We evaluate the bot in a study with participants and show how using our method can make the chatbot more persuasive.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Argument graphs", "Argumentative persuasion systems", "Chatbots", "Computational persuasion", "Concerns", "Natural language argumentation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chatbot", "Chatbots", "Human agent", "Knowledge base", "Versatile tools"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092365334", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"57194688681": {"Name": "Chalaguine L.A.", "AuthorID": "57194688681", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7402779550": {"Name": "Hunter A.", "AuthorID": "7402779550", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
