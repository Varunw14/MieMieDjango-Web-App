Therefore, older adults are currently living longer with chronic diseases, increased infections, and cancer. A characteristic of aging is the presence of chronic low-grade inflammation that is characterized by elevated concentrations of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and C-reactive protein, which has been termed inflammaging. Previous studies have demonstrated that chronic inflammation interferes with T-cell response and macrophage function and is also detrimental for vaccine responses. This raises the question of whether therapeutic strategies that reduce inflammation may be useful for improving immunity in older adults. In this review we discuss the potential causes of inflammaging, the cellular source of the inflammatory mediators, and the mechanisms by which inflammation may inhibit immunity. Finally, we describe existing interventions that target inflammation that have been used to enhance immunity during aging.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Inflammaging", "p38-MAP Kinase", "senescence", "senolytics"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083670100", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"36625044000": {"Name": "Chambers E.S.", "AuthorID": "36625044000", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Immunobiology, Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7006856048": {"Name": "Akbar A.N.", "AuthorID": "7006856048", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}}}
