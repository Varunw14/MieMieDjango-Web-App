This work reports a molecular simulation study of CH4 and CO2 storage behaviors in kerogen nanopores partially saturated with brine. Molecular distributions of pure CH4, pure CO2 and their mixtures in the kerogen nanopores are quantified and divided into three distinct zones: adsorption between kerogen surfaces in Zone 1, aggregation at the kerogen-brine (water) interface in Zone 2, and gas dissolved in the confined brine in Zone 3. The gas uptake is found to be affected by two different storage mechanisms: adsorption (i.e. in Zone 1) and dissolution (i.e. in Zones 2 and 3). Uptake of CH4 and CO2 decreases linearly with increasing salinity, but with different mechanisms. CH4 uptake is dominated by its adsorption in Zone 1, where its density distribution is not affected, but the available volume decreases as salinity increases. On the other hand, CO2 solubility in brine contributed by Zone 2 and Zone 3 can be comparable to its adsorption in Zone 1. As salinity increases, a significant decrease in CO2 solubility in brine is observed, besides the available volume reduction in Zone 1. For mixture sorption, the CO2 density is enhanced in the region of CH4/CO2/brine (water) interface, while that of CH4 is slightly decreased. Furthermore, increasing salinity leads to decreased amounts of recovered CH4 and sequestrated CO2. Our work provides new and important insights into enhanced gas recovery by CO2 injection and geological CO2 sequestration in shale reservoirs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adsorption", "CO2 sequestration", "Dissolution", "Enhanced gas recovery", "Molecular simulation", "Salinity"], "IndexKeywords": ["CO2 sequestration", "Density distributions", "Different mechanisms", "Enhanced gas recoveries", "Molecular distribution", "Molecular simulations", "Partially saturated", "Storage characteristic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086155913", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"57205766839": {"Name": "Zhou J.", "AuthorID": "57205766839", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60123068", "AffiliationName": "Center for Combustion Energy, Key Laboratory for Thermal Science and Power Engineering of Ministry of Education, Department of Energy and Power Engineering, Tsinghua University"}, "55908979600": {"Name": "Jin Z.", "AuthorID": "55908979600", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "School of Mining and Petroleum Engineering, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Alberta"}, "7102436109": {"Name": "Luo K.H.", "AuthorID": "7102436109", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
