Two distinct oxidation modes determined by the competition between the oxide shell melting and core reaction have been identified. One is the fast oxidation mode with a high reaction heat release rate, where core Al and ambient O atoms diffuse into each other to form a homogeneous alumina particle. The other is the moderate oxidation with lower heat release, where only core Al atoms diffuse into the oxide shell to form a hollow spherical structure. By modeling the shell melting and Al core reaction, a size-derived oxidation model has been proposed to conveniently but accurately predict the ANP reaction dynamics. This work also provides fundamental insight into the synthesis of ANPs that serve as a high energy density fuel and high-performance catalyst.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alumina particles", "Aluminum nanoparticles", "High energy density fuels", "Oxygen atmosphere", "Reaction dynamics", "Reaction mechanism", "Reactive molecular dynamics", "Spherical structures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092612550", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"57192696473": {"Name": "Chu Q.", "AuthorID": "57192696473", "AffiliationID": "60016835", "AffiliationName": "School of Aerospace Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology"}, "55548253900": {"Name": "Shi B.", "AuthorID": "55548253900", "AffiliationID": "60016835", "AffiliationName": "School of Aerospace Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology"}, "57219418658": {"Name": "Zhou Y.", "AuthorID": "57219418658", "AffiliationID": "60016835", "AffiliationName": "School of Aerospace Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology"}, "7404341137": {"Name": "Wang N.", "AuthorID": "7404341137", "AffiliationID": "60016835", "AffiliationName": "School of Aerospace Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology"}, "23766751000": {"Name": "Liao L.", "AuthorID": "23766751000", "AffiliationID": "60019499, 60011040", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "7102436109": {"Name": "Luo K.H.", "AuthorID": "7102436109", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
