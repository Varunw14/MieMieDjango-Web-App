Methods Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates from patients attending sexual health clinics at Barts Health NHS Trust, London, UK, during an 11-month period underwent whole-genome sequencing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. We combined laboratory and patient data to investigate the transmission network structure. Results One hundred and fifty-eight isolates from 158 patients were available with associated descriptive data. One hundred and twenty-nine (82%) patients identified as male and 25 (16%) as female; four (3%) records lacked gender information. Self-described ethnicities were: 51 (32%) English/Welsh/Scottish; 33 (21%) white, other; 23 (15%) black British/black African/black, other; 12 (8%) Caribbean; 9 (6%) South Asian; 6 (4%) mixed ethnicity; and 10 (6%) other; data were missing for 14 (9%). Self-reported sexual orientations were 82 (52%) men who have sex with men (MSM); 49 (31%) heterosexual; 2 (1%) bisexual; data were missing for 25 individuals. Twenty-two (14%) patients were HIV positive. Whole-genome sequence data were generated for 151 isolates, which linked 75 (50%) patients to at least one other case. Using sequencing data, we found no evidence of transmission networks related to specific ethnic groups (p=0.64) or of HIV serosorting (p=0.35). Of 82 MSM/bisexual patients with sequencing data, 45 (55%) belonged to clusters of \u22652 cases, compared with 16/44 (36%) heterosexuals with sequencing data (p=0.06). Conclusion We demonstrate links between 50% of patients in transmission networks using a relatively small sample in a large cosmopolitan city. We found no evidence of HIV serosorting. Our results do not support assortative selectivity as an explanation for differences in gonorrhoea incidence between ethnic groups.", "AuthorKeywords": ["epidemiology (molecular)", "neisseria gonorrhoeae", "sexual networks"], "IndexKeywords": ["African Continental Ancestry Group", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Asian Continental Ancestry Group", "Ethnic Groups", "European Continental Ancestry Group", "Female", "Gonorrhea", "HIV Infections", "HIV Serosorting", "Humans", "London", "Male", "Microbial Sensitivity Tests", "Molecular Epidemiology", "Neisseria gonorrhoeae", "Retrospective Studies", "Sexual Partners", "State Medicine", "United Kingdom", "Urban Population", "Whole Genome Sequencing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074362988", "SubjectAreas": [["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"18534620100": {"Name": "Dave J.", "AuthorID": "18534620100", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "National Infection Service, Public Health Laboratory London, Public Health England"}, "57202518831": {"Name": "Paul J.", "AuthorID": "57202518831", "AffiliationID": "60012806", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Royal Sussex County Hospital"}, "57195075315": {"Name": "Pasvol T.J.", "AuthorID": "57195075315", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Ambrose King Centre, Royal London Hospital"}, "57202863725": {"Name": "Williams A.", "AuthorID": "57202863725", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Ambrose King Centre, Royal London Hospital"}, "7003542687": {"Name": "Warburton F.", "AuthorID": "7003542687", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Statistics Modelling and Economics Department, Public Health England"}, "56041650600": {"Name": "Cole K.", "AuthorID": "56041650600", "AffiliationID": "60012806, 60111140", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Public Health England Collaborative Centre, Royal Sussex County Hospital"}, "56082831900": {"Name": "Miari V.F.", "AuthorID": "56082831900", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7003483431": {"Name": "Stabler R.", "AuthorID": "7003483431", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "36458191600": {"Name": "Eyre D.W.", "AuthorID": "36458191600", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Big Data Institute, University of Oxford"}}}
