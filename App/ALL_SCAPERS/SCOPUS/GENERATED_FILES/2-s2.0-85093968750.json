Indeed, one of the achievements of the elenctic method is to facilitate cognitive self-knowledge. In the Alcibiades, moreover, Plato interprets the Delphic injunction, \u2018know yourself\u2019, as crucially requiring cognitive self-knowledge, and ending in knowing oneself as subject to particular epistemic norms. Epistemic authority for self-knowledge is, for Plato, conferred on the basis of correct application of norms to cognitive self-ascriptions, and not confined to the first-personal perspective. This implies first-personal plural epistemic authority for self-knowledge.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alcibiades", "Apology \u2013Laches", "Dialogue", "Elenchus", "Epistemic authority", "Gorgias", "Self-knowledge"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85093968750", "SubjectAreas": [["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"], ["History and Philosophy of Science", "ARTS", "1207"]], "AuthorData": {"23479991800": {"Name": "Leigh F.", "AuthorID": "23479991800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College"}}}
