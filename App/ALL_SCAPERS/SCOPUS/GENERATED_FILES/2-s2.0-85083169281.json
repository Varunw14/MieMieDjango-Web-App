No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ.This report highlights the importance of tailored treatment strategies in severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) flares driving the life-threatening condition, macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). We report the case of a 42-year-old woman with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who was diagnosed with MAS within 3 days of onset of lethargy, rash, joint pain and significant cytopenias. This early diagnosis meant that her condition was managed with less intensive immunosuppression with only modest doses of steroids and mycophenolate mofetil.", "AuthorKeywords": ["connective tissue disease", "haematology (incl blood transfusion)", "rheumatology", "systemic lupus erythematosus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Drug Therapy, Combination", "Enzyme Inhibitors", "Female", "Glucocorticoids", "Humans", "Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic", "Macrophage Activation Syndrome", "Mycophenolic Acid", "Prednisolone"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083169281", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57216358334": {"Name": "Shah K.", "AuthorID": "57216358334", "AffiliationID": "60032993", "AffiliationName": "Rheumatology Department, West Middlesex University Hospital NHS Trust"}, "57216346144": {"Name": "Porter A.", "AuthorID": "57216346144", "AffiliationID": "60032993", "AffiliationName": "Rheumatology Department, West Middlesex University Hospital NHS Trust"}, "57216343417": {"Name": "Takhar G.", "AuthorID": "57216343417", "AffiliationID": "60032993", "AffiliationName": "Rheumatology Department, West Middlesex University Hospital NHS Trust"}, "57200951428": {"Name": "Reddy V.", "AuthorID": "57200951428", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology, University College London"}}}
