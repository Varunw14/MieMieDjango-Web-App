This flexibility does however come at a cost; MRI images acquired at different sites and with different parameters exhibit significant differences in contrast and tissue appearance, resulting in downstream issues when quantifying brain anatomy or the presence of pathology. In this work, we propose to combine multiparametric MRI-based static-equation sequence simulations with segmentation convolutional neural networks (CNN), to make these networks robust to variations in acquisition parameters. Results demonstrate that, when given both the image and their associated physics acquisition parameters, CNNs can produce segmentations that exhibit robustness to acquisition variations. We also show that the proposed physics-informed methods can be used to bridge multi-centre and longitudinal imaging studies where imaging acquisition varies across a site or in time.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deep learning", "Harmonization", "MRI"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acquisition parameters", "Brain anatomy", "Brain MRI", "Convolutional neural network", "Harmonization", "Imaging modality", "Longitudinal imaging", "Static equations"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075647010", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57204019188": {"Name": "Borges P.", "AuthorID": "57204019188", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, KCL"}, "56198868700": {"Name": "Sudre C.", "AuthorID": "56198868700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL"}, "57200981915": {"Name": "Varsavsky T.", "AuthorID": "57200981915", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, KCL"}, "6506426107": {"Name": "Drobnjak I.", "AuthorID": "6506426107", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, UCL"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, KCL"}, "57204636980": {"Name": "Cardoso M.", "AuthorID": "57204636980", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, KCL"}, "55485914900": {"Name": "Thomas D.", "AuthorID": "55485914900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL"}}}
