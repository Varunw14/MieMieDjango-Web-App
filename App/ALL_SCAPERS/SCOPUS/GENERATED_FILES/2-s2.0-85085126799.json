This study uses EHR texts to detect patients\u2019 disease history from clinical sentences. However, in EHRs, sentences are less topic-focused and shorter than that in general domain, which leads to the sparsity of co-occurrence patterns and the lack of semantic features. To tackle this challenge, current approaches for clinical sentence classification are dependent on external information to improve classification performance. However, this is implausible owing to a lack of universal medical dictionaries. This study proposes the ETM (enrichment by topic modeling) algorithm, based on latent Dirichlet allocation, to smoothen the semantic representations of short sentences. The ETM enriches text representation by incorporating probability distributions generated by an unsupervised algorithm into it. It considers the length of the original texts to enhance representation by using an internal knowledge acquisition procedure. When it comes to clinical predictive modeling, interpretability improves the acceptance of the model. Thus, for clinical sentence classification, the ETM approach employs an initial TFiDF (term frequency inverse document frequency) representation, where we use the support vector machine and neural network algorithms for the classification task. We conducted three sets of experiments on a data set consisting of clinical cardiovascular notes from the Netherlands to test the sentence classification performance of the proposed method in comparison with prevalent approaches. The results show that the proposed ETM approach outperformed state-of-the-art baselines.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clinical sentence classification", "Enriched text representation", "Latent Dirichlet allocation", "Sentence classification", "Short text classification"], "IndexKeywords": ["Classification performance", "Electronic health record (EHRs)", "Latent Dirichlet allocation", "Neural network algorithm", "Semantic representation", "Sentence classifications", "Term frequency-inverse document frequencies", "Unsupervised algorithms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085126799", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"26431285300": {"Name": "Bagheri A.", "AuthorID": "26431285300", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Division of Heart and Lungs, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "7004309875": {"Name": "van der Heijden P.G.M.", "AuthorID": "7004309875", "AffiliationID": "60025225, 60176936", "AffiliationName": "S3RI, Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Southampton"}, "37117700800": {"Name": "Oberski D.L.", "AuthorID": "37117700800", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "56532541800": {"Name": "Sammani A.", "AuthorID": "56532541800", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Division of Heart and Lungs, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "57202567488": {"Name": "Asselbergs F.W.", "AuthorID": "57202567488", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Data Research UK, Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}}}
