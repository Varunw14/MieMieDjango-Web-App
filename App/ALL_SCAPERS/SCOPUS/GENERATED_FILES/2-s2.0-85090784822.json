The aim of this study was to verify the association between the body adiposity index (BAI) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) methods for analyzing body composition, as well as analyzing the validity of BAI to verify the percentage of fat in children and adolescents. Methods: The sample was composed of 106 children and adolescents, 44 females (age: 11.5 \u00b1 1.8 years) and 62 evils (13.6 \u00b1 2.6 years). The body fat (%F) was measured using DXA and the doubly indirect BAI body fat estimation technique. Results: The BAI and DXA estimates of %F were strongly correlated (boys: r =.71, P <.0001; girls: r =.72, P <.0001). The linear regression analyses showed that BAI is significant to estimate the %F in total sample (P <.0001). For boys, the %F analyzes performed by BAI and DXA did not show any differences when compared (P =.2). In addition, BAI pointed out a significant proportion bias for both sexes (P <.0001), which suggests its inefficiency in the analysis of %F. Conclusions: BAI and DXA correlate; however, there is low reliability and a high proportion bias for the analysis of %F by BAI.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090784822", "SubjectAreas": [["Anatomy", "MEDI", "2702"], ["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"57218923006": {"Name": "de Mac\u00eado Ces\u00e1rio T.", "AuthorID": "57218923006", "AffiliationID": "60023857", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physical Education, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, UFRN"}, "57216741011": {"Name": "de Almeida-Neto P.F.", "AuthorID": "57216741011", "AffiliationID": "60023857", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physical Education, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, UFRN"}, "57193927098": {"Name": "de Ara\u00fajo Tin\u00f4co Cabral B.G.", "AuthorID": "57193927098", "AffiliationID": "60023857", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physical Education, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, UFRN"}, "36983733100": {"Name": "de Matos D.G.", "AuthorID": "36983733100", "AffiliationID": "60003079", "AffiliationName": "Group of Studies and Research of Performance, Sport, Health and Paralympic Sports \u2013 GEPEPS, Federal University of Sergipe \u2013 UFS"}, "23093142300": {"Name": "Aidar F.J.", "AuthorID": "23093142300", "AffiliationID": "60003079", "AffiliationName": "Program of Physiological Science, Federal University of Sergipe \u2013 UFS"}, "55603815000": {"Name": "Wells J.", "AuthorID": "55603815000", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Childhood Nutrition Research Centre, Population, Policy and Practice Programme, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}}}
