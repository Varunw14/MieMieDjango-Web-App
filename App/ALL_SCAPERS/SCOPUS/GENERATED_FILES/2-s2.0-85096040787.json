All rights reserved.Digital technology has provided users with new connections that have reset our understanding of social architectures. As a reaction to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data, the educational field has rearranged its structure to consider human and non-human stakeholders and their actions on digital platforms. In light of this increasingly complex scenario, this proposal aims to present definitions and discussions about AI and Big Data from the academic field or published by international organizations. The study of AI and Big Data goes beyond the search for mere computational power and instead focuses upon less difficult (yet perhaps more complex) areas of the study social impacts in Education. This research suggests an analysis of education through 21st century skills and the impact of AI development in the age of platforms, undergoing three methodological considerations: research, application and evaluation. To accomplish the research, we relied upon systematic reviews, bibliographic research and quality analyses conducted within case studies to compose a position paper that sheds light on how AI and Big Data work and on what level they can be applied in the field of education. Our goal is to offer a triangular analysis under a multimodal approach to better understand the interface between education and new technological prospects, taking into consideration qualitative and quantitative procedures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Artificial intelligence", "big data", "digital connection", "digital technology", "education", "mixed methods", "multimodality", "platform society"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096040787", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"57127265600": {"Name": "Bonami B.", "AuthorID": "57127265600", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Investigadora Predoctoral, Universidad de S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "57220063489": {"Name": "Piazentini L.", "AuthorID": "57220063489", "AffiliationID": "125429127", "AffiliationName": "Investigador Predoctoral, Colegio Universitario de Londres"}, "57220061923": {"Name": "Dala-Possa A.", "AuthorID": "57220061923", "AffiliationID": "125429500", "AffiliationName": "Profesor, Instituto Federal de Santa Catarina"}}}
