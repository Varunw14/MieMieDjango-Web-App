Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.Extreme citizen science is a bottom up practice used to empower people by supporting them, via processes and technological tools, to find solutions for local problems, but also to tackle major sustainability challenges of the 21st century. Methods and tools based on mobile computing have been utilized by communities in various parts of the world, from the Congo Basin through the Amazonian rain forest. However, extreme citizen science initiatives often face severe challenges as pre-designed technological solutions prove to be non-transferable to peculiar environments of rural developing regions. In this paper we collect and investigate evidence from the implementation of various extreme citizen science initiatives in the developing world. Our aim is to identify key obstacles towards their successful realization, mainly focusing on the problem of user interaction with mobile computing solutions. We conduct interviews with nine experienced researchers who all performed extensive fieldwork within these initiatives, and who reflect on the technology interaction, knowledge organization, inter-cultural, social and usability issues. Based on our analysis we report among others, symptomatic difficulties with abstractions, representational hierarchies, and navigation commands, as well as potential improvements that mobile technology developers can implement in order to create a more inclusive environment for extreme citizen science.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Developing regions", "Interaction design", "Knowledge organization", "Mobile computing solutions", "Mobile Technology", "Navigation commands", "Technological solution", "Technological tools"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077294840", "SubjectAreas": [["Human Factors and Ergonomics", "SOCI", "3307"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"36634740500": {"Name": "Pejovic V.", "AuthorID": "36634740500", "AffiliationID": "60031106", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Computer and Information Science, University of Ljubljana"}, "54966709700": {"Name": "Skarlatidou A.", "AuthorID": "54966709700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}}}
