Plasticisers may migrate to the plastic\u2019s surface and remain as a deposit, or volatilise into the surrounding environment, both presenting an aesthetic issue and impacting the future stability of the plastic. This paper draws on the work of conservation science, materials degradation, and indoor air quality/emissions studies, to review our current understanding of plasticiser loss. The influence of the material\u2019s intrinsic properties, and environmental factors on migration rates are discussed and related to preventive conservation practices. The methods by which plasticiser migration is studied, including characterisation, are also reviewed, with a particular focus on minimally invasive and non-destructive methods suitable for heritage science research.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Analytical methods", "Migration", "Phthalates", "Plastic degradation", "Plasticiser loss"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096930866", "SubjectAreas": [["Conservation", "ARTS", "1206"], ["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"57219991423": {"Name": "King R.", "AuthorID": "57219991423", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage"}, "56045992600": {"Name": "Grau-Bov\u00e9 J.", "AuthorID": "56045992600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage"}, "22952969300": {"Name": "Curran K.", "AuthorID": "22952969300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage"}}}
