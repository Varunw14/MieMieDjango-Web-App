These properties, along with the high spatial resolution and high efficiency, due to the CdTe sensor material, can be exploited for several imaging applications, such as X-ray phase contrast imaging (XPCI).XPCI relies on the phase shift suffered by X-rays when traversing the sample. This study focuses on the free-space propagation XPCI and single mask edge illumination XPCI methods, which are two approaches that are well suited for laboratory implementations.Since both techniques are highly sensitive to charge-sharing, the Timepix3 energy and time information for each photon are used to minimize this effect by using pixel clustering methods. In addition, the performance of both XPCI techniques across a 30kVp source spectrum is studied using the energy-resolving capabilities of the detector. In both cases, the phase contrast and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are assessed as a function of different energy. Finally, it is demonstrated that phase contrast enhancement is feasible with pixel clustering and energy-selection for both XPCI techniques.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Energy sensitive", "Free space propagation", "High spatial resolution", "Imaging applications", "Phase contrast enhancement", "Sensor materials", "Time information", "X-ray phase-contrast imaging"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083550299", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"]], "AuthorData": {"57216460183": {"Name": "Navarrete C.", "AuthorID": "57216460183", "AffiliationID": "60052106", "AffiliationName": "Universidad de Los Andes, Physics Department"}, "57199848680": {"Name": "Roque G.", "AuthorID": "57199848680", "AffiliationID": "60052106", "AffiliationName": "Universidad de Los Andes, Physics Department"}, "57217356747": {"Name": "Avila C.", "AuthorID": "57217356747", "AffiliationID": "60052106", "AffiliationName": "Universidad de Los Andes, Physics Department"}, "57210438560": {"Name": "Schuetz M.", "AuthorID": "57210438560", "AffiliationID": "60052106", "AffiliationName": "Universidad de Los Andes, Physics Department"}, "56889294000": {"Name": "Fiederle M.", "AuthorID": "56889294000", "AffiliationID": "60052106", "AffiliationName": "Universidad de Los Andes, Physics Department"}, "24071649600": {"Name": "Procz S.", "AuthorID": "24071649600", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Freiburg Materials Research Center (FMF)"}, "57211312151": {"Name": "Fey J.", "AuthorID": "57211312151", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Freiburg Materials Research Center (FMF)"}, "7004072469": {"Name": "Olivo A.", "AuthorID": "7004072469", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering"}}}
