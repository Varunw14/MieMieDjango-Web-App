Molecular Genetics & Genomic Medicine published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Background: Mutations in the GBA gene that encodes the lysosomal enzyme acid \u03b2-glucocerebrosidase cause Gaucher disease (GD), the most common lysosomal storage disorder. Most of the mutations are missense/nonsense, however, a few splicing mutations within or close to conserved consensus donor or acceptor splice sites have also been described. The aim of the study was to identify the mutation(s) in a Cypriot patient with type I GD. Methods: The genomic DNA of the proband was screened for nine common mutations using Polymerase chain reaction\u2013restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR\u2013RFLP) analysis. All exons and exon-intron boundaries, and the 5\u2019UTR and 3\u2019UTR regions of the GBA gene, were investigated by Sanger sequencing. RNA analysis was performed using standard procedures, and the abnormal transcript was further cloned into pGEM-T-Easy plasmid vector and sequenced. The relevant intronic region was further sequenced by the Sanger method to identify the genetic variant. Results: A novel point mutation, g.12599C > A (c.999 + 242C > A), was detected deep in intron 7 of the GBA gene. This type of mutation has been previously described for other diseases but this is the first time, as far as we know, that it is described for GD. This mutation creates a new donor splice site leading to aberrant splicing and resulting in the insertion of the first 239nt of intron 7 as a pseudoexon in the mRNA, creating a premature stop codon. Conclusion: This study expands the mutation spectrum of GD and highlights the importance of RNA sequencing for the molecular diagnosis of patients bearing mutations in nonexonic regions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cypriot", "deep intronic mutation", "Gaucher disease", "GBA", "glucocerebrosidase"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078072622", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"9237435700": {"Name": "Malekkou A.", "AuthorID": "9237435700", "AffiliationID": "114671531", "AffiliationName": "Cyprus School of Molecular Medicine"}, "57220253715": {"Name": "Sevastou I.", "AuthorID": "57220253715", "AffiliationID": "60115564", "AffiliationName": "Reta Lila Weston Institute & Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "56191924900": {"Name": "Mavrikiou G.", "AuthorID": "56191924900", "AffiliationID": "60071321", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Genetics, The Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics"}, "8450959200": {"Name": "Georgiou T.", "AuthorID": "8450959200", "AffiliationID": "114671531", "AffiliationName": "Cyprus School of Molecular Medicine"}, "6602376291": {"Name": "Drousiotou A.", "AuthorID": "6602376291", "AffiliationID": "114671531", "AffiliationName": "Cyprus School of Molecular Medicine"}, "35557417200": {"Name": "Vilageliu L.", "AuthorID": "35557417200", "AffiliationID": "60001576, 60085100", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Faculty of Biology, Universitat de Barcelona, IBUB, CIBERER"}, "6603497576": {"Name": "Moraitou M.", "AuthorID": "6603497576", "AffiliationID": "106536603", "AffiliationName": "Department of Enzymology and Cellular Function, Institute of Child Health"}, "7003963499": {"Name": "Michelakakis H.", "AuthorID": "7003963499", "AffiliationID": "106536603", "AffiliationName": "Department of Enzymology and Cellular Function, Institute of Child Health"}, "55035749700": {"Name": "Prokopiou C.", "AuthorID": "55035749700", "AffiliationID": "60071332", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Limassol General Hospital"}}}
