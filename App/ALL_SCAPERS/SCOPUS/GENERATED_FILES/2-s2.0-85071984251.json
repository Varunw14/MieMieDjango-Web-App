Differences between light-chain (AL) and transthyretin (ATTR) cardiac amyloidosis may have prognostic implications. Methods and Results ECG imaging and cardiac magnetic resonance studies were conducted in 21 cardiac amyloidosis patients (11 AL and 10 ATTR). Healthy volunteers were included as controls. With respect to ATTR, AL patients had lower amyloid volume (51.0/37.7 versus 73.7/16.4 mL, P=0.04), lower myocardial cell volume (42.6/19.1 versus 58.5/17.2 mL, P=0.021), and higher T1 (1172/64 versus 1109/80 ms, P=0.022) and T2 (53.4/2.9 versus 50.0/3.1 ms, P=0.003). ECG imaging revealed differences between cardiac amyloidosis and control patients in virtually all conduction-repolarization parameters. With respect to ATTR, AL patients had lower epicardial signal amplitude (1.07/0.46 versus 1.83/1.26 mV, P=0.026), greater epicardial signal fractionation (P=0.019), and slightly higher dispersion of repolarization (187.6/65 versus 158.3/40 ms, P=0.062). No significant difference between AL and ATTR patients was found using the standard 12-lead ECG. T1 correlated with epicardial signal amplitude (cc=-0.78), and extracellular volume with epicardial signal fractionation (cc=0.48) and repolarization time (cc=0.43). Univariate models based on single features from both cardiac magnetic resonance and ECG imaging classified AL and ATTR patients with an accuracy of 70% to 80%. Conclusions In this exploratory study cardiac amyloidosis was associated with ventricular conduction and repolarization abnormalities, which were more pronounced in AL than in ATTR. Combined ECG imaging-cardiac magnetic resonance analysis supports the hypothesis that additional mechanisms beyond infiltration may contribute to myocardial damage in AL amyloidosis. Further studies are needed to assess the clinical impact of this approach.", "AuthorKeywords": ["amyloid", "arrhythmia", "electrophysiology mapping", "imaging", "T1 mapping"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Amyloid Neuropathies, Familial", "Amyloidosis", "Cardiac Imaging Techniques", "Cardiomyopathies", "Case-Control Studies", "Electrocardiography", "Female", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin Light-chain Amyloidosis", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pericardium"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071984251", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"26321773400": {"Name": "Orini M.", "AuthorID": "26321773400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science University College London London United Kingdom"}, "57196246415": {"Name": "Graham A.J.", "AuthorID": "57196246415", "AffiliationID": "60159931, 60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre Barts Health NHS Trust London United Kingdom"}, "6603130488": {"Name": "Lambiase P.D.", "AuthorID": "6603130488", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science University College London London United Kingdom"}, "55343433500": {"Name": "Martinez-Naharro A.", "AuthorID": "55343433500", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free Hospital UCL Hospitals Trust London United Kingdom"}, "35464959200": {"Name": "Hawkins P.N.", "AuthorID": "35464959200", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free Hospital UCL Hospitals Trust London United Kingdom"}, "16306839900": {"Name": "Fontana M.", "AuthorID": "16306839900", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free Hospital UCL Hospitals Trust London United Kingdom"}, "7201809127": {"Name": "Andrews C.M.", "AuthorID": "7201809127", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Cardiac Bioelectricity and Arrhythmia Center Washington University in St Louis St. Louis MO"}, "7006357635": {"Name": "Rudy Y.", "AuthorID": "7006357635", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Cardiac Bioelectricity and Arrhythmia Center Washington University in St Louis St. Louis MO"}, "57190859080": {"Name": "de Marvao A.", "AuthorID": "57190859080", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences Imperial College London London United Kingdom"}, "56576436700": {"Name": "Statton B.", "AuthorID": "56576436700", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences Imperial College London London United Kingdom"}, "57209237648": {"Name": "Cook S.A.", "AuthorID": "57209237648", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences Imperial College London London United Kingdom"}, "8874856800": {"Name": "O'Regan D.P.", "AuthorID": "8874856800", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences Imperial College London London United Kingdom"}}}
