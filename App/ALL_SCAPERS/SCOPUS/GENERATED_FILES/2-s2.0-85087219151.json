Clinical Case Reports published by John Wiley & Sons LtdA 46-year-old male had 11-year history of cryptic autonomic dysfunction. He developed a fatal autonomic failure with diffuse hypoxic brain injury. Histology examination of medulla oblongata and the celiac ganglion revealed many \u03b1-synuclein immunoreactive Lewy bodies confirming the diagnosis of premanifesting Parkinson's disease (PD). PNS involvement in PD is underappreciated.", "AuthorKeywords": ["autonomic dysfunction", "Lewy body disease", "multiple system atrophy", "neurodegeneration", "Parkinson's disease", "\u03b1-synuclein"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087219151", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55367947400": {"Name": "Bodi I.", "AuthorID": "55367947400", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neuropathology, King's College Hospital, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7102650186": {"Name": "Hagen E.M.", "AuthorID": "7102650186", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Autonomic Unit, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57217561082": {"Name": "Ingle G.T.", "AuthorID": "57217561082", "AffiliationID": "60020849", "AffiliationName": "Neurology Department, Whipps Cross University Hospital"}, "7004224851": {"Name": "Lunn M.P.", "AuthorID": "7004224851", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuromuscular Disease, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
