Published by BMJ on behalf of the European Society for Medical Oncology.The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and its related disease (COVID-19) has required an immediate and coordinate healthcare response to face the worldwide emergency and define strategies to maintain the continuum of care for the non-COVID-19 diseases while protecting patients and healthcare providers. The dimension of the COVID-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented risk especially for the more vulnerable populations. To manage patients with cancer adequately, maintaining the highest quality of care, a definition of value-based priorities is necessary to define which interventions can be safely postponed without affecting patients' outcome. The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) has endorsed a tiered approach across three different levels of priority (high, medium, low) incorporating information on the value-based prioritisation and clinical cogency of the interventions that can be applied for different disease sites. Patients with gynaecological cancer are at particular risk of COVID-19 complications because of their age and prevalence of comorbidities. The definition of priority level should be based on tumour stage and histology, cancer-related symptoms or complications, aim (curative vs palliative) and magnitude of benefit of the oncological intervention, patients' general condition and preferences. The decision-making process always needs to consider the disease-specific national and international guidelines and the local healthcare system and social resources, and a changing situation in relation to COVID-19 infection. These recommendations aim to provide guidance for the definition of deferrable and undeferrable interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic for ovarian, endometrial and cervical cancers within the context of the ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cervical cancer", "COVID-19", "endometrial cancer", "ovarian cancer", "value-based priorities"], "IndexKeywords": ["Betacoronavirus", "Comorbidity", "Coronavirus Infections", "Delivery of Health Care", "Endometrial Neoplasms", "Europe", "Female", "Genital Neoplasms, Female", "Humans", "Medical Oncology", "Ovarian Neoplasms", "Pandemics", "Pneumonia, Viral", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Societies, Medical", "Uterine Cervical Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088812298", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"57218323932": {"Name": "Colombo I.", "AuthorID": "57218323932", "AffiliationID": "60033277", "AffiliationName": "Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland"}, "57194051081": {"Name": "Del Grande M.", "AuthorID": "57194051081", "AffiliationID": "60033277", "AffiliationName": "Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland"}, "56250953800": {"Name": "Sessa C.", "AuthorID": "56250953800", "AffiliationID": "60033277", "AffiliationName": "Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland"}, "36952066600": {"Name": "Zaccarelli E.", "AuthorID": "36952066600", "AffiliationID": "60030442", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynecologic Oncology, European Institute of Oncology"}, "57219378882": {"Name": "Tomao F.", "AuthorID": "57219378882", "AffiliationID": "60030442", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynecologic Oncology, European Institute of Oncology"}, "56205229900": {"Name": "Multinu F.", "AuthorID": "56205229900", "AffiliationID": "60030442", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynecologic Oncology, European Institute of Oncology"}, "57208264005": {"Name": "Betella I.", "AuthorID": "57208264005", "AffiliationID": "60030442", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynecologic Oncology, European Institute of Oncology"}, "7005656356": {"Name": "Colombo N.", "AuthorID": "7005656356", "AffiliationID": "60030442", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynecologic Oncology, European Institute of Oncology"}, "7007134127": {"Name": "Ledermann J.A.", "AuthorID": "7007134127", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology and Cancer Trials, Ucl Cancer Institute"}, "22953696600": {"Name": "Gonzalez-Martin A.", "AuthorID": "22953696600", "AffiliationID": "60033320", "AffiliationName": "Medical Oncology Department, Cl\u00ednica Universidad de Navarra"}}}
