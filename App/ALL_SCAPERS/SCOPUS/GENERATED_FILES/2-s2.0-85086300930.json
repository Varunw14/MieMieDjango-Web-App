The reality of UDN is that line-of-sight (LOS) communication becomes more likely to occur but this desirable result also complicates the performance analysis of random UDNs and puts an obstacle on the design and optimization of UDNs. The aim of this paper is to derive analytical results that take into account the phenomenon of having mixed LOS and non line-of-sight (NLOS) links in UDNs. In particular, the use of an arbitrary shaped thinning process to model the LOS wireless links allowed us to investigate a wide set of scenarios for what concerns the desired and interfering power levels. Our contribution is an accurate approximation in closed form for the success content delivery probability (SCDP) that decouples the contribution from LOS and NLOS links. Simulation results corroborate the accuracy of the proposed approximation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Line-of-sight", "stochastic geometry", "success content delivery probability", "ultra dense network"], "IndexKeywords": ["Analytical results", "Communication distance", "Content delivery", "Design and optimization", "Effective solution", "Nonline of sight", "Performance analysis", "Thinning process"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086300930", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"57217114283": {"Name": "Gruppi E.", "AuthorID": "57217114283", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7404759940": {"Name": "Wong K.K.", "AuthorID": "7404759940", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "49863051600": {"Name": "Chin W.H.", "AuthorID": "49863051600", "AffiliationID": "60018735", "AffiliationName": "Toshiba Research Europe Ltd."}}}
