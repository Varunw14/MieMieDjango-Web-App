No clinical blood tests are available for diagnosis or disease monitoring. Here, we profile blood microRNA (miRNA) expression in sCJD. Sequencing of 57 sCJD patients, and healthy controls reveals differential expression of hsa-let-7i-5p, hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-93-5p and hsa-miR-106b-3p. Downregulation of hsa-let-7i-5p, hsa-miR-16-5p and hsa-miR-93-5p replicates in an independent cohort using quantitative PCR, with concomitant upregulation of four mRNA targets. Absence of correlation in cross-sectional analysis with clinical phenotypes parallels the lack of association between rate of decline in miRNA expression, and rate of disease progression in a longitudinal cohort of samples from 21 patients. Finally, the miRNA signature shows a high level of accuracy in discriminating sCJD from Alzheimer\u2019s disease. These findings highlight molecular alterations in the periphery in sCJD which provide information about differential diagnosis and improve mechanistic understanding of human prion diseases.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Biomarkers", "Cohort Studies", "Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "MicroRNAs", "Middle Aged", "Reproducibility of Results", "RNA, Messenger", "ROC Curve"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089189100", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57200605832": {"Name": "Norsworthy P.J.", "AuthorID": "57200605832", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60033212", "AffiliationName": "MRC Prion Unit at UCL, UCL Institute of Prion Diseases"}, "57218442647": {"Name": "Guntoro F.", "AuthorID": "57218442647", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60033212", "AffiliationName": "MRC Prion Unit at UCL, UCL Institute of Prion Diseases"}, "57218438925": {"Name": "Dabin L.C.", "AuthorID": "57218438925", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60033212", "AffiliationName": "MRC Prion Unit at UCL, UCL Institute of Prion Diseases"}, "57203103373": {"Name": "Collinge J.", "AuthorID": "57203103373", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Prion Clinic, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCL Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57203050579": {"Name": "Mead S.", "AuthorID": "57203050579", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Prion Clinic, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCL Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6507872766": {"Name": "Vir\u00e9 E.A.", "AuthorID": "6507872766", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60033212", "AffiliationName": "MRC Prion Unit at UCL, UCL Institute of Prion Diseases"}, "57208196393": {"Name": "Thompson A.G.B.", "AuthorID": "57208196393", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Prion Clinic, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCL Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57188854226": {"Name": "Mok T.H.", "AuthorID": "57188854226", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Prion Clinic, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCL Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "28767867200": {"Name": "Nihat A.", "AuthorID": "28767867200", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Prion Clinic, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCL Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55799312800": {"Name": "Paterson R.W.", "AuthorID": "55799312800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London, Queen Square"}, "57213315348": {"Name": "Schott J.M.", "AuthorID": "57213315348", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London, Queen Square"}}}
