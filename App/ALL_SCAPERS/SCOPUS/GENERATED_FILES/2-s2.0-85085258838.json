At each step of the iteration, the method randomly chooses one equation from the nonlinear system to obtain an unbiased stochastic estimate of the gradient and then performs a descent step with the estimated gradient. It is a randomized version of the classical Landweber method for nonlinear inverse problems, and it is highly scalable to the problem size and holds significant potential for solving large-scale inverse problems. Under the canonical tangential cone condition, we prove the regularizing property for a priori stopping rules and then establish the convergence rates under a suitable sourcewise condition and a range invariance condition.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Convergence rates", "Nonlinear inverse problems", "Regularizing property", "Stochastic gradient descent"], "IndexKeywords": ["Convergence rates", "ILL-posed inverse problem", "Invariance condition", "Landweber methods", "Non-linear inverse problem", "Nonlinear ill-posed problems", "Numerical solution", "Stochastic gradient descent"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085258838", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"]], "AuthorData": {"8268296700": {"Name": "Jin B.", "AuthorID": "8268296700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "57216909374": {"Name": "Zhou Z.", "AuthorID": "57216909374", "AffiliationID": "60002798", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Chinese University of Hong Kong"}, "8389644300": {"Name": "Zou J.", "AuthorID": "8389644300", "AffiliationID": "60002798", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Chinese University of Hong Kong"}}}
