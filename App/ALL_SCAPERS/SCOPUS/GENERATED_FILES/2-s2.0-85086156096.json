Fossil fuel supplies are depleting, and the price of these fuels is increasing. Moreover, there are concerns about related emissions of toxic pollutants such as sulphur dioxide and aromatic hydrocarbons. Here, we review alternative fuel technologies. We focus on how membrane reactors improve the existing production processes of renewable fuels. Advantages and environmental benefits of membrane reactors are compared to the conventional techniques. Membrane reactors have been applied successfully to improve biodiesel, hydrogen and Fischer\u2013Tropsch synthesis. Membranes help the conversion of products, whilst shifting the equilibrium of the reaction and reducing undesired by-products. Membrane reactors also overcome immiscibility issues that hinder conventional reactor processes. Overall, membrane reactors reduce cost and energy needed for the treatment of wastewater from fuel production.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Energy", "Fischer\u2013Tropsch", "Fuel", "Hydrocarbons", "Membrane reactors"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086156096", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"]], "AuthorData": {"57203246837": {"Name": "Hafeez S.", "AuthorID": "57203246837", "AffiliationID": "60031237", "AffiliationName": "Division of Chemical & Petroleum Engineering, School of Engineering, London South Bank University"}, "35558454600": {"Name": "Constantinou A.", "AuthorID": "35558454600", "AffiliationID": "60077474", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Cyprus University of Technology"}, "21741893000": {"Name": "Al-Salem S.M.", "AuthorID": "21741893000", "AffiliationID": "60040278", "AffiliationName": "Environment & Life Sciences Research Centre, Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research"}, "7004913362": {"Name": "Manos G.", "AuthorID": "7004913362", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
