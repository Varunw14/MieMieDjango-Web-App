Patients and Methods: This phase I dose-finding part treated patients ages 1 to <18 years with BRAF V600 mutation\u2013positive tumors with oral dabrafenib 3 to 5.25 mg/kg/day to determine the RP2D based on safety and drug exposure target. Results: Between May 2013 and November 2014, 27 patients [12 male; median age, 9 years (range, 1\u201317 years)] with BRAF V600\u2013mutant solid tumors recurrent/refractory to treatment (low- or high-grade glioma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, neuroblastoma, or thyroid cancer) were enrolled. The median treatment duration was 75.6 weeks (range, 5.6\u2013148.7 weeks), with 63% treated for >52 weeks and 52% undergoing treatment at data cutoff date. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events suspected to be related to study drug were maculopapular rash and arthralgia (2 patients each). No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Pharmacokinetic analyses showed a dose-dependent increase in AUC0\u201312 and achievement of adult exposure levels at the recommended phase II doses of 5.25 mg/kg/day (age <12 years) and 4.5 mg/kg/day (age \u226512 years) divided into 2 equal doses daily, not exceeding 300 mg daily. Conclusions: In this first clinical trial in pediatric patients with pretreated BRAF V600\u2013mutant tumors, dabrafenib was well tolerated while achieving target exposure levels; the average treatment duration was >1 year with many patients still on treatment. The phase II component is also closed and will be reported separately.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076502268", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"7004765744": {"Name": "Kieran M.W.", "AuthorID": "7004765744", "AffiliationID": "60030521, 60002746, 60014334", "AffiliationName": "Harvard Medical School, Boston Children's Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"}, "6603067617": {"Name": "Geoerger B.", "AuthorID": "6603067617", "AffiliationID": "60106017, 60106080", "AffiliationName": "Department of Childhood and Adolescent Oncology, Gustave Roussy Cancer Center, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay"}, "7004912949": {"Name": "Dunkel I.J.", "AuthorID": "7004912949", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"}, "6602821362": {"Name": "Broniscer A.", "AuthorID": "6602821362", "AffiliationID": "60019905", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital"}, "57210349888": {"Name": "Hargrave D.", "AuthorID": "57210349888", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, Pediatric Oncology Unit"}, "24172374300": {"Name": "Hingorani P.", "AuthorID": "24172374300", "AffiliationID": "60007421", "AffiliationName": "Phoenix Children's Hospital, Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders"}, "8100913600": {"Name": "Aerts I.", "AuthorID": "8100913600", "AffiliationID": "60030640, 60108665", "AffiliationName": "Institut Curie, PSL Research University, Oncology Center SIREDO"}, "8688666600": {"Name": "Bertozzi A.I.", "AuthorID": "8688666600", "AffiliationID": "60024960", "AffiliationName": "CHU de Toulouse - P\u00f4le P\u00e9diatrique"}, "7102614779": {"Name": "Cohen K.J.", "AuthorID": "7102614779", "AffiliationID": "60021212, 60005248", "AffiliationName": "Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins"}, "6505846435": {"Name": "Pratilas C.A.", "AuthorID": "6505846435", "AffiliationID": "60021212, 60005248", "AffiliationName": "Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins"}, "36618938200": {"Name": "Hummel T.R.", "AuthorID": "36618938200", "AffiliationID": "60030440", "AffiliationName": "Cancer and Blood Disorder Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center"}, "16140777800": {"Name": "Shen V.", "AuthorID": "16140777800", "AffiliationID": "60006322", "AffiliationName": "Children's Hospital of Orange County"}, "57203082668": {"Name": "Bouffet E.", "AuthorID": "57203082668", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Department of Pediatrics"}, "7102828297": {"Name": "Whitlock J.A.", "AuthorID": "7102828297", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Department of Pediatrics"}, "7401994312": {"Name": "Pearson A.D.J.", "AuthorID": "7401994312", "AffiliationID": "60017166, 60010337", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Drug Development, Children and Young People's Unit, Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "57212371543": {"Name": "Tseng L.", "AuthorID": "57212371543", "AffiliationID": "60009968", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation"}, "36350214600": {"Name": "Nebot N.", "AuthorID": "36350214600", "AffiliationID": "60009968", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation"}, "57200895313": {"Name": "Russo M.W.", "AuthorID": "57200895313", "AffiliationID": "60009968", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation"}, "56589395100": {"Name": "Green S.", "AuthorID": "56589395100", "AffiliationID": "60009968", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Pharma AG"}}}
