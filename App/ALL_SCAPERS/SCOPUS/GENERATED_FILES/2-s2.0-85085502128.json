Subjects/Methods: Twenty-six eyes from 13 male CHM patients were included in this prospective longitudinal study. Participants were divided into <50-year (n = 8) and \u226550-year (n = 5) old groups. Patients were seen at baseline, 6-month, and 1-year visits. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), OCT angiography, and fundus autofluorescence were performed to measure central foveal (CFT) and subfoveal choroidal thickness (SCT), as well as areas of preserved choriocapillaris (CC), ellipsoid zone (EZ), and autofluorescence (PAF). Patients also underwent functional investigations including visual acuity (VA), contrast sensitivity (CS), colour testing, microperimetry, dark adaptometry, and handheld electroretinogram (ERG). Vision-related quality-of-life was assessed by using the NEI-VFQ-25 questionnaire. Results: Over the 1-year follow-up period, progressive loss was detected in SCT, EZ, CC, PAF, and CFT. Those \u226550-years exhibited more structural and functional defects with SCT, EZ, CC, and PAF showing strong correlation with patient age (rho \u2264 \u22120.47, p \u2264 0.02). CS and VA did not change over the year, but CS was significantly correlated with age (rho = \u22120.63, p = 0.001). Delayed to unmeasurable dark adaptation, decreased colour discrimination and no detectable ERG activity were observed in all patients. Minimal functional deterioration was observed over one year with a general trend of slower progression in the \u226550-years group. Conclusions: Quantitative structural parameters including SCT, CC, EZ, and PAF are most useful for disease monitoring in CHM. Extended follow-up studies are required to determine longitudinal functional changes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085502128", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"]], "AuthorData": {"57195265940": {"Name": "Hagag A.M.", "AuthorID": "57195265940", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57209213954": {"Name": "Mitsios A.", "AuthorID": "57209213954", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "43961055700": {"Name": "Abbouda A.", "AuthorID": "43961055700", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57208891770": {"Name": "Webster A.R.", "AuthorID": "57208891770", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "34876470600": {"Name": "Dubis A.M.", "AuthorID": "34876470600", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "6506942455": {"Name": "Moosajee M.", "AuthorID": "6506942455", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57217646498": {"Name": "Narayan A.", "AuthorID": "57217646498", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
