Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of European Academy of Dermatology and VenereologyThis guideline is an update of the 2011 European Guideline for the Management of Anogenital Warts. It is intended to support best practice in the care of patients with anogenital warts by including evidence-based recommendations on diagnosis, treatment, follow-up and advice to patients. It is intended for use by healthcare professionals in sexual healthcare or dermato-venereology clinics in Europe but may be adapted for use in other settings where the management of anogenital warts is undertaken. As a European guideline, recommendations should be adapted according to national circumstances and healthcare systems. Despite the availability of vaccine to prevent HPV types 6 and 11, the cause of >95% anogenital warts, they remain an important and frequent health problem. The previous systematic review of randomized controlled trials for anogenital warts was updated. The changes in the present guideline include the following: Updated background information on the prevalence, natural history and transmission of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and anogenital warts. Key recommendations for diagnosis and treatment have been graded according to the strength of the recommendation and the quality of supporting evidence. 5-fluorouracil, local interferon and photodynamic therapy have been evaluated and included as potential second-line treatment options. Evidence of the impact of HPV vaccination on the incidence of anogenital warts has been updated.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088786834", "SubjectAreas": [["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57215455200": {"Name": "Gilson R.", "AuthorID": "57215455200", "AffiliationID": "60162114, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Mortimer Market Centre, Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56287592500": {"Name": "Nugent D.", "AuthorID": "56287592500", "AffiliationID": "60162114, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Mortimer Market Centre, Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55674790500": {"Name": "Werner R.N.", "AuthorID": "55674790500", "AffiliationID": "60026245, 60000762, 60030718, 60126120", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Allergy, Division of Evidence-Based Medicine (dEBM), Charit\u00e9 \u2013 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin, Berlin Institute of Health"}, "57220466366": {"Name": "Ballesteros J.", "AuthorID": "57220466366", "AffiliationID": "60085110", "AffiliationName": "Centro Sanitario Sandoval"}, "35476403300": {"Name": "Ross J.", "AuthorID": "35476403300", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
