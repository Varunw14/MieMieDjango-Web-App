It has been linked to microcephaly in neonates, and as such, it poses a significant risk to human pregnancy. Zika virus infection is also implicated in other severe neurological disorders such as Guillain-Barre syndrome. There is currently no vaccine available to treat Zika virus disease, and as such, it represents a serious challenge to public health. Antigenic similarities between Zika and dengue can suggest artificially high infection rates of Zika within specific population groups. Here, we review recent literature and provide an update on the status of the Zika outbreak, including a description of available medical countermeasure options and current diagnosis methodology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aedes aegypti", "Dengue", "Flavivirus", "Microcephaly", "Mosquitos", "Zika"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090241914", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"57216039988": {"Name": "Hossein F.", "AuthorID": "57216039988", "AffiliationID": "60020730", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, Nanotechnology and Integrated Bio-Engineering Centre (NIBEC), Ulster University"}}}
