Our scheme is based on adding predictions of multiple \u0394-machine learning models trained on energies and energy corrections calculated with a hierarchy of quantum chemical methods. Our (semi-)automatic procedure determines the optimal training set size and composition of each constituent machine learning model, simultaneously minimizing the computational effort necessary to achieve the required accuracy of the hML PES. Machine learning models are built using kernel ridge regression, and training points are selected with structure-based sampling. As an illustrative example, hML is applied to a high-level ab initio CH3Cl PES and is shown to significantly reduce the computational cost of generating the PES by a factor of 100 while retaining similar levels of accuracy (errors of \u223c1 cm-1).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085908462", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"27267482300": {"Name": "Dral P.O.", "AuthorID": "27267482300", "AffiliationID": "60018205, 60082500", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Theoretical and Computational Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University"}, "56678364300": {"Name": "Owens A.", "AuthorID": "56678364300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57201589416": {"Name": "Dral A.", "AuthorID": "57201589416", "AffiliationID": "124519069", "AffiliationName": "1A Tormoznoye Shosse Off 17"}, "6602577617": {"Name": "Cs\u00e1nyi G.", "AuthorID": "6602577617", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge"}}}
