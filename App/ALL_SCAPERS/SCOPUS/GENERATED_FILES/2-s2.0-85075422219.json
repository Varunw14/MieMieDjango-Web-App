This study demonstrated, for the first time, the ability to successfully pyrolyse olive pomace with microwaves for the production of bio-char and bio-oil. It was found that the energy requirement needed to pyrolyse up to 80% of the olive pomace was as low as 3.6 kJ/g and bio-oil yields up to 30% were produced. Microwave power did not influence the overall yields or the chemical composition of the obtained bio-oils, but did alter the textural properties of the generated bio-chars and their ability to remove methylene blue dye. Optimum processing conditions were found to be within the 3.6 kJ/g energy requirement with a microwave power of 200 W and processing time of 180 sec. These conditions produced a bio-oil fraction containing mainly acetic acid (71.9%) and a bio-char with a surface area of 392.3 m2/g, micropore volume of 0.15 cm3/g and a methylene blue removal efficiency of 40 qMB mg/g. The results acquired from this study reveal the superiority of microwave heating in a pyrolysis system and highlight a novel and prospective route for added value recovery from natural waste resources like olive pomace.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bio-char", "Bio-oil", "Bioenergy", "Microwave pyrolysis", "Olive pomace"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bio chars", "Bio oil", "Bio-energy", "Microwave pyrolysis", "Olive pomace"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075422219", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"56667636500": {"Name": "Kostas E.T.", "AuthorID": "56667636500", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering, the University of Nottingham"}, "7004669230": {"Name": "Lye G.J.", "AuthorID": "7004669230", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, The Advanced Centre of Biochemical Engineering, Bernard Katz Building, University College London"}, "56337960900": {"Name": "Dur\u00e1n-Jim\u00e9nez G.", "AuthorID": "56337960900", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering, the University of Nottingham"}, "57203243111": {"Name": "Shepherd B.J.", "AuthorID": "57203243111", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering, the University of Nottingham"}, "35520187200": {"Name": "Meredith W.", "AuthorID": "35520187200", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering, the University of Nottingham"}, "54390021200": {"Name": "Stevens L.A.", "AuthorID": "54390021200", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering, the University of Nottingham"}, "56119003100": {"Name": "Williams O.S.A.", "AuthorID": "56119003100", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering, the University of Nottingham"}, "55232026700": {"Name": "Robinson J.P.", "AuthorID": "55232026700", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering, the University of Nottingham"}}}
