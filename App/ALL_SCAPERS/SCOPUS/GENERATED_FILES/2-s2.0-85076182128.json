The mapping between real and virtual motion is modified by scaling some aspect of motion. As a user traverses the virtual environment these modifications (or gains) must be dynamically adjusted to prevent collision with physical obstacles. A significant body of work has established perceptual thresholds on rates of absolute gain, but the effect of changing gain is little understood. We present the results of a user study on the effects of rate of gain change. A psychophysical experiment was conducted with 21 participants. Each participant completed a series of two-alternative forced choice tasks in which they determined whether their virtual motion differed from their physical motion while experiencing one of three different methods of gain change: sudden gain change, slow gain change and constant gain. Gain thresholds were determined by 3 interleaved 2-up 1-down staircases, one per condition. Our results indicate that slow gain change is significantly harder to detect than sudden gain change.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Head-mounted display", "Redirected walking", "Virtual reality"], "IndexKeywords": ["Gain thresholds", "Head mounted displays", "Natural locomotions", "Perceptual threshold", "Physical environments", "Psychophysical experiments", "Redirected walkings", "Two-alternative forced choice tasks"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076182128", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"56367335500": {"Name": "Congdon B.J.", "AuthorID": "56367335500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "18435050200": {"Name": "Steed A.", "AuthorID": "18435050200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
