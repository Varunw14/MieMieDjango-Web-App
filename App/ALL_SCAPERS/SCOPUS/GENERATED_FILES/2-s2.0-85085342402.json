Methods: 1545 men undergoing prostate biopsies in a Taiwanese tertiary medical center between 2012 and 2019 were identified retrospectively. A five-fold cross-validated logistic regression risk model was created to calculate the probabilities of PCa and high-grade PCa (Gleason score \u2267 7), to compare those of the Rotterdam and Coral apps. Discrimination was analyzed using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC). Calibration was graphically evaluated with the goodness-of-fit test. Decision-curve analysis was performed for clinical utility. At different risk thresholds to biopsy, the proportion of biopsies saved versus low- and high-grade PCa missed were presented. Results: Overall, 278/1309 (21.2%) patients were diagnosed with PCa, and 181 out of 278 (65.1%) patients had high-grade PCa. Both our model and the Rotterdam app demonstrated better discriminative ability than the Coral app for detection of PCa (AUC: 0.795 vs 0.792 vs 0.697, DeLong\u2019s method: P < 0.001) and high-grade PCa (AUC: 0.869 vs 0.873 vs 0.767, P < 0.001). Using a \u2265 10% risk threshold for high-grade PCa to biopsy, our model could save 67.2% of total biopsies; among these saved biopsies, only 3.4% high-grade PCa would be missed. Conclusion: Our new logistic regression model, similar to the Rotterdam app, outperformed the Coral app in the prediction of PCa and high-grade PCa. Additionally, our model could save unnecessary biopsies and avoid missing clinically significant PCa in the Taiwanese population.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diagnosis", "mHealth", "Mobile apps", "Prostate cancer", "Prostate-specific antigen", "Risk calculator"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085342402", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"56663715000": {"Name": "Chen I.H.A.", "AuthorID": "56663715000", "AffiliationID": "60011828, 60004965", "AffiliationName": "Division of Urology, Department of Surgery, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center"}, "55897359200": {"Name": "Lin J.T.", "AuthorID": "55897359200", "AffiliationID": "60069716", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University"}, "7403610416": {"Name": "Tsai J.Y.", "AuthorID": "7403610416", "AffiliationID": "60069716", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University"}, "7404978265": {"Name": "Yu C.C.", "AuthorID": "7404978265", "AffiliationID": "60011828, 60004965", "AffiliationName": "Division of Urology, Department of Surgery, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center"}, "36969519300": {"Name": "Chu C.H.", "AuthorID": "36969519300", "AffiliationID": "60014982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, National Cheng Kung University"}, "56355040200": {"Name": "Sridhar A.N.", "AuthorID": "56355040200", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Uro-Oncology, University College London Hospital"}, "57203178690": {"Name": "Sooriakumaran P.", "AuthorID": "57203178690", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Surgical Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "35609458500": {"Name": "Chand M.", "AuthorID": "35609458500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Colorectal Surgery, University College London Hospital"}}}
