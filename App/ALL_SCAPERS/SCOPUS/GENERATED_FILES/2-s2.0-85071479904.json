All rights reserved.Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a methodology to digitally represent all the physical and functional characteristics of a building. Importantly, in smart buildings smart components that are enabled with sensing and actuation need to be modeled accurately within the BIM model. This data representation needs to include multiple status of the smart component based on their performance to guide the design and construction process. However, currently there is not a clear methodology or guideline on how to embed smart components in the BIM model. Visualization techniques have been developed based on CAD technology to integrate smart components in the building model but these techniques have not been applied to BIM environment. To accurately model smart components, the component must be more than a single status representation and must contain complete and accurate dynamic data of the smart component. In this research, data properties, visualization techniques, and categorization of smart components is investigated. Then, through an experimental investigation, nine smart components across five building disciplines are modeled and embedded in a BIM model of a smart space. The model includes parameters that facilitate the data representation of the smart components. Data properties, data organization, and simulation of the smart component within the building model is explained. Challenges and future research is discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Actuators", "BIM", "Sensors", "Smart buildings", "Smart components"], "IndexKeywords": ["Building Information Model - BIM", "Data organization", "Data representations", "Design and construction process", "Experimental investigations", "Functional characteristics", "Smart components", "Visualization technique"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071479904", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"]], "AuthorData": {"56367502400": {"Name": "Afsari K.", "AuthorID": "56367502400", "AffiliationID": "116221624", "AffiliationName": "School of Construction Management Technology, Purdue University"}, "57203014290": {"Name": "Afkhamiaghda M.", "AuthorID": "57203014290", "AffiliationID": "116221624", "AffiliationName": "School of Construction Management Technology, Purdue University"}, "24921429700": {"Name": "Florez L.", "AuthorID": "24921429700", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Department of Architecture and Built Environment, Northumbria University"}, "57210792642": {"Name": "Maneke E.", "AuthorID": "57210792642", "AffiliationID": "116221624", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Graphics Technology, Purdue University"}}}
