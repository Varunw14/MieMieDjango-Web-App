Moringa oleifera Lam. plant has many medical and nutritional uses; however, little attention has been dedicated to its potential for the bio production of active compounds. In this study, 431 conserved and 392 novel microRNA families were identified and 9 novel small RNA libraries constructed from leaf, and cold stress treated callus, using high-throughput sequencing technology. Based on the M. oleifera genome, the microRNA repertoire of the seed was re-evaluated. qRT-PCR analysis confirmed the expression pattern of 11 conserved microRNAs in all groups. MicroRNA159 was found to be the most abundant conserved microRNA in leaf and callus, while microRNA393 was most abundantly expressed in the seed. The majority of predicted microRNA target genes were transcriptional factors involved in plant reproduction, growth/development and abiotic/biotic stress response. In conclusion, this is the first comprehensive analysis of microRNAs in M. oleifera leaf and callus which represents an important addition to the existing M. oleifera seed microRNA database and allows for possible exploitation of plant microRNAs induced with abiotic stress, as a tool for bio-enrichment with pharmacologically important phytochemicals.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cold Temperature", "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant", "Gene Ontology", "Genes, Plant", "MicroRNAs", "Moringa oleifera", "Plant Leaves", "Reproducibility of Results", "RNA, Plant"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073745317", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57211398635": {"Name": "Stefano P.", "AuthorID": "57211398635", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Bioinformatics Unit, Centre for Molecular Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University London"}, "57211397982": {"Name": "Ivana M.", "AuthorID": "57211397982", "AffiliationID": "60027509", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Rome Tor Vergata"}, "57211390344": {"Name": "Vittorio C.", "AuthorID": "57211390344", "AffiliationID": "60027509", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Rome Tor Vergata"}, "57211394501": {"Name": "Andrea G.", "AuthorID": "57211394501", "AffiliationID": "60027509", "AffiliationName": "CIMETA, University of Rome Tor Vergata"}, "57211393415": {"Name": "Letizia Z.", "AuthorID": "57211393415", "AffiliationID": "60027509", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Rome Tor Vergata"}, "56715755600": {"Name": "Angelo G.", "AuthorID": "56715755600", "AffiliationID": "60027509", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Rome Tor Vergata"}, "56981802400": {"Name": "Antonella C.", "AuthorID": "56981802400", "AffiliationID": "60027509", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Rome Tor Vergata"}, "57211389646": {"Name": "Arianna G.", "AuthorID": "57211389646", "AffiliationID": "60027509", "AffiliationName": "CIMETA, University of Rome Tor Vergata"}, "57211397971": {"Name": "Rosella C.", "AuthorID": "57211397971", "AffiliationID": "60027509", "AffiliationName": "CIMETA, University of Rome Tor Vergata"}, "57211393624": {"Name": "Roberta B.", "AuthorID": "57211393624", "AffiliationID": "60027509", "AffiliationName": "CIMETA, University of Rome Tor Vergata"}, "57211398141": {"Name": "Maurizio M.", "AuthorID": "57211398141", "AffiliationID": "60027509", "AffiliationName": "CIMETA, University of Rome Tor Vergata"}}}
