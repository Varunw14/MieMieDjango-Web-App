In 2019, securing an ST1 post in neurosurgery corresponds to competition ration of 6.54 whereas a CST1 post 2.93. Further, at ST3 level, neurosurgery is the most competitive. In addition, the number of neurosurgical training posts are likely to be reduced in the coming years. A number of very specific shortlisting criteria, aiming to filter and select the best candidates for interview exist. In the context of the high competition ratios and the specific shortlisting criteria, developing an interest in the neurosciences early on will allow individuals more time to meet the necessary standards for neurosurgery. Here, we aim to outline the shortlisting criteria and offer advice on how to achieve maximum scores, increasing the likelihood to be shortlisted for an interview.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Neurosurgery", "Surgery", "Training"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089409531", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"]], "AuthorData": {"57210560426": {"Name": "Solomou G.", "AuthorID": "57210560426", "AffiliationID": "60019202", "AffiliationName": "Keele University Medical School"}, "57211124450": {"Name": "Murphy S.", "AuthorID": "57211124450", "AffiliationID": "60014241", "AffiliationName": "UCD School of Medicine and Medical Science"}, "57205736837": {"Name": "Bandyopadhyay S.", "AuthorID": "57205736837", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Oxford University Medical School"}, "57216777271": {"Name": "Horsfall H.L.", "AuthorID": "57216777271", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60017488", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurosurgery, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Addenbrooke's Hospital and University of Cambridge"}, "57220725162": {"Name": "Mohan M.", "AuthorID": "57220725162", "AffiliationID": "60016390, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Academic Division of Neurosurgery, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and University of Cambridge"}, "55204436800": {"Name": "Chari A.", "AuthorID": "55204436800", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Great Ormond Street Hospital, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "36633204100": {"Name": "Sinha S.", "AuthorID": "36633204100", "AffiliationID": "60029387, 60024453", "AffiliationName": "Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust and Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56490194900": {"Name": "Mendoza N.", "AuthorID": "56490194900", "AffiliationID": "60012558", "AffiliationName": "West London Neurosciences Unit, Charing Cross Hospital NHS Trust"}}}
