The aims of this study were to identify genetic predisposition to elite athletic performance by investigating genetically-influenced metabolites that discriminate elite athletes from non-elite athletes and to identify those associated with endurance sports. By conducting a genome wide association study with high-resolution metabolomics profiling in 490 elite athletes, common variant metabolic quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) were identified and compared with previously identified mQTLs in non-elite athletes. Among the identified mQTLs, those associated with endurance metabolites were determined. Two novel genetic loci in FOLH1 and VNN1 are reported in association with N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate and Linoleoyl ethanolamide, respectively. When focusing on endurance metabolites, one novel mQTL linking androstenediol (3alpha, 17alpha) monosulfate and SULT2A1 was identified. Potential interactions between the novel identified mQTLs and exercise are highlighted. This is the first report of common variant mQTLs linked to elite athletic performance and endurance sports with potential applications in biomarker discovery in elite athletic candidates, non-conventional anti-doping analytical approaches and therapeutic strategies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Athletes", "Female", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Genotype", "Humans", "Male", "Physical Endurance", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Quantitative Trait Loci"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077336462", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57190008836": {"Name": "Al-Khelaifi F.", "AuthorID": "57190008836", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "7004238414": {"Name": "Georgakopoulos C.", "AuthorID": "7004238414", "AffiliationID": "60116711", "AffiliationName": "Anti Doping Laboratory Qatar, Sports City"}, "57203195982": {"Name": "Abraham D.", "AuthorID": "57203195982", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "12788772700": {"Name": "Diboun I.", "AuthorID": "12788772700", "AffiliationID": "60113880, 60104772", "AffiliationName": "College of Health and Life Sciences, Hamad Bin Khalifa University"}, "57221837943": {"Name": "Albagha O.", "AuthorID": "57221837943", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Center for Genomic and Experimental Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}, "35309902400": {"Name": "Donati F.", "AuthorID": "35309902400", "AffiliationID": "100470327", "AffiliationName": "Laboratorio Antidoping, Federazione Medico Sportiva Italiana"}, "7003288177": {"Name": "Botr\u00e8 F.", "AuthorID": "7003288177", "AffiliationID": "100470327", "AffiliationName": "Laboratorio Antidoping, Federazione Medico Sportiva Italiana"}, "7005545809": {"Name": "Hingorani A.", "AuthorID": "7005545809", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "56188100500": {"Name": "Suhre K.", "AuthorID": "56188100500", "AffiliationID": "60106067, 60072750", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar, Qatar-Foundation"}, "23981703800": {"Name": "Yousri N.A.", "AuthorID": "23981703800", "AffiliationID": "60033041", "AffiliationName": "Computer and Systems Engineering, Alexandria University"}, "6507184948": {"Name": "Elrayess M.A.", "AuthorID": "6507184948", "AffiliationID": "60072749", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Center, Qatar University"}}}
