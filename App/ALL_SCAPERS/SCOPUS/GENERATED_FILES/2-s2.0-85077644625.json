However, their findings could contribute to the evidence base underpinning science and practice within international justice system contexts. There are two main challenges to making findings accessible: reaching all criminal justice stakeholders, and encouraging collaborative efforts in research addressing \u2018real world\u2019 problems. This article presents the rationale for a new, open access repository. The aim is to share good quality pre-doctoral and practitioner criminal justice research across traditional disciplinary and international borders. Such a repository should be easy to use, well maintained and sustainable. Its reach, value and impact also need to be measurable. We present the major considerations relating to the operation and workflow of such a repository, and outline the potential value, benefits and limitations. Our research suggests that the proposed repository could foster interdisciplinary and collaborative work to benefit global justice systems and societies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Justice", "Open access", "Practitioner research", "Repository", "Student research"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077644625", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"55260938400": {"Name": "Bolton-King R.S.", "AuthorID": "55260938400", "AffiliationID": "60021219", "AffiliationName": "Department of Criminal Justice & Forensic Science, Staffordshire University"}, "55410938300": {"Name": "Cassella J.P.", "AuthorID": "55410938300", "AffiliationID": "60021219", "AffiliationName": "Department of Criminal Justice & Forensic Science, Staffordshire University"}, "55849535500": {"Name": "Kara H.", "AuthorID": "55849535500", "AffiliationID": "113864988", "AffiliationName": "We Research It Ltd."}, "24336237800": {"Name": "Rankin B.W.J.", "AuthorID": "24336237800", "AffiliationID": "123744341", "AffiliationName": "Chair of Quality Standards, Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences and Chair of KTN Special Interest Group Forensic Science"}, "57194780985": {"Name": "Morgan R.M.", "AuthorID": "57194780985", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Security and Crime Science, UCL Centre for the Forensic Sciences, University College London"}, "57201135079": {"Name": "Burke S.", "AuthorID": "57201135079", "AffiliationID": "60099919", "AffiliationName": "Jisc"}, "36633855300": {"Name": "Fripp D.", "AuthorID": "36633855300", "AffiliationID": "60099919", "AffiliationName": "Jisc"}, "57193735152": {"Name": "Kaye J.P.", "AuthorID": "57193735152", "AffiliationID": "60099919", "AffiliationName": "Jisc"}}}
