Therefore, studies about urban economies' energy use profiles should pay special attention to the tremendous energy transfers embodied in their trade connections along the whole supply chain. In this regard, a three-scale input-output model which distinguishes local, domestic and foreign activities is devised to reflect cross border embodied energy perspective for urban economies, with an intensive case study for Beijing during 2002\u20132012. The results show that domestic imports dominate Beijing's total embodied energy use, while local energy exploitation accounts for less than one-tenths of the final use. Regarding to energy use embodied in trade, headquarter effect contributes significantly to the rapid growth of embodied energy inflows and outflows. Embodied energy transfers induced by headquarter effect almost doubled in the case period. Different industries show distinct embodied energy redistribution evolution characteristics. Moreover, the complete source-to-sink budget is constructed, implying that coal use still dominates Beijing's total embodied energy inputs. Analysis in this study highlights the importance to consider the impacts of headquarter effect on Beijing's embodied energy use and redistribution pattern, pointing the potential room for policy implications aimed to realize collective and inclusive governance of global energy supply chain.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Domestic and international trade", "Embodied energy", "Headquarter effect", "Three-scale input-output analysis", "Urban economy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cross-border trades", "Embodied energy", "Energy use profile", "Evolution characteristics", "Input output model", "Policy implications", "Scale analysis", "Source to sinks"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084750460", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Waste Management and Disposal", "ENVI", "2311"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"]], "AuthorData": {"57195110594": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "57195110594", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Systems Ecology and Sustainability Science, College of Engineering, Peking University"}, "57216465558": {"Name": "Chen B.", "AuthorID": "57216465558", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Systems Ecology and Sustainability Science, College of Engineering, Peking University"}, "7406541589": {"Name": "Chen G.", "AuthorID": "7406541589", "AffiliationID": "60004582", "AffiliationName": "Center of Research Excellence of Renewable Energy and Power Systems, Faculty of Engineering, King Abdulaziz University"}, "55975044300": {"Name": "Meng J.", "AuthorID": "55975044300", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Politics and International Studies, University of Cambridge"}, "57208121687": {"Name": "Hayat T.", "AuthorID": "57208121687", "AffiliationID": "60004582", "AffiliationName": "HAAM Group, Faculty of Science, King Abdulaziz University"}}}
