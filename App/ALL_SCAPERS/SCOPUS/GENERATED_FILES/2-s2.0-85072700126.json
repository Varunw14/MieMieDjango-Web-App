However, there are limited reports of how longitudinal NfL relates to imaging biomarkers. We herein investigated the relationship between blood NfL and brain metabolism in AD. Methods: Voxelwise regression models tested the cross-sectional association between [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) and both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid NfL in cognitively impaired and unimpaired subjects. Linear mixed models were also used to test the longitudinal association between NfL and [18F]FDG in amyloid positive (A\u03b2+) and negative (A\u03b2\u2212) subjects. Results: Higher concentrations of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid NfL were associated with reduced [18F]FDG uptake in correspondent brain regions. In A\u03b2+ participants, NfL associates with hypometabolism in AD-vulnerable regions. Longitudinal changes in the association [18F]FDG-NfL were confined to cognitively impaired A\u03b2+ individuals. Discussion: These findings indicate that plasma NfL is a proxy for neurodegeneration in AD-related regions in A\u03b2+ subjects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Biomarkers", "Blood", "Hypometabolism", "Longitudinal", "Neurodegeneration", "Neurofilament light", "PET", "[18F]FDG"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072700126", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"36150373200": {"Name": "Benedet A.L.", "AuthorID": "36150373200", "AffiliationID": "60019709", "AffiliationName": "CAPES Foundation, Ministry of Education of Brazil"}, "55653354700": {"Name": "Pascoal T.A.", "AuthorID": "55653354700", "AffiliationID": "60008004, 60002494", "AffiliationName": "Translational Neuroimaging Laboratory, McGill Centre for Studies in Aging, McGill University"}, "56989889600": {"Name": "Mathotaarachchi S.", "AuthorID": "56989889600", "AffiliationID": "60008004, 60002494", "AffiliationName": "Translational Neuroimaging Laboratory, McGill Centre for Studies in Aging, McGill University"}, "57188576130": {"Name": "Kang M.S.", "AuthorID": "57188576130", "AffiliationID": "60008004, 60002494", "AffiliationName": "Translational Neuroimaging Laboratory, McGill Centre for Studies in Aging, McGill University"}, "57193761477": {"Name": "Therriault J.", "AuthorID": "57193761477", "AffiliationID": "60008004, 60002494", "AffiliationName": "Translational Neuroimaging Laboratory, McGill Centre for Studies in Aging, McGill University"}, "57169968300": {"Name": "Savard M.", "AuthorID": "57169968300", "AffiliationID": "60008004, 60002494", "AffiliationName": "Translational Neuroimaging Laboratory, McGill Centre for Studies in Aging, McGill University"}, "57192390374": {"Name": "Chamoun M.", "AuthorID": "57192390374", "AffiliationID": "60008004, 60002494", "AffiliationName": "Translational Neuroimaging Laboratory, McGill Centre for Studies in Aging, McGill University"}, "57193164735": {"Name": "Neto P.R.", "AuthorID": "57193164735", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, McGill University"}, "55498735800": {"Name": "Ashton N.J.", "AuthorID": "55498735800", "AffiliationID": "60028884, 60171762", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Mental Health and Biomedical Research Unit for Dementia at South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation"}, "35070295800": {"Name": "Sch\u00f6ll M.", "AuthorID": "35070295800", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57208899083": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "57208899083", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL"}, "7101909602": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "7101909602", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "35484474600": {"Name": "Leuzy A.", "AuthorID": "35484474600", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Memory Research Unit, Department of Clinical Sciences, Malm\u00f6, Lund University"}, "57203095180": {"Name": "Zimmer E.R.", "AuthorID": "57203095180", "AffiliationID": "60006726", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"}, "57202477003": {"Name": "Gauthier S.", "AuthorID": "57202477003", "AffiliationID": "60008004, 60002494", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer's Disease Research Unit, The McGill University Research Centre for Studies in Aging, Montreal, McGill University"}, "55049867600": {"Name": "Labbe A.", "AuthorID": "55049867600", "AffiliationID": "60002970", "AffiliationName": "Department of Decision Sciences, HEC Montreal"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
