The various MIMO technologies have been based on placing a number of antennas at some fixed locations which dictate the fundamental limit on the achievable performance. By contrast, this paper envisages the scenario in which the physical position of an antenna can be switched freely to one of the N positions over a fixed-length line space to pick up the strongest signal in the manner of traditional selection combining. We refer to this system as a fluid antenna system (FAS) for tremendous flexibility in its possible shape and position. The aim of this paper is to study the achievable performance of a single-antenna FAS system with a fixed length and N in arbitrarily correlated Rayleigh fading channels. Our contributions include exact and approximate closed-form expressions for the outage probability of FAS.We also derive an upper bound for the outage probability, from which it is discovered that a single-antenna FAS given any arbitrarily small space can outperform an L-antenna maximum ratio combining (MRC) system if N is large enough. Our analysis also reveals the minimum required size of the FAS, and how large N is considered enough for the FAS to surpass MRC.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diversity", "Fluid antennas", "MIMO", "Multiple antennas", "Outage probability", "Selection combining"], "IndexKeywords": ["Achievable performance", "Closed-form expression", "Correlated Rayleigh fading channels", "Maximum ratio combining", "Multiple-antenna technology", "Multiplexing gains", "Selection combining", "Wireless communications"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096846225", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"7404759940": {"Name": "Wong K.K.", "AuthorID": "7404759940", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": null}, "54386020900": {"Name": "Shojaeifard A.", "AuthorID": "54386020900", "AffiliationID": "60014174", "AffiliationName": null}, "7102473419": {"Name": "Tong K.F.", "AuthorID": "7102473419", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": null}, "57221364012": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "57221364012", "AffiliationID": "121400464", "AffiliationName": null}}}
