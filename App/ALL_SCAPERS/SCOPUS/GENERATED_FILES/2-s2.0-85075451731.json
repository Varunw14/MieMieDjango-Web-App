This is mainly due to the number of arthroplasties performed each year and our ability to capture more cases. There is currently no consensus in the optimal diagnosis and management of the infected total hip arthroplasty. Various management techniques have been described in literature. Areas covered: We discuss and summarize the literature in diagnosing prosthetic joint infection (PJI) including next-generation sequencing. An in-depth critical analysis of the biomarkers and the novel tests available in the market is reviewed including the evolving nature of the diagnostic criteria for PJI. The key issues in managing infected THA are identified. Expert commentary: The senior authors' expert opinion on diagnostic criteria is discussed. We also stress the importance of tissue/fluid analysis of microbiology and histology being key to diagnosis of PJI. The indications of one-stage versus two-stage revision arthroplasty is examined, including techniques for successful one-stage revision.", "AuthorKeywords": ["alpha defensin", "next generation sequencing", "one stage versus two stage", "PJI", "prosthetic joint infection"], "IndexKeywords": ["Arthroplasties", "Critical analysis", "Defensins", "Expert opinion", "Management techniques", "Next-generation sequencing", "Prosthetic joints", "Total hip arthroplasty", "Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip", "Biomarkers", "Hip Prosthesis", "Humans", "Prosthesis-Related Infections", "Reoperation", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075451731", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"35585275900": {"Name": "Ahmed S.S.", "AuthorID": "35585275900", "AffiliationID": "122326586", "AffiliationName": "Trauma & Orthopaedics, Princess Grace Hospital"}, "57205729820": {"Name": "Begum F.", "AuthorID": "57205729820", "AffiliationID": "122326586", "AffiliationName": "Trauma & Orthopaedics, Princess Grace Hospital"}, "53979939900": {"Name": "Kayani B.", "AuthorID": "53979939900", "AffiliationID": "122326586", "AffiliationName": "Trauma & Orthopaedics, Princess Grace Hospital"}, "7203033976": {"Name": "Haddad F.S.", "AuthorID": "7203033976", "AffiliationID": "122326586", "AffiliationName": "Trauma & Orthopaedics, Princess Grace Hospital"}}}
