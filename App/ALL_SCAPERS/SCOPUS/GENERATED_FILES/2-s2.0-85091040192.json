ESC Heart Failure published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of the European Society of CardiologyAims: Cardiomyopathies are a heterogeneous group of disorders that increase the risk for atrial fibrillation (AF). The aim of the study is to assess the prevalence of AF, anticoagulation management, and risk of stroke/transient ischaemic attack (TIA) in patients with cardiomyopathy. Methods and results: Three thousand two hundred eight consecutive adult patients with cardiomyopathy (34.9% female; median age: 55.0 years) were prospectively enrolled as part of the EURObservational Research Programme Cardiomyopathy/Myocarditis Registry. At baseline, 903 (28.2%) patients had AF (29.4% dilated, 27.5% hypertrophic, 51.5% restrictive, and 14.7% arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, P < 0.001). AF was associated with more advanced New York Heart Association class (P < 0.001), increased prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and co-morbidities, and a history of stroke/TIA (P < 0.001). Oral anticoagulation was administered in 71.7% of patients with AF (vitamin K antagonist: 51.6%; direct oral anticoagulant: 20.1%). At 1 year follow-up, the incidence of cardiovascular endpoints was as follows: stroke/TIA 1.85% (AF vs. non-AF: 3.17% vs. 1.19%, P < 0.001), death from any cause 3.43% (AF vs. non-AF: 5.39% vs. 2.50%, P < 0.001), and death from heart failure 1.67% (AF vs. non-AF: 2.44% vs. 1.31%, P = 0.033). The independent predictors for stroke/TIA were as follows: AF [odds ratio (OR) 2.812, P = 0.005], history of stroke (OR 7.311, P = 0.010), and anaemia (OR 3.119, P = 0.006). Conclusions: The study reveals a high prevalence and diverse distribution of AF in patients with cardiomyopathies, inadequate anticoagulation regimen, and high risk of stroke/TIA in this population.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anticoagulation", "Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy", "Atrial fibrillation", "Dilated cardiomyopathy", "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy", "Restrictive cardiomyopathy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091040192", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"7003395992": {"Name": "Mizia-Stec K.", "AuthorID": "7003395992", "AffiliationID": "60027573", "AffiliationName": "First Department of Cardiology, School of Medicine in Katowice, Medical University of Silesia"}, "7005166754": {"Name": "Caforio A.L.P.", "AuthorID": "7005166754", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Cardiological Thoracic and Vascular Sciences and Public Health, University of Padua"}, "57203044890": {"Name": "Charron P.", "AuthorID": "57203044890", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, INSERM UMR1166"}, "7005858968": {"Name": "Gimeno J.R.", "AuthorID": "7005858968", "AffiliationID": "60029675", "AffiliationName": "Cardiac Department, Hospital Universitario Virgen de la Arrixaca"}, "57202356433": {"Name": "Elliott P.", "AuthorID": "57202356433", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60004093", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Cardiac Diseases Unit, Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital and University College London (UCL)"}, "16204898600": {"Name": "Kaski J.P.", "AuthorID": "16204898600", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Inherited Cardiovascular Diseases, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "57203255222": {"Name": "Maggioni A.P.", "AuthorID": "57203255222", "AffiliationID": "60172681", "AffiliationName": "ANMCO Research Center"}, "7102361087": {"Name": "Laroche C.", "AuthorID": "7102361087", "AffiliationID": "100416509", "AffiliationName": "EURObservational Research Programme, European Society of Cardiology"}, "57213176019": {"Name": "Tavazzi L.", "AuthorID": "57213176019", "AffiliationID": "60086672, 60117076", "AffiliationName": "Maria Cecilia Hospital, GVM Care and Research"}, "6701402043": {"Name": "Rigopoulos A.G.", "AuthorID": "6701402043", "AffiliationID": "60019016, 60014059", "AffiliationName": "Mid-German Heart Center, Department of Internal Medicine III, Division of Cardiology, Angiology and Intensive Medical Care, University Hospital Halle, Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg"}, "15842992800": {"Name": "Frigy A.", "AuthorID": "15842992800", "AffiliationID": "108093134", "AffiliationName": "Clinical County Hospital"}, "6603551403": {"Name": "Zachara E.", "AuthorID": "6603551403", "AffiliationID": "60011296", "AffiliationName": "San Camillo Hospital"}, "57035345000": {"Name": "Pena-Pena M.L.", "AuthorID": "57035345000", "AffiliationID": "60033267", "AffiliationName": "Cardiac Imaging and Inherited Cardiac Diseases Unit, Department of Cardiology, Virgen del Rocio University Hospital"}, "57200819266": {"Name": "Olusegun-Joseph A.", "AuthorID": "57200819266", "AffiliationID": "60006448, 60024019, 60026284", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Unit, Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Lagos, Lagos University Teaching Hospital"}, "7005881276": {"Name": "Pinto Y.", "AuthorID": "7005881276", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Academic Medical Center"}, "35598475200": {"Name": "Sala S.", "AuthorID": "35598475200", "AffiliationID": "60082964", "AffiliationName": "San Raffaele Hospital"}, "7101962434": {"Name": "Drago F.", "AuthorID": "7101962434", "AffiliationID": "60017905", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Cardiology, Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children's Hospital and Research Institute"}, "6602410317": {"Name": "Blagova O.", "AuthorID": "6602410317", "AffiliationID": "60010188", "AffiliationName": "I.M.
