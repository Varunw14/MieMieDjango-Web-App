Methods: Retrospective case-series. Thirteen eyes of pediatric patients with a diagnosis of unilateral Coats disease of various stages were compared with 13 fellow eyes. Optical coherence tomography angiography images were acquired using the RTVue XR Avanti. Scans were analyzed with novel projection artifact removal software and improved segmentation. Vascular density and foveal avascular zone area were calculated. Results: Vascular density was significantly decreased in eyes with Coats disease in comparison with fellow eyes in both the superficial capillary plexus and deep capillary plexus (43.7 \u00b1 4.7 vs. 45.9 \u00b1 4.4 [P = 0.000] and 43.0 \u00b1 6.3 vs. 50.3 \u00b1 2.2 [P = 0.001], respectively). The difference was also significant for most sectors of the macula. Foveal avascular zone area was significantly larger in eyes with Coats disease in comparison with fellow eyes (0.29 \u00b1 0.1 vs. 0.24 \u00b1 0.09 [P = 0.003]). These significant differences appeared as early as Stage 2A, preceding clinical findings. Conclusion: The findings support the unilaterality of Coats disease and show that vascular changes on optical coherence tomography angiography precede clinical staging of the condition.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coats disease", "OCTA", "OCTA", "PAR", "Pediatric", "Unilateral"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Female", "Fluorescein Angiography", "Humans", "Macula Lutea", "Male", "Retinal Telangiectasis", "Retinal Vessels", "Retrospective Studies", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Visual Acuity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075741828", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"55820358700": {"Name": "Schwartz R.", "AuthorID": "55820358700", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "35547907400": {"Name": "Sivaprasad S.", "AuthorID": "35547907400", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57215269546": {"Name": "Macphee R.", "AuthorID": "57215269546", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57195264998": {"Name": "Ibanez P.", "AuthorID": "57195264998", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "24480921100": {"Name": "Keane P.A.", "AuthorID": "24480921100", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57202482672": {"Name": "Michaelides M.", "AuthorID": "57202482672", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57199513090": {"Name": "Wong S.C.", "AuthorID": "57199513090", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57217994850": {"Name": "Wong S.C.", "AuthorID": "57217994850", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "57217994859": {"Name": "Wong S.C.", "AuthorID": "57217994859", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free Hospital"}}}
