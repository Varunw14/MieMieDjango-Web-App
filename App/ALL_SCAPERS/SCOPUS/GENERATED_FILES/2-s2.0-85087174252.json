Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaAThe major challenge in solar water splitting to H2 and O2 is in making a stable and affordable system for large-scale applications. We have designed, fabricated, and tested a photoelectrochemical reactor characterized as follows: 1) it comprises an integrated device to reduce the balance of the system cost, 2) it utilizes concentrated sunlight to reduce the photoabsorber cost, and 3) it employs and alkaline electrolyte to reduce catalyst cost and eliminate external thermal management needs. The system consists of an III-V-based photovoltaic cell integrated with Ni foil as an O2 evolution catalyst that also protects the cell from corrosion. At low light concentration, without the use of optical lenses, the solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency was 18.3 %, while at high light concentration (up to 207 suns) with the use of optical lenses, the STH efficiency was 13 %. Catalytic tests conducted for over 100 hours at 100\u2013200 suns showed no sign of degradation nor deviation from product stoichiometry (H2/O2=2). Further tests projected a system stability of years.", "AuthorKeywords": ["concentrated sunlight", "hydrogen production", "nickel oxide", "OER catalyst stability", "photoelectrochemistry"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alkaline electrolytes", "Catalytic tests", "Concentrated sunlights", "Integrated device", "Large-scale applications", "Photoelectrochemical reactor", "Solar water splitting", "Solar-to-hydrogen"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087174252", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"55587505200": {"Name": "Khan M.A.", "AuthorID": "55587505200", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "Hydrogen Platform, SABIC-Corporate Research and Development (CRD) center, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)"}, "55845908300": {"Name": "Al-Shankiti I.", "AuthorID": "55845908300", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "Hydrogen Platform, SABIC-Corporate Research and Development (CRD) center, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)"}, "24473662600": {"Name": "Ziani A.", "AuthorID": "24473662600", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "Hydrogen Platform, SABIC-Corporate Research and Development (CRD) center, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)"}, "7006768868": {"Name": "Idriss H.", "AuthorID": "7006768868", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "Hydrogen Platform, SABIC-Corporate Research and Development (CRD) center, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)"}, "24339660200": {"Name": "Wehbe N.", "AuthorID": "24339660200", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "Imaging & Characterization Core Lab, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)"}}}
