Advances in sequencing-based assays have enabled investigation of these processes genome-wide, leading to large datasets that combine information on the dynamics of gene expression, transcription factor binding and chromatin structure as cells differentiate. While numerous studies focus on the effects of these features on broader gene regulation, less work has been done on the mechanisms of gene-specific transcriptional control. In this study, we have focussed on the latter by integrating gene expression data for the in vitro differentiation of murine ES cells to macrophages and cardiomyocytes, with dynamic data on chromatin structure, epigenetics and transcription factor binding. Combining a novel strategy to identify communities of related control elements with a penalized regression approach, we developed individual models to identify the potential control elements predictive of the expression of each gene. Our models were compared to an existing method and evaluated using the existing literature and new experimental data from embryonic stem cell differentiation reporter assays. Our method is able to identify transcriptional control elements in a gene specific manner that reflect known regulatory relationships and to generate useful hypotheses for further testing.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Chromatin", "Databases, Genetic", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Epigenomics", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Genome", "High-Throughput Screening Assays", "Macrophages", "Mice", "Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "Regulatory Elements, Transcriptional", "Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid", "Transcription Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075095275", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"]], "AuthorData": {"56121435900": {"Name": "Vijayabaskar M.S.", "AuthorID": "56121435900", "AffiliationID": "60005517", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Sanger Institute"}, "57211825182": {"Name": "Emmett A.M.L.", "AuthorID": "57211825182", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Leeds"}, "57211826100": {"Name": "Abidin F.N.Z.", "AuthorID": "57211826100", "AffiliationID": "60001821", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Systems Biology (INBIOSIS), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia"}, "57192105421": {"Name": "Shar N.", "AuthorID": "57192105421", "AffiliationID": "60060302", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, NED University of Engineering and Technology"}, "7003541231": {"Name": "Westhead D.R.", "AuthorID": "7003541231", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Leeds"}, "7006862531": {"Name": "Goode D.K.", "AuthorID": "7006862531", "AffiliationID": "60103296, 60031101, 60105833", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust and MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge"}, "37104043700": {"Name": "Hannah R.", "AuthorID": "37104043700", "AffiliationID": "60103296, 60031101, 60105833", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust and MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge"}, "6701818487": {"Name": "Gottgens B.", "AuthorID": "6701818487", "AffiliationID": "60103296, 60031101, 60105833", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust and MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge"}, "34971912400": {"Name": "Obier N.", "AuthorID": "34971912400", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "22135655300": {"Name": "Lichtinger M.", "AuthorID": "22135655300", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "35848125000": {"Name": "Assi S.A.", "AuthorID": "35848125000", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "57193253134": {"Name": "Bonifer C.", "AuthorID": "57193253134", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "35302579700": {"Name": "Lie-A-Ling M.", "AuthorID": "35302579700", "AffiliationID": "60120602, 60003771", "AffiliationName": "CRUK Manchester Institute, University of Manchester"}, "6603242906": {"Name": "Lacaud G.", "AuthorID": "6603242906", "AffiliationID": "60120602, 60003771", "AffiliationName": "CRUK Manchester Institute, University of Manchester"}, "6603599491": {"Name": "Kouskoff V.", "AuthorID": "6603599491", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Division of Developmental Biology and Medicine, University of Manchester"}}}
