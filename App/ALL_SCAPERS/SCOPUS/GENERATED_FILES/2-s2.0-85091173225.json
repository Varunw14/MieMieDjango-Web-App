Mechanistic studies of intestinal barrier function embedded in a large probiotic trial could provide evidence about which properties of probiotics might be important for NEC prevention thus facilitating identification of strains with therapeutic potential. Methods: Intestinal permeability, stool microbiota, SCFAs and mucosal inflammation were assessed from the second postnatal week in babies enrolled to a randomised controlled trial of B. breve BBG-001 (the PiPS trial). Results were compared by allocation and by stool colonisation with the probiotic. Results: Ninety-four preterm babies were recruited across six nested studies. B. breve BBG-001 content was higher by allocation and colonisation; Enterobacteriaceae and acetic acid levels were higher by colonisation. No measure of intestinal barrier function showed differences. The PiPS trial found no evidence of efficacy to reduce NEC. Conclusions: That the negative results of the PiPS trial were associated with failure of this probiotic to modify intestinal barrier function supports the possibility that the tests described here have the potential to identify strains to progress to large clinical trials. Impact: Uncertainty about the therapeutic role of probiotics to prevent necrotising enterocolitis is in part due to the wide range of bacterial strains with no previous evidence of efficacy used in clinical trials.We hypothesised that mechanistic studies embedded in a probiotic trial would provide evidence about which properties of probiotics might be important for NEC prevention.The finding that the probiotic strain tested, Bifidobacterium breve BBG-001, showed neither effects on intestinal barrier function nor clinical efficacy supports the possibility that these tests have the potential to identify strains to progress to large clinical trials.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091173225", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"56909469200": {"Name": "Fleming P.", "AuthorID": "56909469200", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Genomics and Child Health, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57219052988": {"Name": "Akyempon A.", "AuthorID": "57219052988", "AffiliationID": "60005523", "AffiliationName": "Homerton University Hospital, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7003504305": {"Name": "Costeloe K.", "AuthorID": "7003504305", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Genomics and Child Health, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57202777721": {"Name": "Hutchinson R.", "AuthorID": "57202777721", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Genomics and Child Health, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57204264962": {"Name": "Wilks M.", "AuthorID": "57204264962", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7102417500": {"Name": "Millar M.R.", "AuthorID": "7102417500", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57189075219": {"Name": "Panton N.", "AuthorID": "57189075219", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57205586306": {"Name": "Eaton S.", "AuthorID": "57205586306", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "35560730300": {"Name": "Hardy P.", "AuthorID": "35560730300", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit, University of Birmingham"}}}
