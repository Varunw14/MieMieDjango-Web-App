These techniques provide sensitive markers of macrostructural and microstructural tissue integrity, which correlate with histological findings. Spinal cord MRI findings in traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI) and nontraumatic spinal cord injury \u2014 the most common form of which is degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) \u2014 have provided important insights into the pathophysiological processes taking place not just at the focal injury site but also rostral and caudal to the spinal injury. Although tSCI and DCM have different aetiologies, they show similar degrees of spinal cord pathology remote from the injury site, suggesting the involvement of similar secondary degenerative mechanisms. Advanced quantitative MRI protocols that are sensitive to spinal cord pathology have the potential to improve diagnosis and, more importantly, predict outcomes in patients with tSCI or nontraumatic spinal cord injury. This Review describes the insights into tSCI and DCM that have been revealed by neuroimaging and outlines current activities and future directions for the field.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Diffusion Tensor Imaging", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Neuroimaging", "Spinal Cord Injuries"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074681126", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"57188986656": {"Name": "David G.", "AuthorID": "57188986656", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Department of Systems Neuroscience, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"}, "14037413900": {"Name": "Freund P.", "AuthorID": "14037413900", "AffiliationID": "60019636, 60019619, 60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich"}, "25823875500": {"Name": "Mohammadi S.", "AuthorID": "25823875500", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6602786222": {"Name": "Weiskopf N.", "AuthorID": "6602786222", "AffiliationID": "60025323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurophysics, Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences"}, "57013854300": {"Name": "Martin A.R.", "AuthorID": "57013854300", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurosurgery, Department of Surgery, University of Toronto"}, "24777793300": {"Name": "Cohen-Adad J.", "AuthorID": "24777793300", "AffiliationID": "60019141", "AffiliationName": "NeuroPoly Lab, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Polytechnique Montreal"}, "57220858317": {"Name": "Thompson A.", "AuthorID": "57220858317", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
