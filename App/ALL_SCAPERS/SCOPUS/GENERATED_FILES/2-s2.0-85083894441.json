This paper aims to assess sustainability and obtain its spatio-temporal dynamics, analyze the cause of sustainability changing conditions, and o?er suggestions on the sustainable development of traditional villages. We integrated human disturbances into a minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model based on land use, landscape patterns, and ecosystem service (ES) provision in order to evaluate the sustainability dynamics of traditional villages between 1995 and 2015 in the Qiannan Prefecture, China. The results showed that pronounced declines in sustainability were limited to the northern and eastern regions, where the degradation of forest ecosystems and the rapid increase in construction land have resulted in landscape fragmentation and ES decline. We suggest that scienti?c land use development plans and ecological restoration should be implemented to protect the ecosystem and improve the sustainability of traditional villages in Qiannan Prefecture.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ecosystem services", "Human disturbance", "Landscape pattern", "Sustainability assessment"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083894441", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"57094394900": {"Name": "Xiao Y.", "AuthorID": "57094394900", "AffiliationID": "60032275", "AffiliationName": "College of Life and Environmental Sciences, Minzu University of China"}, "57216564639": {"Name": "Zhao J.", "AuthorID": "57216564639", "AffiliationID": "60032275", "AffiliationName": "College of Life and Environmental Sciences, Minzu University of China"}, "57201077821": {"Name": "Sun S.", "AuthorID": "57201077821", "AffiliationID": "60032275", "AffiliationName": "College of Life and Environmental Sciences, Minzu University of China"}, "8280511500": {"Name": "Guo L.", "AuthorID": "8280511500", "AffiliationID": "60032275", "AffiliationName": "College of Life and Environmental Sciences, Minzu University of China"}, "8330656600": {"Name": "Sang W.", "AuthorID": "8330656600", "AffiliationID": "60032275", "AffiliationName": "College of Life and Environmental Sciences, Minzu University of China"}, "15062311900": {"Name": "Axmacher J.", "AuthorID": "15062311900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Geography, University College London"}}}
