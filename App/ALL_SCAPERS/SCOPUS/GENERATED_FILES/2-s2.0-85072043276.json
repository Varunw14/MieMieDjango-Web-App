We analysed the relationship between PI susceptibility and outcome of second-line ART in Nigeria, where subtypes CRF02-AG/G dominate the epidemic. Methods: Individuals who experienced second-line failure with ritonavir-boosted PI-based ART were matched (by subtype, sex, age, viral load, duration of treatment and baseline CD4 count) to those who achieved virological response ('successes'). Successes were defined by viral load <400 copies of HIV-1 RNA/mL by week 48. Full-length Gag-protease was amplified from patient samples for in vitro phenotypic susceptibility testing, with PI susceptibility expressed as IC50 fold change (FC) relative to a subtype B reference strain. Results: The median (IQR) lopinavir IC50 FC was 4.04 (2.49-7.89) for virological failures and 4.13 (3.14-8.17) for virological successes (P = 0.94). One patient had an FC >10 for lopinavir at baseline and experienced subsequent virological failure with ritonavir-boosted lopinavir as the PI. There was no statistically significant difference in single-round replication efficiency between the two groups (P = 0.93). There was a moderate correlation between single-round replication efficiency and FC for lopinavir (correlation coefficient 0.32). Conclusions: We found no impact of baseline HIV-1 Gag-protease-derived phenotypic susceptibility on outcomes of PI-based second-line ART in Nigeria.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "CD4 Lymphocyte Count", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Female", "HEK293 Cells", "HIV Infections", "HIV Protease", "HIV Protease Inhibitors", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Inhibitory Concentration 50", "Kidney", "Middle Aged", "Nigeria", "Phenotype", "Retrospective Studies", "Treatment Failure", "Treatment Outcome", "Viral Load"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072043276", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57210955285": {"Name": "Datir R.", "AuthorID": "57210955285", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, Cruciform Building UCL"}, "35558192400": {"Name": "El Bouzidi K.", "AuthorID": "35558192400", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, Cruciform Building UCL"}, "56848412000": {"Name": "Gupta R.K.", "AuthorID": "56848412000", "AffiliationID": "60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute"}, "35331903800": {"Name": "Dakum P.", "AuthorID": "35331903800", "AffiliationID": "60078170", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Human Virology"}, "56206346500": {"Name": "Ndembi N.", "AuthorID": "56206346500", "AffiliationID": "60078170", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Human Virology"}}}
