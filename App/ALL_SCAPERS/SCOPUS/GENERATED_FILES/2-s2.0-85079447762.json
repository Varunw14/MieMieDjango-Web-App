Despite its enormous potential as a model system, longer-term live imaging has been technically challenging because of a lack of efficient methods for immobilizing larvae for extended periods. We describe here a simple procedure for anesthetization and uninterrupted long-term in vivo imaging of the epidermis and other larval organs, including gut, imaginal discs, neurons, fat body, tracheae, muscles and hemocytes, for up to 8 h. We also include a procedure for probing cell properties by laser ablation. We provide a survey of the effects of different anesthetics, demonstrating that short exposure to diethyl ether is the most effective for long-term immobilization of larvae. This protocol does not require specific expertise beyond basic Drosophila genetics and husbandry, and confocal microscopy. It enables high-resolution studies of many systemic and subcellular processes in larvae.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Drosophila", "Ether", "Immobilization", "Larva", "Microscopy, Confocal", "Time Factors", "Video Recording"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079447762", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"55793072800": {"Name": "Kakanj P.", "AuthorID": "55793072800", "AffiliationID": "60024025", "AffiliationName": "Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases, University of Cologne"}, "7004672813": {"Name": "Leptin M.", "AuthorID": "7004672813", "AffiliationID": "60024025", "AffiliationName": "Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases, University of Cologne"}, "57202667589": {"Name": "Partridge L.", "AuthorID": "57202667589", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Healthy Ageing, Department of Genetics, Evolution, and Environment, University College London"}, "6603733275": {"Name": "Eming S.A.", "AuthorID": "6603733275", "AffiliationID": "60024025", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology, University of Cologne"}}}
