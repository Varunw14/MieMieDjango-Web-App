Axonal excitability techniques have been utilised to investigate the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying neurological diseases. This document presents guidelines derived for such studies, based on a consensus of international experts, and highlights the potential difficulties when interpreting abnormalities in diseased axons. The present manuscript provides a state-of-the-art review of the findings of axonal excitability studies and their interpretation, in addition to suggesting guidelines for the optimal performance of excitability studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Axon", "Excitability", "Guidelines", "Peripheral nerve", "Threshold"], "IndexKeywords": ["Action Potentials", "Axons", "Consensus", "Electric Stimulation", "Electrodes, Implanted", "Equipment Design", "Humans", "Ion Channels", "Membrane Potentials", "Models, Neurological", "Nervous System Diseases", "Neurophysiology", "Sensory Thresholds", "Software"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071322689", "SubjectAreas": [["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"57218539354": {"Name": "Kiernan M.C.", "AuthorID": "57218539354", "AffiliationID": "60018150, 60025709", "AffiliationName": "Brain and Mind Centre, University of Sydney and Institute of Clinical Neurosciences, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital"}, "23978576300": {"Name": "Park S.B.", "AuthorID": "23978576300", "AffiliationID": "60018150, 60025709", "AffiliationName": "Brain and Mind Centre, University of Sydney and Institute of Clinical Neurosciences, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital"}, "26031487000": {"Name": "Lin C.S.Y.", "AuthorID": "26031487000", "AffiliationID": "60018150, 60025709", "AffiliationName": "Brain and Mind Centre, University of Sydney and Institute of Clinical Neurosciences, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital"}, "7403247655": {"Name": "Burke D.", "AuthorID": "7403247655", "AffiliationID": "60018150, 60025709", "AffiliationName": "Brain and Mind Centre, University of Sydney and Institute of Clinical Neurosciences, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital"}, "7005459795": {"Name": "Bostock H.", "AuthorID": "7005459795", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "7102609882": {"Name": "Kaji R.", "AuthorID": "7102609882", "AffiliationID": "60019267", "AffiliationName": "National Utano Hospital"}, "26643072000": {"Name": "Krarup C.", "AuthorID": "26643072000", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, University of Copenhagen and Department of Clinical Neurophysiology"}, "7006835660": {"Name": "Moldovan M.", "AuthorID": "7006835660", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, University of Copenhagen and Department of Clinical Neurophysiology"}, "7102443559": {"Name": "Krishnan A.V.", "AuthorID": "7102443559", "AffiliationID": "60011463, 60028333", "AffiliationName": "Prince of Wales Clinical School, University of New South Wales"}, "57208559937": {"Name": "Kuwabara S.", "AuthorID": "57208559937", "AffiliationID": "60002787", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University"}, "7102005216": {"Name": "Misawa S.", "AuthorID": "7102005216", "AffiliationID": "60002787", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University"}, "7402626801": {"Name": "Sung J.", "AuthorID": "7402626801", "AffiliationID": "60022095", "AffiliationName": "Taipei Medical University, Wanfang Hospital"}, "6602790860": {"Name": "Vucic S.", "AuthorID": "6602790860", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60004437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Westmead Hospital, Western Clinical School, University of Sydney"}, "6507846903": {"Name": "Wainger B.J.", "AuthorID": "6507846903", "AffiliationID": "60029929", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Anesthesiology, Critical Care & Pain Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital"}, "35434000500": {"Name": "Waxman S.", "AuthorID": "35434000500", "AffiliationID": "60105857", "AffiliationName": "Neurorehabilitation Research Center, Veterans Affairs Hospital"}}}
