Many advances in diagnostic criteria have resulted in several revisions in the definition of this rare cancer type. Recent sequencing efforts have illuminated the nature of the genome complexity and have revealed extensive copy number heterogeneity and multiple evolutionary patterns of development. This review places these recent advances into their historical and translational context and covers the changes in nomenclature, molecular classification, and the promise of personalised medicine.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer", "Copy number signatures", "Evolution", "Genomics", "Sarcoma"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomarkers, Tumor", "Biopsy", "DNA Copy Number Variations", "Evolution, Molecular", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genomics", "Humans", "Immunohistochemistry", "Neoplasm Grading", "Neoplasm Staging", "Sarcoma", "Signal Transduction", "Translational Medical Research"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077153378", "SubjectAreas": [["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"57220656565": {"Name": "Steele C.D.", "AuthorID": "57220656565", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Pathology, Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "37361370300": {"Name": "Pillay N.", "AuthorID": "37361370300", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cellular and Molecular Pathology, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Trust"}}}
