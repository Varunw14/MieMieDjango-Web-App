While this transition is well established for stroboscopic measurements in random quantum circuits, a crucial link to physical settings is its extension to continuous observations, where for an integrable model it has been shown that the transition changes its nature and becomes immediate. Here, we demonstrate that the entanglement transition at finite coupling persists if the continuously measured system is randomly nonintegrable, and show that it is smoothly connected to the transition in the stroboscopic models. This provides a bridge between a wide range of experimental settings and the wealth of knowledge accumulated for the latter systems.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Continuous measurements", "Continuous observation", "Entanglement entropy", "Entanglement transition", "Integrable models", "Interacting quantum systems", "Quantum circuit", "Stroboscopic measurements"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85097173039", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55341206900": {"Name": "Szyniszewski M.", "AuthorID": "55341206900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "23006097100": {"Name": "Romito A.", "AuthorID": "23006097100", "AffiliationID": "60023643", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Lancaster University"}, "57196831306": {"Name": "Schomerus H.", "AuthorID": "57196831306", "AffiliationID": "60023643", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Lancaster University"}}}
