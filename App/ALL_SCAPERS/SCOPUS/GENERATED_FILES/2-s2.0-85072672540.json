Here, we use advanced first-principles methods, which include a magnetic entropy contribution, to investigate the magnetic and thermo-elastic properties of liquid Fe-S-Si and of pure liquid iron at the conditions of Mercury's core. Our results support a \u2018top-down\u2019 evolution of the core, whereby solid iron-rich material crystallises at shallow depths and sinks. This process would likely result in a compositionally driven dynamo within a stably stratified uppermost liquid layer, providing an explanation for the observed properties of the weak magnetic field of Mercury.", "AuthorKeywords": ["core evolution", "iron alloys", "Mercury", "planetary interiors", "planetary science", "top-down crystallization"], "IndexKeywords": ["core evolution", "Elastic properties", "First principles method", "Magnetic entropy", "Planetary interiors", "Planetary science", "Topdown", "Weak magnetic fields"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072672540", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57211112343": {"Name": "Edgington A.L.", "AuthorID": "57211112343", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College"}, "6603903752": {"Name": "Vo\u010dadlo L.", "AuthorID": "6603903752", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College"}, "7003403662": {"Name": "Stixrude L.", "AuthorID": "7003403662", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences, University of California"}, "7102583827": {"Name": "Wood I.G.", "AuthorID": "7102583827", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College"}, "7006319791": {"Name": "Dobson D.P.", "AuthorID": "7006319791", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College"}, "55987650400": {"Name": "Holmstr\u00f6m E.", "AuthorID": "55987650400", "AffiliationID": "60106157", "AffiliationName": "Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke), Production systems / Forest technology and logistics"}}}
