METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycInfo for articles published between January 1, 1988, and May 16, 2019. We included (1) all types of observational studies; (2) studies in which hemispherectomy was performed before age 18 years; and (3) studies with standardized scores measuring receptive vocabulary, expressive vocabulary, sentence comprehension, and/or sentence production. We calculated mean z scores after left and right hemispherectomy in the whole group and within etiology-specific subgroups. RESULTS: Our search identified 1,096 studies, of which 17 were eligible. The cohort added up to 205 individuals (62% left hemispherectomy) assessed 1 to 15 years after surgery. In the left surgery group, all language skills were impaired (z scores <-1.5) except sentence comprehension. In the right surgery group, language performance was in the borderline range (z scores \u223c -1.5). Children with cortical dysplasia showed the worst outcomes irrespective of surgery side (z scores <-2.5). Individuals with left vascular etiology and right-sided Rasmussen syndrome showed the best outcomes. CONCLUSION: Evidence based on the largest patient cohort to date (205 participants) suggests that the risk of language impairment after hemispherectomy is high, with few exceptions. Etiology plays a major role in postsurgical plasticity. We recommend specialist evaluation of language skills soon after surgery to identify intervention targets. Large-scale studies examining outcomes in consecutive cases are still needed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Brain Diseases", "Child", "Hemispherectomy", "Humans", "Language Disorders", "Outcome Assessment, Health Care"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85097579798", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57220765402": {"Name": "Nahum A.S.", "AuthorID": "57220765402", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": null}, "7003352056": {"Name": "Li\u00e9geois F.J.", "AuthorID": "7003352056", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": null}}}
