Pediatric RCC has different clinical characteristics, histopathology, and treatment compared with adult disease. Databases were reviewed from inception to February 2020, identifying 32 publications pertaining to 350 patients under 27 years. Surgery is the cornerstone for cure in localized RCC. Lymph node dissection remains controversial. Conventional radiotherapy has no curative role in RCC; similarly, conventional chemotherapy has not proven to be effective in large cohorts. Pediatric metastatic RCC has a poor outlook. There are no published prospective studies demonstrating which adjuvant therapy could improve outcome. Sunitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is recommended in this group despite limited evidence. This review provides an overview for pediatric RCC, including the evolving role of precision medicine.", "AuthorKeywords": ["pediatrics", "renal cell carcinoma", "targeted therapy", "treatment"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Carcinoma, Renal Cell", "Child", "Combined Modality Therapy", "Humans", "Kidney Neoplasms", "Prognosis", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089997981", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"57217586106": {"Name": "Ray S.", "AuthorID": "57217586106", "AffiliationID": "60190225", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Oncology, Royal Hospital for Children"}, "8588922200": {"Name": "Murphy D.", "AuthorID": "8588922200", "AffiliationID": "60190225", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Oncology, Royal Hospital for Children"}, "55547120726": {"Name": "Jones R.", "AuthorID": "55547120726", "AffiliationID": "60001490, 60000265", "AffiliationName": "Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow"}, "7005535741": {"Name": "Pritchard-Jones K.", "AuthorID": "7005535741", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Child Health"}, "57217489950": {"Name": "Dzhuma K.", "AuthorID": "57217489950", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Child Health"}, "6602159710": {"Name": "van den Heuvel-Eibrink M.", "AuthorID": "6602159710", "AffiliationID": "124142354", "AffiliationName": "Princess M\u00e1xima Center for Pediatric Oncology"}, "15077518000": {"Name": "Tytgat G.", "AuthorID": "15077518000", "AffiliationID": "124142354", "AffiliationName": "Princess M\u00e1xima Center for Pediatric Oncology"}, "57209852487": {"Name": "van der Beek J.", "AuthorID": "57209852487", "AffiliationID": "124142354", "AffiliationName": "Princess M\u00e1xima Center for Pediatric Oncology"}, "6602080551": {"Name": "Oades G.", "AuthorID": "6602080551", "AffiliationID": "60117212", "AffiliationName": "Department of Uro-Oncology, Queen Elizabeth University Hospital"}}}
