Published by BMJ.Background: In conflict-affected settings, women and girls are vulnerable to gender-based violence (GBV). GBV is associated with poor long-term mental health such as anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Understanding the interaction between current violence and past conflict-related violence with ongoing mental health is essential for improving mental health service provision in refugee camps. Methods: Using data collected from 209 women attending GBV case management centres in the Dadaab refugee camps, Kenya, we grouped women by recent experience of GBV using latent class analysis and modelled the relationship between the groups and symptomatic scores for anxiety, depression and PTSD using linear regression. Results: Women with past-year experience of intimate partner violence alone may have a higher risk of depression than women with past-year experience of non-partner violence alone (Coef. 1.68, 95% CI 0.25 to 3.11). Conflict-related violence was an important risk factor for poor mental health among women who accessed GBV services, despite time since occurrence (average time in camp was 11.5 years) and even for those with a past-year experience of GBV (Anxiety: 3.48, 1.85-5.10; Depression: 2.26, 0.51-4.02; PTSD: 6.83, 4.21-9.44). Conclusion: Refugee women who experienced past-year intimate partner violence or conflict-related violence may be at increased risk of depression, anxiety or PTSD. Service providers should be aware that compared to the general refugee population, women who have experienced violence may require additional psychological support and recognise the enduring impact of violence that occurred before, during and after periods of conflict and tailor outreach and treatment services accordingly.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Disaster relief", "Gender", "Health services", "Mental health", "Violence"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095791219", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57203734792": {"Name": "Hossain M.", "AuthorID": "57203734792", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Women, Peace & Security, London School of Economics and Political Science"}, "57192687655": {"Name": "McAlpine A.", "AuthorID": "57192687655", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health and Development, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "6603035967": {"Name": "Bacchus L.J.", "AuthorID": "6603035967", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health and Development, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57217183402": {"Name": "Pearson R.J.", "AuthorID": "57217183402", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice Research and Teaching Department, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "23095915300": {"Name": "Spangaro J.", "AuthorID": "23095915300", "AffiliationID": "60011664", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Society, University of Wollongong"}, "53983149500": {"Name": "Muthuri S.", "AuthorID": "53983149500", "AffiliationID": "60070562", "AffiliationName": "African Population and Health Research Center"}, "57202331061": {"Name": "Muuo S.", "AuthorID": "57202331061", "AffiliationID": "60070562", "AffiliationName": "African Population and Health Research Center"}, "26423490700": {"Name": "Bangha M.", "AuthorID": "26423490700", "AffiliationID": "60070562", "AffiliationName": "African Population and Health Research Center"}, "6507768025": {"Name": "Izugbara C.", "AuthorID": "6507768025", "AffiliationID": "60070562", "AffiliationName": "African Population and Health Research Center"}, "57219269014": {"Name": "Franchi G.", "AuthorID": "57219269014", "AffiliationID": "125184199", "AffiliationName": "Violence Prevention and Response Unit, International Rescue Committee UK"}, "57219271632": {"Name": "Hess T.", "AuthorID": "57219271632", "AffiliationID": "125184199", "AffiliationName": "Violence Prevention and Response Unit, International Rescue Committee UK"}}}
