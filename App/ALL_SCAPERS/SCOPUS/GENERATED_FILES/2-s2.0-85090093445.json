The size of the automaton model learned is a bottleneck for scalability, and hence optimizations that enable learning of compact representations are important. This paper exploits monads, both as a mathematical structure and a programming construct, to design and prove correct a wide class of such optimizations. Monads enable the development of a new learning algorithm and correctness proofs, building upon a general framework for automata learning based on category theory. The new algorithm is parametric on a monad, which provides a rich algebraic structure to capture non-determinism and other side-effects. We show that this allows us to uniformly capture existing algorithms, develop new ones, and add optimizations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Algebras", "Automata", "Learning", "Monads", "Side-effects"], "IndexKeywords": ["Algebraic structures", "Automaton model", "Compact representation", "Correctness proofs", "Hardware and software", "Learning Automata", "Mathematical structure", "Non Determinism"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090093445", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57195542360": {"Name": "van Heerdt G.", "AuthorID": "57195542360", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55770025200": {"Name": "Sammartino M.", "AuthorID": "55770025200", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Royal Holloway, University of London"}, "23398564400": {"Name": "Silva A.", "AuthorID": "23398564400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
