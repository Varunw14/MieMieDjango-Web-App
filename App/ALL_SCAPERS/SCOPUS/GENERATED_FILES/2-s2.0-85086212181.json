Based on extensive interview data from 2012-2016, the authors demonstrate that the fundamental ethos underpinning the school\u2019s improvement is a desire to meet the needs of young people in disadvantaged communities in order to equip them with the skills to allow them to transcend their situation. The authors posit that this school embodies the \u2018comprehensive ideal\u2019 of secondary education in England: that education should not be disadvantaged by background, and that the state should provide free and high quality education for all. This book will appeal to students and scholars of comprehensive education and schools in difficult contexts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Comprehensive", "Educational Leadership", "Ofsted", "Robert Clack school", "School improvement", "Secondary education", "Students"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086212181", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"6602662694": {"Name": "Male T.", "AuthorID": "6602662694", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}, "36089232800": {"Name": "Palaiologou I.", "AuthorID": "36089232800", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
