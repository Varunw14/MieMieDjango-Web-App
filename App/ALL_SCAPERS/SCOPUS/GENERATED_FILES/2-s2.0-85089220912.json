By formulating the optimization problem that aims to maximize the CI effect subject to the 1-bit constraint on the transmit signals, we mathematically prove that, when relaxing the 1-bit constraint, the majority of the obtained transmit signals already satisfy the 1-bit constraint. Based on this important observation, we propose a 1-bit precoding method via a partial branch-and-bound (P-BB) approach, where the BB procedure is only performed for the entries that do not comply with the 1-bit constraint. The proposed P-BB enables the use of the BB framework in large-scale antenna scenarios, which was not applicable due to its prohibitive complexity. Numerical results demonstrate a near-optimal error rate performance for the proposed 1-bit precoding algorithm.", "AuthorKeywords": ["1-bit precoding", "branch-and-bound", "constructive interference", "Lagrangian", "Massive MIMO"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antenna system", "Constructive interference", "Mimo precoding", "Near-optimal", "Numerical results", "Optimization problems", "Precoding"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089220912", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56453725100": {"Name": "Li A.", "AuthorID": "56453725100", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "University of Sydney, School of Electrical and Information Engineering"}, "57211818673": {"Name": "Liu F.", "AuthorID": "57211818673", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "University of Sydney, School of Electrical and Information Engineering"}, "57200273285": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "57200273285", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "University of Sydney, School of Electrical and Information Engineering"}, "7004279281": {"Name": "Vucetic B.", "AuthorID": "7004279281", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "University of Sydney, School of Electrical and Information Engineering"}, "23009493900": {"Name": "Masouros C.", "AuthorID": "23009493900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}}}
