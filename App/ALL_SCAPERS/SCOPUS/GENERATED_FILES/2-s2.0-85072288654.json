A complex interaction of biomechanical factors contribute to NIH development and progression, and although haemodynamic markers such as wall shear stress have been linked to the disease, these have so far been insufficient to fully capture its behaviour. Using a computational model linking computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of blood flow with a biochemical model representing NIH growth mechanisms, we analyse the effect of compliance mismatch, due to the presence of surgical stitches and/or to the change in distensibility between artery and vein graft, on the haemodynamics in the lumen and, subsequently, on NIH progression. The model enabled to simulate NIH at proximal and distal anastomoses of three patient-specific end-to-side saphenous vein grafts under two compliance-mismatch configurations, and a rigid wall case for comparison, obtaining values of stenosis similar to those observed in the computed tomography (CT) scans. The maximum difference in time-averaged wall shear stress between the rigid and compliant models was 3.4 Pa, and differences in estimation of NIH progression were only observed in one patient. The impact of compliance on the haemodynamic-driven development of NIH was small in the patient-specific cases considered.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Compliance mismatch", "Computational fluid dynamics", "Moving boundary method", "Multi-scale modelling", "Neointimal hyperplasia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomechanical factors", "Compliance mismatch", "Computational fluid dynamics simulations", "Computed tomography scan", "Moving boundary methods", "Multi-scale modelling", "Neointimal hyperplasia", "Peripheral arteries", "Arteries", "Blood Vessel Prosthesis", "Computer Simulation", "Disease Progression", "Hemodynamics", "Humans", "Hydrodynamics", "Hyperplasia", "Neointima", "Patient-Specific Modeling", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072288654", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"57194111229": {"Name": "Donadoni F.", "AuthorID": "57194111229", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "56814624000": {"Name": "Bonfanti M.", "AuthorID": "56814624000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences (WEISS), Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "8241424500": {"Name": "Pichardo-Almarza C.", "AuthorID": "8241424500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "56266099800": {"Name": "Homer-Vanniasinkam S.", "AuthorID": "56266099800", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery, University of Warwick"}, "23984658900": {"Name": "D\u00edaz-Zuccarini V.", "AuthorID": "23984658900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences (WEISS), Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003537020": {"Name": "Dardik A.", "AuthorID": "7003537020", "AffiliationID": "60105857", "AffiliationName": "Veteran Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System"}}}
