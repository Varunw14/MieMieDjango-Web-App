We evaluated weight changes in virologically suppressed adults with HIV who switched from non-INSTI regimens to raltegravir (RAL)-containing or dolutegravir (DTG)-containing antiretroviral therapy.Design:Retrospective single-centre cohort.Methods:Adults who switched to RAL or DTG before or between January 2015 and October 2017 were identified. Virologically suppressed, treatment-experienced (\u22652 years) individuals, at least 6 months on INSTI, with weight measurements 2 years or less pre and postswitch were included. Our analysis used a random effects model with linear slope pre and post-INSTI with adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, preswitch-regimen (protease inhibitor vs. nonprotease inhibitor), and RAL vs. DTG use.Results:A total of 378 individuals, 81.2% male, 70.1% white ethnicity, median age of 49 years, median of four weight measurements per participant, and median weight and BMI at switch of 76.6kg and 25.3kg/m2, respectively, were included. Weight increased by an average of 0.63kg/year (95% confidence interval 0.17-1.09) preswitch with no overall change in rate of weight gain postswitch [+0.05kg/year (-0.61-0.71, P=0.88)]. In our adjusted model, a transition from minimal weight change to weight gain postswitch was isolated to older individuals though this lacked statistical significance [e.g., +1.59kg/year (-0.26-3.45) if aged 65 years]. Our findings did not differ by sex, ethnicity, preswitch regimen, or RAL vs. DTG. Similar results were seen for BMI and after adjusting for fixed nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone.Conclusion:We found no clear evidence of an overall increase in rate of weight gain following switch to INSTI in virologically suppressed individuals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["antiretroviral therapy", "drug switch", "integrase inhibitors", "weight gain"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Drug Substitution", "Female", "Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring", "HIV Infections", "HIV Integrase Inhibitors", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Oxazines", "Piperazines", "Pyridones", "Raltegravir Potassium", "Retrospective Studies", "Sustained Virologic Response", "Treatment Outcome", "Weight Gain", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075961313", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57217520086": {"Name": "Burns J.E.", "AuthorID": "57217520086", "AffiliationID": "60162114, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "56333656200": {"Name": "Stirrup O.T.", "AuthorID": "56333656200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Research in Infection and Sexual Health, Institute for Global Health, University College London, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "57219085369": {"Name": "Dunn D.", "AuthorID": "57219085369", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology, University College London"}, "57212113565": {"Name": "Runcie-Unger I.", "AuthorID": "57212113565", "AffiliationID": "60162114, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "35435836900": {"Name": "Milinkovic A.", "AuthorID": "35435836900", "AffiliationID": "60032993", "AffiliationName": "Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57212115190": {"Name": "Lukha H.", "AuthorID": "57212115190", "AffiliationID": "60162114, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "57212112731": {"Name": "Severn A.", "AuthorID": "57212112731", "AffiliationID": "60162114, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "57209757944": {"Name": "Gilson R.", "AuthorID": "57209757944", "AffiliationID": "60162114, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "7004714193": {"Name": "Pett S.L.", "AuthorID": "7004714193", "AffiliationID": "60026655, 60028333", "AffiliationName": "Kirby Institute, University of New South Wales"}, "55839318700": {"Name": "Candfield S.", "AuthorID": "55839318700", "AffiliationID": "60162114, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "10140967500": {"Name": "Waters L.", "AuthorID": "10140967500", "AffiliationID": "60162114, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "56601072600": {"Name": "Edwards S.", "AuthorID": "56601072600", "AffiliationID": "60162114, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust, Mortimer Market Centre"}}}
