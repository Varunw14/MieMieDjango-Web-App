Sentence \u201cTwenty-five patients in the AP group suffered treatment emergent infections with 23 fully recovering, one recovered with sequelae, and one died (sepsis), compared with\u2026\u201d should read \u201cTwenty-five treatment-emergent infections occurred in the AP group, of which 23 fully resolved, one resolved with sequelae and one was fatal (sepsis), compared with \u2026\u201db. The corresponding section \u201cSummaries of acute kidney injury and infectious events, Infection\u201d of Table 3 reports the correct numbers of infectious events (25 in the alfapump [AP] group, 30 in the Standard of Care [SoC] group) but incorrect values for \u201cEvents per patient, mean\u201d and p value. Correct values should be \u201cEvents per patient, mean\u201d, AP = 0.93 and SoC = 0.97 and p value = 0.883. This error appeared to occur at the editorial stage.2) Results \u2013 Subheading \u201cCirculatory dysfunction\u201d \u2013 \u201cAcute kidney injury\u201d and Table 3 a. Sentence \u201cExcept for three patients with hematuria and urethral stenosis, the others were due to AKI.\u201d should read \u201cExcept for three patients with hematuria and one with urethral stenosis, the others were due to AKI.\u201db. Other than reported in the publication, 11 and not only 10 patients fully recovered from the AKI events they suffered (Sequana, data on file). Therefore, the corresponding sentence in the main text body should read: \u201cJust over 41% of these AEs in the AP group (12/29) occurred in the first seven days after implant and were transient, and of those 11/12 fully recovered and 1/12 improved.\u201dc. One event of chronic renal failure in one patient in the AP group that occurred on Day 7 had been erroneously assigned to the total count of AKI events during the analysis, which was noticed before publication. The mistake was corrected in the manuscript text, but not in the corresponding section in Table 3. The total event count in Table 3, section \u201cSummaries of acute kidney injury and infectious events, AKI All\u201d should be 29 in the AP group, not 30. Corresponding mean events per patient and p values only changed in the third and fourth digit, respectively, and remain as published. For clarity, the footnote of Table 3 should be edited to read \u201c\u2020acute kidney injury or renal insufficiency or hepatorenal syndrome (excluding chronic renal failure) analyzed by t test for equality of means.\u201dd. One event in the AP group that occurred from 6\u201312 months was incorrectly added to the count of post-Day 7 AKI events, while the paper was meant to present data up to 6 months only. Another event of renal impairment that occurred in the AP group up to 6 months was inappropriately not included. In addition, the event excluded and the event newly included had different outcomes (the excluded event was unchanged or worsened, while the event newly included improved). This does not affect any numbers in Table 3, however, in Table S6, Section \u201cAE (all post-Day 0), AP\u201d, line \u201cTotal\u201d changes to 29 total events, 25 improved, 4 unchanged or worsened and line \u201cOther\u201d changes to 10 total events, 9 improved and 1 unchanged or worsened. Furthermore, Table S6, Section \u201cAE (>7 days post-Day 0), AP\u201d, Line \u201cTotal\u201d changes to 17 total events, 13 improved, 4 unchanged or worsened and line \u201cOther\u201d changes to 7 total events, 6 improved and 1 unchanged or worsened.e. One event of AKI that occurred on Day 7 in a patient in the SoC group was incorrectly assigned to the count of post-Day 7 AKI events. The corresponding counts in the \u201cSummaries of acute kidney injury and infectious events, AKI >7 days post-implant\u201d section of Table 3 should be 17 in the AP group vs. 10, not 11, in the SoC group. Consequently, the mean events per patient become 0.32 in the SoC group. The p value changes to 0.227.f. Accordingly, the main text under the subheading \u201cAcute kidney injury\u201d requires correction to \u201cIf the first seven post-operative days are excluded, there were similar numbers in each group (17 vs. 10, respectively; p = 0.227, Table 3)\u201d.g. Accordingly, in Table S6, Section \u201cAdverse events (>7 days post-Day 0), SoC\u201d, line \u201cTotal\u201d changes to 10 total events, 7 improved, 3 unchanged or worsened, and line \u201cAKI \u2013 Stage 1\u201d changes to 4 total events, 4 improved, 0 unchanged or worsened.The relevant part of Table 3 is presented below, with the correct (amended) values and footnote underlined: [Table presented] The corrected Table S6 is presented below, with the correct (amended) values underlined. [Table presented] Notably, all conclusions on overall statistical significance of the presented findings remain unaffected by these corrections.
