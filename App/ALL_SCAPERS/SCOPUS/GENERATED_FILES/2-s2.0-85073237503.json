In this work, nanoparticles of NiO and gadolinia-doped ceria (CGO) approximately 10 nm in diameter fabricated using a continuous hydrothermal flow synthesis are made into nano-structured SOC fuel electrodes via mixing and co-sintering. Both the Ni and CGO are of 50-100 nm in diameter in the final electrode. FIB-SEM 3-D tomography is carried out on the nanoscale Ni-CGO electrode which has been aged for 70 h, showing a high active triple phase boundary density of 3 \u00b5m-2 and a high active double phase boundary density of 2 \u00b5m-1. The total polarisation resistance of the electrode is stable at 0.20 \u03a9 cm2 under open circuit conditions at 800 \u00b0C annealing in humidified 5% H2-N2.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["3-d tomographies", "Continuous hydrothermal flow synthesis", "Electrochemical performance", "Gadolinia doped ceria", "Nano-composite powders", "Open circuit conditions", "Polarisation resistances", "Triple phase boundary"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073237503", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"57195495929": {"Name": "Chen J.", "AuthorID": "57195495929", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Imperial College London"}, "55865183700": {"Name": "Liu X.", "AuthorID": "55865183700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Dyson School of Design, Imperial College London"}, "57195495528": {"Name": "Ouyang M.", "AuthorID": "57195495528", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "13806954100": {"Name": "Boldrin P.", "AuthorID": "13806954100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "7005362989": {"Name": "Brandon N.", "AuthorID": "7005362989", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "6603926697": {"Name": "Darr J.", "AuthorID": "6603926697", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7202164426": {"Name": "Atkinson A.", "AuthorID": "7202164426", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Imperial College London"}}}
