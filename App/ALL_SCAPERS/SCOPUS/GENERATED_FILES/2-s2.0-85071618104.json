Their effect in promoting uptake and adherence in pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has not been tested. PR is the most effective treatment for the symptoms and disability of COPD, but this effectiveness is undermined by poor rates of completion. Trained LHWs with COPD, who also have first-hand experience of PR, are well placed to help overcome the documented barriers to its completion. The relationship between LHWs and patients may be one of the keys to their effectiveness but it has been little explored. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were used with the aim of examining the LHW-patient partnership in a feasibility study of trained PR-experienced LHWs used to support COPD patients referred to PR. Twelve volunteers with COPD who completed LHW training supported 66 patients referred for PR. All 12 of these LHWs gave end-of-study interviews, 21 COPD patients supported by LHWs were also interviewed. Patients reported that the LHWs were keen to share their experiences of PR, and that this had a positive impact. The enthusiasm of the LHWs for PR was striking. The common bond between LHWs and patients of having COPD together with the LHWs positive, first-hand experience of PR were dominant and recurring themes in their relationship.", "AuthorKeywords": ["COPD", "Lay health workers", "patient navigators", "pulmonary rehabilitation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Health Personnel", "Humans", "Interpersonal Relations", "Interviews as Topic", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Patient Compliance", "Peer Group", "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive", "Qualitative Research", "Volunteers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071618104", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"57219457041": {"Name": "Gilworth G.", "AuthorID": "57219457041", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health and Primary Care, School of Population Health and Environmental Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "35587016600": {"Name": "White P.", "AuthorID": "35587016600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health and Primary Care, School of Population Health and Environmental Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "56875855400": {"Name": "Lewin S.", "AuthorID": "56875855400", "AffiliationID": "60028973", "AffiliationName": "Health Systems Research Unit, South African Medical Research Council"}, "13610695300": {"Name": "Wright A.J.", "AuthorID": "13610695300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Behaviour Change, Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "7404756587": {"Name": "Taylor S.J.C.", "AuthorID": "7404756587", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Bart\u2019s and London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "56728763800": {"Name": "Tuffnell R.", "AuthorID": "56728763800", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "The Pulmonary Rehabilitation and Integrated Respiratory Team, King\u2019s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36993010400": {"Name": "Hogg L.", "AuthorID": "36993010400", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Physiotherapy Department, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56253653200": {"Name": "Hopkinson N.S.", "AuthorID": "56253653200", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "7407869482": {"Name": "Singh S.J.", "AuthorID": "7407869482", "AffiliationID": "60028485", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Exercise and Rehabilitation Science, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust"}}}
