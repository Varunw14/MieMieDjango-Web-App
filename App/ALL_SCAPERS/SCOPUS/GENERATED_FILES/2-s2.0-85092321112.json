Or better still, following the words of Elisabeth Grosz, is there space for an \u201contoethics\u201d of the urban? While contributing to the reflection on the role of ethics as a relational practice, this paper is digging back into the notion of forms-of-life in Giorgio Agamben\u2019s political reflections, aiming to foreground a possible ethics of the city. This aims to highlight the implications that ontology and ethics have in constructing a politics of life as they bring differences in how we live, act, what we value and how we produce and design. Particularly, to substantiate such ethics, three key characteristics of an affirmative life are put forward: the capacity to care and to connect; the capacity to repair, endure and hold together; as well as to imagine and experiment alternative life-forces to oppose politics of oppression and capitalist extraction of values.", "AuthorKeywords": ["collective life", "ethics", "forms-of-life", "ontology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092321112", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Architecture", "ENGI", "2216"], ["Visual Arts and Performing Arts", "ARTS", "1213"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"34874608400": {"Name": "Boano C.", "AuthorID": "34874608400", "AffiliationID": "60012162", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento Interateneo di Scienze, Progetto e Politiche del Territorio"}}}
