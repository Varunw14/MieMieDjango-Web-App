In most people, the repeat length is 2, but in people with ALS, hundreds to thousands of repeats may be observed. A small proportion of people have an intermediate expansion, of the order of 20 to 30 repeats in size, and it remains unknown whether intermediate expansions confer risk of ALS in the same way that massive expansions do. We investigated the association of this intermediate repeat with ALS by performing a meta-analysis of four previously published studies and a new British/Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset of 1295 cases and 613 controls. The final dataset comprised 5071 cases and 3747 controls. Our meta-analysis showed association between ALS and intermediate C9orf72 repeats of 24 to 30 repeats in size (random-effects model OR = 4.2, 95% CI = 1.23-14.35, p-value = 0.02). Furthermore, we showed a different frequency of the repeat between the northern and southern European populations (Fisher's exact test p-value = 5 \u00d7 10- 3). Our findings provide evidence for the association between intermediate repeats and ALS (p-value = 2 \u00d7 10- 4) with direct relevance for research and clinical practice by showing that an expansion of 24 or more repeats should be considered pathogenic.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ALS", "C9orf72", "Genetics", "Next-generation sequencing", "Repeat expansion", "Whole-genome sequencing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "C9orf72 Protein", "Databases, Genetic", "DNA Repeat Expansion", "European Continental Ancestry Group", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Whole Genome Sequencing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081991233", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"57200614669": {"Name": "Iacoangeli A.", "AuthorID": "57200614669", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, King's College London, Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute"}, "8931612400": {"Name": "Dobson R.J.", "AuthorID": "8931612400", "AffiliationID": "60028884, 60011520, 60171762", "AffiliationName": null}, "8931613700": {"Name": "Newhouse S.J.", "AuthorID": "8931613700", "AffiliationID": "60028884, 60011520, 60171762", "AffiliationName": null}, "57192832172": {"Name": "Al Khleifat A.", "AuthorID": "57192832172", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, King's College London, Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute"}, "55245748600": {"Name": "Jones A.R.", "AuthorID": "55245748600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, King's College London, Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute"}, "37113019000": {"Name": "Sproviero W.", "AuthorID": "37113019000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, King's College London, Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute"}, "55632439300": {"Name": "Shatunov A.", "AuthorID": "55632439300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, King's College London, Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute"}, "57204045986": {"Name": "Opie-Martin S.", "AuthorID": "57204045986", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, King's College London, Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute"}, "35370282000": {"Name": "Shaw C.E.", "AuthorID": "35370282000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute, King's College London"}, "57209496789": {"Name": "Fogh I.", "AuthorID": "57209496789", "AffiliationID": "60006646", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Laboratory of Neuroscience, IRCCS Istituto Auxologico Italiano"}, "57213315345": {"Name": "Al-Chalabi A.", "AuthorID": "57213315345", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "King's College Hospital"}, "57188987558": {"Name": "Morrison K.E.", "AuthorID": "57188987558", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60025225, 60000703", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, University Hospital Southampton"}, "57213315386": {"Name": "Shaw P.J.", "AuthorID": "57213315386", "AffiliationID": "60008750, 60001881", "AffiliationName": "Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience, University of Sheffield"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
