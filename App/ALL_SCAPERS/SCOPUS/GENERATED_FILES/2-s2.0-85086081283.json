The OEO's frequency is tuned by varying the bandwidth of a tunable optical bandpass filter (TOBF) that is cascaded with a phase modulator (PM). The resulting tunable microwave photonic filter is used to generate OEO oscillations from 6.58 GHz up to 18.36 GHz (with a phase noise of \u2264-103 dBc/Hz at 10 kHz offset from the carrier frequency). The OEO is subsequently used to drive an optical comb, generating 22 comb lines with a frequency spacing of 17.33 GHz covering a bandwidth of 360 GHz within a 20 dB envelope. By selecting two optical comb lines with a wavelength selective switch (WSS) and beating them in a uni-traveling carrier photodiode (UTC-PD), THz signals are generated at 101.5 GHz and 242.6 GHz with phase noise of -90 dBc/Hz and -78 dBc/Hz, respectively at 10 kHz offset from carrier frequency. Tunable mm-wave and THz signals can be generated either by changing the OEO oscillation frequency or the selected comb lines. Using the OEO driven OFCG, we implemented a RoF link at 242.6 GHz with a data rate of 24 Gbps over a wireless distance of 30 cm and with a bit error rate (BER) below the hard decision forward error correction (FEC) limit of 3.8 \u00d7 10-3. This method allows the creation of an all-photonic frequency reconfigurable THz signal generator and RoF system.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Allan deviation", "infinite impulse response", "microwave photonics", "optoelectronic oscillator", "side mode suppression"], "IndexKeywords": ["Optical bandpass filters", "Optical frequency combs", "Opto-electronic oscillator", "Oscillation frequency", "Radio-over-Fiber (RoF)", "Tunable optoelectronic oscillator (OEO)", "Uni-traveling-carrier photodiodes", "Wavelength-selective switches"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086081283", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"56415113600": {"Name": "Hasanuzzaman G.K.M.", "AuthorID": "56415113600", "AffiliationID": "60071343", "AffiliationName": "Microwave Photonics Research Laboratory, Emphasis Research Centre, University of Cyprus"}, "57191495040": {"Name": "Iezekiel S.", "AuthorID": "57191495040", "AffiliationID": "60071343", "AffiliationName": "Microwave Photonics Research Laboratory, Emphasis Research Centre, University of Cyprus"}, "55600338800": {"Name": "Shams H.", "AuthorID": "55600338800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006454070": {"Name": "Renaud C.C.", "AuthorID": "7006454070", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56937482600": {"Name": "Mitchell J.", "AuthorID": "56937482600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004751445": {"Name": "Seeds A.J.", "AuthorID": "7004751445", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
