All rights reserved.Background and Purpose - Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) hyperintensities in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) are associated with increased risk of recurrent ICH, cognitive impairment, and death, but whether these lesions are specific to a subtype of ICH remains uncertain. We investigated the association between DWI lesions and ICH subtype and explored the risk factors for DWI lesions. Methods - In a systematic review of ICH studies, we identified those reporting prevalence of DWI lesions. Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias and collected data. We determined the pooled prevalence of DWI lesions within 90 days after ICH onset for cerebral amyloid angiopathy- and hypertensive angiopathy-related ICH using random-effects meta-analysis. We calculated odds ratios to compare prevalence of DWI lesions by ICH subtype and to assess risk factors for DWI lesions. Results - Eleven studies (1910 patients) were included. The pooled prevalence of DWI lesions was 18.9% (95% CI, 11.1-26.7) in cerebral amyloid angiopathy- and 21.0% (95% CI, 15.3-26.6) in hypertensive angiopathy-related ICH. There was no difference in the prevalence of DWI lesions between cerebral amyloid angiopathy- (64/292 [21.9%]) and hypertensive angiopathy-related ICH (79/370 [21.4%]; odds ratio, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.73-2.15) in the 5 studies reporting data on both ICH pathogeneses. In all ICH, presence of DWI lesions was associated with neuroimaging features of microangiopathy (leukoaraiosis extension, previous ICH, and presence, and number of microbleeds) but not with vascular risk factors or the use of antithrombotic therapies. Conclusions - Prevalence of DWI lesions in acute ICH averages 20%, with no difference between cerebral amyloid angiopathy- and hypertensive angiopathy-related ICH. Detection of DWI lesions may add valuable information to assess the progression of the underlying microangiopathy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cerebral amyloid angiopathy", "cerebral hemorrhage", "cerebral infarction", "leukoaraiosis", "prevalence"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073623173", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Advanced and Specialized Nursing", "NURS", "2902"]], "AuthorData": {"56884139900": {"Name": "Boulanger M.", "AuthorID": "56884139900", "AffiliationID": "60033036", "AffiliationName": "CHU C\u00f4te de Nacre, Neurology Department, Service de Neurologie"}, "7201949499": {"Name": "Zuber M.", "AuthorID": "7201949499", "AffiliationID": "60072150, 60123796", "AffiliationName": "Neurology Department, H\u00f4pital Saint Joseph, Universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes"}, "12765672900": {"Name": "Touz\u00e9 E.", "AuthorID": "12765672900", "AffiliationID": "60033036", "AffiliationName": "CHU C\u00f4te de Nacre, Neurology Department, Service de Neurologie"}, "57215192135": {"Name": "Schneckenburger R.", "AuthorID": "57215192135", "AffiliationID": "60033036", "AffiliationName": "CHU C\u00f4te de Nacre, Neurology Department, Service de Neurologie"}, "36614289000": {"Name": "Join-Lambert C.", "AuthorID": "36614289000", "AffiliationID": "60072150, 60123796", "AffiliationName": "Neurology Department, H\u00f4pital Saint Joseph, Universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes"}, "6603707621": {"Name": "Werring D.J.", "AuthorID": "6603707621", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, Stroke Research Centre, Institute of Neurology"}, "57202955229": {"Name": "Wilson D.", "AuthorID": "57202955229", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, Stroke Research Centre, Institute of Neurology"}, "24479308400": {"Name": "Hodel J.", "AuthorID": "24479308400", "AffiliationID": "60023970, 60025066", "AffiliationName": "Neuroradiology Department, H\u00f4pital Henri Mondor, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Est Cr\u00e9teil"}}}
