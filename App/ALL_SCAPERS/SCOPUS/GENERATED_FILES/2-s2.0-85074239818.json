CMT is usually characterized by distal muscle atrophy, often with foot deformity, weakness and sensory loss. In the past decade, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized genomic medicine and, as these technologies are being applied to clinical practice, they are changing our diagnostic approach to CMT. In this Review, we discuss the application of NGS technologies, including disease-specific gene panels, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome sequencing (WGS), mitochondrial sequencing and high-throughput transcriptome sequencing, to the diagnosis of CMT. We discuss the growing challenge of variant interpretation and consider how the clinical phenotype can be combined with genetic, bioinformatic and functional evidence to assess the pathogenicity of genetic variants in patients with CMT. WGS has several advantages over the other techniques that we discuss, which include unparalleled coverage of coding, non-coding and intergenic areas of both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, the ability to identify structural variants and the opportunity to perform genome-wide dense homozygosity mapping. We propose an algorithm for incorporating WGS into the CMT diagnostic pathway.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease", "Genetic Testing", "Genetic Variation", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074239818", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"55960397100": {"Name": "Pipis M.", "AuthorID": "55960397100", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, Department of Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "57218107544": {"Name": "Rossor A.M.", "AuthorID": "57218107544", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, Department of Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "22951097700": {"Name": "Laura M.", "AuthorID": "22951097700", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, Department of Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "57203175311": {"Name": "Reilly M.M.", "AuthorID": "57203175311", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, Department of Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}}}
