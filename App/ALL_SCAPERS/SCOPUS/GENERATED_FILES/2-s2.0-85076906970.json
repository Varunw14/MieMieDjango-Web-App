Pediatric Obesity published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of World Obesity FederationBackground: In many high-income countries, body mass index (BMI)/obesity levels are inversely associated with socio-economic position (SEP). Little is known whether socio-economic patterns in BMI trajectories throughout childhood differ by ethnicity, especially in the United Kingdom. Objectives: To investigate socio-economic disparities in child-to-adolescent BMI trajectories and risks of overweight and obesity during adolescence across ethnic groups. Methods: Mixed-effects fractional polynomial and multinomial regression models were applied to estimate socio-economic differences in BMI trajectories (3-14 years) and risk of overweight/obesity at 14 years, respectively, in the UK Millennium Cohort Study (n = 15 996). Analysis was stratified by ethnicity. Result: Poverty was associated with higher BMI in children of White and South Asian origins, with a small difference at 3 years, which widened with age to 0.75 kg/m2 (95% CI, 0.59-0.91) and 0.77 kg/m2 (0.26-1.27) at 14 years for the White and South Asian groups, respectively. There was a reverse income-BMI association in children of Black (African-Caribbean) origin with the poverty group having a lower BMI (\u22120.37 kg/m2 [\u22120.71 to -0.04] at 5 years; \u22120.95 kg/m2 [\u22121.79 to \u22120.11] at 14 years). These patterns also presented with maternal education as a SEP indicator and for obesity at 14 years. Conclusions: Socio-economic advantage may not be universally associated with lower BMI, which should be considered when planning obesity interventions. The positive SEP-BMI association in children of Black origin requires replication and merits further investigation into underpinning mechanisms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BMI", "childhood", "ethnicity", "socio-economic", "United Kingdom"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Body Mass Index", "Child", "Female", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Overweight", "Pediatric Obesity", "Poverty", "Prospective Studies", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076906970", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57212506574": {"Name": "Lu Y.", "AuthorID": "57212506574", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "55605020600": {"Name": "Li L.", "AuthorID": "55605020600", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "23397901800": {"Name": "Pearce A.", "AuthorID": "23397901800", "AffiliationID": "60001490, 60005028", "AffiliationName": "MRC/CSO Social and Public Health Sciences Unit, University of Glasgow"}}}
