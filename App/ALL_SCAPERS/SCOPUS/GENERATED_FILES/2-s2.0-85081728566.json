Published under the terms of the CC BY 4.0 licenseSepsis has been identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a global health priority. There has been a tremendous effort to decipher underlying mechanisms responsible for organ failure and death, and to develop new treatments. Despite saving thousands of animals over the last three decades in multiple preclinical studies, no new effective drug has emerged that has clearly improved patient outcomes. In the present review, we analyze the reasons for this failure, focusing on the inclusion of inappropriate patients and the use of irrelevant animal models. We advocate against repeating the same mistakes and propose changes to the research paradigm. We discuss the long-term consequences of surviving sepsis and, finally, list some putative approaches\u2014both old and new\u2014that could help save lives and improve survivorship.", "AuthorKeywords": ["animal models", "cytokine storm", "personalized medicine", "reprogramming", "sepsis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081728566", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"]], "AuthorData": {"7005084804": {"Name": "Cavaillon J.M.", "AuthorID": "7005084804", "AffiliationID": "60001772", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Neuropathology Unit, Institut Pasteur"}, "7401654716": {"Name": "Singer M.", "AuthorID": "7401654716", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bloomsbury Institute of Intensive Care Medicine, University College London"}, "26641474700": {"Name": "Skirecki T.", "AuthorID": "26641474700", "AffiliationID": "60084597", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Flow Cytometry and Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Centre of Postgraduate Medical Education"}}}
