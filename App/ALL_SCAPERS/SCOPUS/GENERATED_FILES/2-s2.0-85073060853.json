The net modal gain and the absorption in the modulator were measured using the segmented contact method from 25 \u00b0C to 125 \u00b0C. The maximum of the net modal gain active region of the laser decreases from 10 cm-1 at 25 \u00b0C to 3.9 cm-1 at 125 \u00b0C. The non-optimized maximum extinction ratio of the modulator, 4.1 dB\u00b7mm-1, is almost constant until 25 \u00b0C. The wavelengths at which the net modal gain and the change in absorption are maximum shifts with temperature by 0.04 eV.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Active regions", "Electroabsorption modulation", "InAs/GaAs", "Maximum extinction ratios", "Modal gain", "Monolithically integrated", "Segmented contact method", "Temperature dependent behavior"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073060853", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"]], "AuthorData": {"37047422300": {"Name": "Le Boulbar E.", "AuthorID": "37047422300", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, Cardiff University"}, "57205030422": {"Name": "Jarvis L.", "AuthorID": "57205030422", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, Cardiff University"}, "57213765117": {"Name": "Hayes D.", "AuthorID": "57213765117", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, Cardiff University"}, "35194710600": {"Name": "Shutts S.", "AuthorID": "35194710600", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, Cardiff University"}, "57206872946": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "57206872946", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, Cardiff University"}, "55365959800": {"Name": "Tang M.", "AuthorID": "55365959800", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, Cardiff University"}, "57212370367": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "57212370367", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, Cardiff University"}, "56308830800": {"Name": "Samani A.", "AuthorID": "56308830800", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, Cardiff University"}, "7005402256": {"Name": "Smowton P.", "AuthorID": "7005402256", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, Cardiff University"}, "56108240300": {"Name": "Abadia N.", "AuthorID": "56108240300", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, Cardiff University"}}}
