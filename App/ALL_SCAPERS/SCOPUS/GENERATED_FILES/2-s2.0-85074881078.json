Among these groups, PH Group-III is defined as PH due to lung disease or hypoxia. Prostacyclin (PGI2) analogues (iloprost, treprostinil) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) receptor antagonists (ERA) (used alone or in combination) are therapies used for treating PH. The mechanisms underlying the positive/negative effects of combination treatment are not well documented, and in this study, we tested the hypothesis that the combination of a PGI2 analogue (iloprost, treprostinil) and an ERA may be more effective than either drug alone to treat vasculopathies observed in PH Group-III patients. Using Western blotting, ETA and ETB receptor expression were determined in human pulmonary artery (HPA) preparations derived from control and PH Group-III patients, and the physiologic impact of altered expression ratios was assessed by measuring ET-1 induced contraction of ex vivo HPA and human pulmonary veins (HPV) in an isolated organ bath system. In addition, the effects of single agent or combination treatments with a PGI2 analogue and an ERA on ET-1 release and HPA smooth muscle cells (hPASMCs) proliferation were determined by ELISA and MTT techniques, respectively. Our results indicate that the increased ETA/ETB receptor expression ratio in HPA derived from PH Group-III patients is primarily governed by a greatly depressed ETB receptor expression. However, contractions induced by ET-1 are not impacted in HPA and HPV derived from PH Group-III patients as compared to controls. Also, we found that the combination of an ETA receptor antagonist (BQ123) with iloprost provides greater inhibition of hPASMCs proliferation (-48\u00b114% control; -32\u00b106% PH) than either agent alone. Of note, while the ETB receptor antagonist (BQ788) increases ET-1 production from PH Group-III patients\u2019 preparations (HPA, parenchyma), even under these more proliferative conditions, iloprost and treprostinil are still effective to inhibit hPASMCs proliferation (-22/-24%). Our findings may provide new insights for the treatment of PH Group-III by combining a PGI2 analogue and a selective ETA receptor antagonist.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Endothelin receptor antagonist", "Human pulmonary artery", "PGI2ET-1", "Pulmonary hypertension"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Endothelin-1", "Epoprostenol", "Female", "Humans", "Hypertension, Pulmonary", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Muscle, Smooth, Vascular", "Pulmonary Artery", "Pulmonary Veins", "Receptor, Endothelin A", "Receptor, Endothelin B", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074881078", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"55775632600": {"Name": "Ozen G.", "AuthorID": "55775632600", "AffiliationID": "60028502", "AffiliationName": "Istanbul University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmacology"}, "54896353900": {"Name": "Benyahia C.", "AuthorID": "54896353900", "AffiliationID": "60009647", "AffiliationName": "Paris 13 University"}, "57190069028": {"Name": "Amgoud Y.", "AuthorID": "57190069028", "AffiliationID": "60009647", "AffiliationName": "Paris 13 University"}, "57211715337": {"Name": "Abdelazeem H.", "AuthorID": "57211715337", "AffiliationID": "60009647", "AffiliationName": "Paris 13 University"}, "57211711000": {"Name": "Bouhadoun A.", "AuthorID": "57211711000", "AffiliationID": "60009647", "AffiliationName": "Paris 13 University"}, "57220442717": {"Name": "Yung S.", "AuthorID": "57220442717", "AffiliationID": "60009647", "AffiliationName": "Paris 13 University"}, "57211778641": {"Name": "Li F.", "AuthorID": "57211778641", "AffiliationID": "60000905, 60022785, 60123697", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Paris, INSERM, UMR-S 1148, CHU X.
