The main classes of search algorithm and energy function are summarized, and we discuss the growing role of methods based on machine learning. We illustrate the current status of the field with examples taken from metallic, inorganic and organic systems. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Dynamic in situ microscopy relating structure and function'.", "AuthorKeywords": ["crystals", "structural chemistry", "structure prediction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Current status", "Energy functions", "In-situ microscopies", "On-machines", "Organic systems", "Search Algorithms", "Structure prediction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094662423", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"7003322273": {"Name": "Woodley S.M.", "AuthorID": "7003322273", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57218613501": {"Name": "Catlow R.", "AuthorID": "57218613501", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff University"}, "7102132909": {"Name": "Day G.M.", "AuthorID": "7102132909", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Computational Systems Chemistry, School of Chemistry, University of Southampton"}}}
