OBJECTIVE: To validate the BNI score for prediction of above-mentioned variables and cerebral infarct and evaluate its improvement by integrating further variables which are available within the first 24 h after hemorrhage. METHODS: We included patients from a single center. The BNI score for prediction of CVS, DCI, infarct, and functional outcome was validated in our cohort using measurements of calibration and discrimination (area under the curve [AUC]). We improved it by adding additional variables, creating a novel risk score (measure by the dichotomized Glasgow Outcome Scale) and validated it in a small independent cohort. RESULTS: Of 646 patients, 41.5% developed symptomatic CVS, 22.9% DCI, 23.5% cerebral infarct, and 29% had an unfavorable outcome. The BNI score was associated with all outcome measurements. We improved functional outcome prediction accuracy by including age, BNI score, World Federation of Neurologic Surgeons, rebleeding, clipping, and hydrocephalus (AUC 0.84, 95% CI 0.8-0.87). Based on this model we created a risk score (HATCH\u2014Hemorrhage, Age, Treatment, Clinical State, Hydrocephalus), ranging 0 to 13 points. We validated it in a small independent cohort. The validated score demonstrated very good discriminative ability (AUC 0.84 [95% CI 0.72-0.96]). CONCLUSION: We developed the HATCH score, which is a moderate predictor of DCI, but excellent predictor of functional outcome at 1 yr after aSAH.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Barrow neurological institute grade", "Delayed cerebral ischemia", "Outcome", "Prediction", "Subarachnoid hemorrhage"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096754446", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57105716400": {"Name": "Hostettler I.C.", "AuthorID": "57105716400", "AffiliationID": "60103459, 60019722", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University Munich"}, "57201197649": {"Name": "Seb\u00f6k M.", "AuthorID": "57201197649", "AffiliationID": "101308103", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neuroscience Center Zurich"}, "26434373300": {"Name": "Pr\u00f6mmel P.", "AuthorID": "26434373300", "AffiliationID": "60019619, 60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich"}, "55353571600": {"Name": "Neidert M.C.", "AuthorID": "55353571600", "AffiliationID": "60019619, 60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich"}, "7004240836": {"Name": "Regli L.", "AuthorID": "7004240836", "AffiliationID": "101308103", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neuroscience Center Zurich"}, "8511438600": {"Name": "Germans M.R.", "AuthorID": "8511438600", "AffiliationID": "101308103", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neuroscience Center Zurich"}, "7003730066": {"Name": "Ambler G.", "AuthorID": "7003730066", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "15060501000": {"Name": "Muroi C.", "AuthorID": "15060501000", "AffiliationID": "60019619", "AffiliationName": "Neurocritical Care Unit, Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital Zurich"}, "57149863100": {"Name": "Richter J.K.", "AuthorID": "57149863100", "AffiliationID": "60010987, 60020486", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diagnostic, Interventional and Pediatric Radiology (DIPR), Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern"}, "6506761555": {"Name": "Pangalu A.", "AuthorID": "6506761555", "AffiliationID": "60019619, 60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroradiology, University Hospital, University of Zurich"}}}
