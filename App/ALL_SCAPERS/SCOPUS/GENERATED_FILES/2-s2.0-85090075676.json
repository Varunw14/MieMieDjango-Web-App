{"Title": "Psychological support for orthognathic patients: Who is doing what?", "Year": 2020, "Source": "J Orthod", "Volume": "47", "Issue": 3, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 205, "PageEnd": 212, "CitedBy": 0, "DOI": "10.1177/1465312520929032", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85090075676&origin=inward", "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate: (1) orthodontists' training experience in the psychological assessment of orthognathic patients and their wish for training/further training; (2) the availability of psychological support, referral patterns and outcomes after referral; (3) and adverse incidents prompting orthodontists to refer patients for psychological assessment. DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional study. METHODS: A 25-item questionnaire was designed to investigate the above mentioned aims. After a pilot study, the questionnaire was distributed to all members of the Consultant Orthodontist Group, British Orthodontic Society. RESULTS: Based on a 29.1% response rate (n = 102), 76.5% of respondents had undertaken training in identifying orthognathic patients who may benefit from psychological assessment. However, 90.2% favoured further training. All respondents believed that some orthognathic patients would benefit from referral; however, 31.3% of units referred no patients at all, mostly due to limited/no access (66.7%). Most referrals (68.9%) were to psychiatrists/psychologists with dentofacial deformity expertise, with 28.9% of units having such services onsite (14 different units). Psychological referrals had potentially useful outcomes, with 36.4% of respondents sometimes changing treatment plans following referral. Clinical incidents were experienced by 35.1% of respondents, prompting referral of patients for psychological assessment; such incidents included patient suicides (n = 4). CONCLUSION: Most respondents had trained in psychological assessment of orthognathic patients; however there was a large demand for further training. Clinicians value the psychological services available; however, limited availability may affect referrals for some respondents. Adverse incidents are of real concern and highlight the need to ensure that training and resources are provided to support orthognathic patients and teams.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adverse incident", "body dysmorphic disorder", "clinical psychologist", "liaison psychiatrist", "mental health professional", "orthognathic surgery", "orthognathic treatment", "psychology", "referrals", "training"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cross-Sectional Studies", "Humans", "Pilot Projects", "Prospective Studies", "Societies, Dental", "Suicide", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090075676", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthodontics", "DENT", "3505"]], "AuthorData": {"57218694036": {"Name": "Sinnott P.M.", "AuthorID": "57218694036", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60013985", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthodontics, Eastman Dental Hospital (University College London Hospitals)"}, "14056940800": {"Name": "Shute J.", "AuthorID": "14056940800", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60013985", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthodontics, Eastman Dental Hospital (University College London Hospitals)"}, "35378926500": {"Name": "Hunt N.", "AuthorID": "35378926500", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthodontics, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, Rockefeller Building"}, "7201937126": {"Name": "Cunningham S.", "AuthorID": "7201937126", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthodontics, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, Rockefeller Building"}}}
