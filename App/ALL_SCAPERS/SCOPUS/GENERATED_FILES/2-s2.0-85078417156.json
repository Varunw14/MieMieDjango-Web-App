A major barrier to entry of this technology is the lack of non-destructive quality control methods capable of verifying the dosage of multiple drugs in polyprintlets at the point of dispensing. In the present study, 3D printed films and cylindrical polyprintlets were loaded with flexible, therapeutic dosages of two distinct drugs (amlodipine and lisinopril) across concentration ranges of 1\u20135% w/w and 2\u201310% w/w, respectively. The polyprintlets were non-destructively analysed for dose content using a portable near infrared (NIR) spectrometer and validated calibration models were developed using partial least squares (PLS) regression, which showed excellent linearity (R2 Pred = 0.997, 0.991), accuracy (RMSEP = 0.24%, 0.24%) and specificity (LV1 = 82.77%, 79.55%) for amlodipine and lisinopril, respectively. X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that sintering partially transformed the phase of both drugs from the crystalline to amorphous forms. For the first time, we report a non-destructive method for quality control of two separate active ingredients in a single 3D printed drug product using NIR spectroscopy, overcoming a major barrier to the integration of 3D printing into clinical practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D printing", "Digital healthcare", "Near infrared spectroscopy", "Oral drug delivery systems", "Personalized medicines", "Process analytical technology (PAT)", "Selective laser sintering"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amlodipine", "Chemistry, Pharmaceutical", "Crystallization", "Lisinopril", "Printing, Three-Dimensional", "Quality Control", "Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared", "Technology, Pharmaceutical", "Thermogravimetry", "X-Ray Diffraction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078417156", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"57190062563": {"Name": "Trenfield S.J.", "AuthorID": "57190062563", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57214223597": {"Name": "Tan H.X.", "AuthorID": "57214223597", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "6602683597": {"Name": "Gaisford S.", "AuthorID": "6602683597", "AffiliationID": "60118373", "AffiliationName": "FabRx Ltd."}, "7003826707": {"Name": "Basit A.W.", "AuthorID": "7003826707", "AffiliationID": "60118373", "AffiliationName": "FabRx Ltd."}, "37037477300": {"Name": "Goyanes A.", "AuthorID": "37037477300", "AffiliationID": "60118373", "AffiliationName": "FabRx Ltd."}, "57195073188": {"Name": "Wilsdon D.", "AuthorID": "57195073188", "AffiliationID": "60099418", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer Ltd., Analytical Research and Development"}, "57188984515": {"Name": "Rowland M.", "AuthorID": "57188984515", "AffiliationID": "60099418", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer Ltd., Drug Product Design"}}}
