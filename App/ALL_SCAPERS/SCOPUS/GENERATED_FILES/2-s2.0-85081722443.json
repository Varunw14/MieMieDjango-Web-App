Linking this taxonomy to both historic and contemporary population data sets, we characterize regional populations using surnames that indicate whether their bearers are likely to be long-settled. We extend this approach in a case study application, in which we summarize intergenerational change in local populations across Great Britain over a period of 120 years. We also analyze much shorter term demographic dynamics and chart likely recent migratory flows within the country. Our research demonstrates the value of family names in characterizing long-term population change at regional and local scales. We find evidence of selective migratory flows in both time periods alongside increasing demographic diversity and distinctiveness between regions in Great Britain.", "AuthorKeywords": ["family names", "Great Britain", "internal migration", "population change", "surnames"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081722443", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"]], "AuthorData": {"56748091200": {"Name": "Kandt J.", "AuthorID": "56748091200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College London"}, "57213654087": {"Name": "van Dijk J.", "AuthorID": "57213654087", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}, "7003966507": {"Name": "Longley P.A.", "AuthorID": "7003966507", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}}}
