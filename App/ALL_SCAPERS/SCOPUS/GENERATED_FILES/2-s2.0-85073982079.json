Being the main molecular carrier of oxygen, water is a tracer of the origin and the evolution mechanisms of planets. For temperate, terrestrial planets, the presence of water is of great importance as an indicator of habitable conditions. Being small and relatively cold, these planets and their atmospheres are the most challenging to observe, and therefore no atmospheric spectral signatures have so far been detected6. Super-Earths\u2014planets lighter than ten Earth masses\u2014around later-type stars may provide our first opportunity to study spectroscopically the characteristics of such planets, as they are best suited for transit observations. Here, we report the detection of a spectroscopic signature of water in the atmosphere of K2-18 b\u2014a planet of eight Earth masses in the habitable zone of an M dwarf7\u2014with high statistical confidence (Atmospheric Detectability Index5 = 5.0, ~3.6\u03c3 (refs. 8,9)). In addition, the derived mean molecular weight suggests an atmosphere still containing some hydrogen. The observations were recorded with the Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3 and analysed with our dedicated, publicly available, algorithms5,9. Although the suitability of M dwarfs to host habitable worlds is still under discussion10\u201313, K2-18 b offers an unprecedented opportunity to gain insight into the composition and climate of habitable-zone planets.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073982079", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"]], "AuthorData": {"57188766482": {"Name": "Tsiaras A.", "AuthorID": "57188766482", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics & Astronomy, University College London"}, "36467405700": {"Name": "Waldmann I.P.", "AuthorID": "36467405700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics & Astronomy, University College London"}, "55893633200": {"Name": "Tinetti G.", "AuthorID": "55893633200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics & Astronomy, University College London"}, "7101645601": {"Name": "Tennyson J.", "AuthorID": "7101645601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics & Astronomy, University College London"}, "35605893200": {"Name": "Yurchenko S.N.", "AuthorID": "35605893200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics & Astronomy, University College London"}}}
