Design/methodology/approach: The study is conducted through a textual comparison of two UNESCO reports written 50 years apart. Findings: Although the educational problems facing Cambodia were similar in both reports, the recommendations differed in important ways. The 1955 report advised the country to expand slowly access to education in order to maintain quality, while the 2010 recommended quickly expanding access. A major difference found in the reports regarded the issue of fees in schooling, which did not appear in 1955. School fees in Cambodia are typically extracted through the system of private tutoring, known in the academic literature as shadow education. Such an insight, this paper argues, suggests that the difference in development approach between the two reports is one of the reasons shadow education has flourished in the country. Originality/value: Through a historical comparison of development efforts in one country, it becomes clear that the education development agenda is partly to blame for the rise of shadow education.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cambodia", "Educational development", "Partnerships", "Privatization", "Shadow education"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075978710", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"36659073100": {"Name": "Brehm W.", "AuthorID": "36659073100", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "57192891717": {"Name": "Aktas F.", "AuthorID": "57192891717", "AffiliationID": "60016446", "AffiliationName": "Yeditepe University"}}}
