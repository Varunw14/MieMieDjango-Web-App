Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of American Neurological AssociationWe report six adult patients with Tyrosinaemia type 1 (HT-1) who presented with recurrent porphyria-like neurological crises after discontinuation/interruption of 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoro-methylbenzyol)-1,3 cyclohexanedione (NTBC) treatment. The crises were life-threatening for some of the patients, with respiratory muscle paralysis requiring ventilatory support, hemodynamic disturbance due to autonomic changes requiring resuscitation, acute progressive ascending motor neuropathy causing profound impairment, recurrent seizures, and neuropathic pain. Our patients\u2019 porphyria-like presentations were variably misdiagnosed, with delay to diagnosis resulting in more severe recurrent attacks. We report the first series of neurological crises in adult patients with HT-1. These crises, which may be fatal, can be prevented and treated effectively with neurologist/physician awareness and patient education.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089598898", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57193135644": {"Name": "Dawson C.", "AuthorID": "57193135644", "AffiliationID": "60012191", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57218564858": {"Name": "Safdar S.", "AuthorID": "57218564858", "AffiliationID": "60012191", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57220360462": {"Name": "Geberhiwot T.", "AuthorID": "57220360462", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research, University of Birmingham"}, "57195300714": {"Name": "Ramachandran R.", "AuthorID": "57195300714", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Adult Inherited Metabolic Disease Unit, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56497461300": {"Name": "Murphy E.", "AuthorID": "56497461300", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Charles Dent Metabolic Unit, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "12646141400": {"Name": "Swayne O.", "AuthorID": "12646141400", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Neurorehabilitation Unit, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57218567682": {"Name": "Katz J.", "AuthorID": "57218567682", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Endocrinology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56091606600": {"Name": "Newsome P.N.", "AuthorID": "56091606600", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Liver & Gastrointestinal Research, Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham"}}}
