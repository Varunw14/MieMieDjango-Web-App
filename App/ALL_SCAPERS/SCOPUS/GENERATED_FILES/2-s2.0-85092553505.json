Because of the strong interaction with the core of the two trajectories, the spiral could be employed as an optimal tool for probing the target after ionization and for revealing obfuscated phases in the bound states. We find that the spiral is responsible for interference carpets, formerly ascribed to direct trajectories, and that the carpet-interference condition is derived from the field symmetry. This case of mistaken identity may have prevented the spiral from being used as a holographic tool.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bound state", "Holographic interference", "Holographic structures", "Interference condition", "Laser fields", "Strong field ionization", "Strong interaction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092553505", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"56816436900": {"Name": "Maxwell A.S.", "AuthorID": "56816436900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "55802234600": {"Name": "Faria C.F.D.M.", "AuthorID": "55802234600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "26534484500": {"Name": "Lai X.Y.", "AuthorID": "26534484500", "AffiliationID": "60019706, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Magnetic Resonance and Atomic and Molecular Physics, Wuhan Institute of Physics and Mathematics, Innovation Academy for Precision Measurement Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "56196690900": {"Name": "Sun R.P.", "AuthorID": "56196690900", "AffiliationID": "60019706, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Magnetic Resonance and Atomic and Molecular Physics, Wuhan Institute of Physics and Mathematics, Innovation Academy for Precision Measurement Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "35337195100": {"Name": "Liu X.J.", "AuthorID": "35337195100", "AffiliationID": "60019706, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Magnetic Resonance and Atomic and Molecular Physics, Wuhan Institute of Physics and Mathematics, Innovation Academy for Precision Measurement Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}}}
