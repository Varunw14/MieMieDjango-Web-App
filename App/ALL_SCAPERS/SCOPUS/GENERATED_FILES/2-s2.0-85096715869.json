The results obtained were compared to experimental data from the literature to assess the validity and robustness of the models, and a good validation has been obtained. The performance of the packed bed and coated wall microreactors is similar at a constant reforming temperature. It was found that methanol conversion is enhanced with increasing temperature, residence time, steam to methanol ratio, and catalyst coating thickness. Furthermore, internal and external mass transfer phenomena were investigated using the models, and it was found that there were no internal and external mass transfer resistances for this reactor configuration. Further studies demonstrated that larger catalyst pellet sizes led to the presence of internal mass transfer resistance, which in turn causes lower methanol conversions. The CFD models have exhibited a sound agreement with the experimental data, hence they can be used to predict the steam reforming of methanol in microreactors.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["External mass transfer", "Increasing temperatures", "Internal mass transfer", "Methanol conversion", "Methanol steam reforming", "Reactor configuration", "Reforming temperatures", "Steam reforming of methanol"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096715869", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"57203246837": {"Name": "Hafeez S.", "AuthorID": "57203246837", "AffiliationID": "60031237", "AffiliationName": "Division of Chemical and Energy Engineering, School of Engineering, London South Bank University Email"}, "6507454597": {"Name": "Aristodemou E.", "AuthorID": "6507454597", "AffiliationID": "60031237", "AffiliationName": "Division of Chemical and Energy Engineering, School of Engineering, London South Bank University Email"}, "35558454600": {"Name": "Constantinou A.", "AuthorID": "35558454600", "AffiliationID": "60077474", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Cyprus University of Technology 57 Corner of Athinon and Anexartisias"}, "7004913362": {"Name": "Manos G.", "AuthorID": "7004913362", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "21741893000": {"Name": "Al-Salem S.M.", "AuthorID": "21741893000", "AffiliationID": "60040278", "AffiliationName": "Environment and Life Sciences Research Centre, Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research"}}}
