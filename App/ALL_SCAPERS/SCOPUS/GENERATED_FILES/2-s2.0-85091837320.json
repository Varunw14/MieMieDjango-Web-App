We describe how we are bringing together these two aspects of nanobridge SQUIDs with the aim of realizing single spin-flip detection using microwave inductive readout techniques, where the nanobridge SQUID is integrated into a superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator. Using electron beam lithography (EBL) is ideal for fabricating nanobridge junctions and has the advantage of being easily scalable compared to using a focused ion beam. In this article, we demonstrate that EBL is suitable for fabricating nanobridge junction SQUIDs, and they exhibit very comparable performance to previous focused ion beam milled SQUIDs. Our intrated devices show potential to be used for flux-tunable sensors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electron beam lithography (EBL)", "focused ion beam", "nanobridge superconducting quantum interference devices (nanoSQUIDs)", "nanoscale", "SQUIDs", "superconducting microwave devices"], "IndexKeywords": ["High frequency operation", "Nanobridge", "Single spin", "Tunable Sensors", "Very low noise", "Waveguide resonators"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091837320", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57201196372": {"Name": "Godfrey T.", "AuthorID": "57201196372", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "57218664218": {"Name": "Long G.", "AuthorID": "57218664218", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}, "16218796100": {"Name": "Gallop J.", "AuthorID": "16218796100", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}, "7403240913": {"Name": "Cox D.", "AuthorID": "7403240913", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "University of Surrey"}, "57218170552": {"Name": "Polychroniou E.", "AuthorID": "57218170552", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College"}, "34769536200": {"Name": "Hao L.", "AuthorID": "34769536200", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}, "6701351606": {"Name": "Romans E.", "AuthorID": "6701351606", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "56477430300": {"Name": "Chen J.", "AuthorID": "56477430300", "AffiliationID": "60020623", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Brunel University"}}}
