Materials and methods: An international oral health working group (OHWG) was established, of patient advocates, researchers, clinicians and public health experts to develop an AOHSS. PubMed was searched for oral health clinical and patient-reported measures and case-mix variables related to caries and periodontal disease. The selected patient-reported outcome measures focused on general oral health, and oral health-related quality of life tools. A consensus was reached via Delphi with parallel consultation of subject matter content experts. Finally, comments and input were elicited from oral health stakeholders globally, including patients/consumers. Results: The literature search yielded 1,453 results. After inclusion/exclusion criteria, 959 abstracts generated potential outcomes and case-mix variables. Delphi rounds resulted in a consensus-based selection of 80 individual items capturing 31 outcome and case-mix concepts. Global reviews generated 347 responses from 87 countries, and the patient/consumer validation survey elicited 129 responses. This AOHSS includes 25 items directed towards patients (including demographics, the impact of their oral health on oral function, a record of pain and oral hygiene practices, and financial implications of care) and items for clinicians to complete, including medical history, a record of caries and periodontal disease activity, and types of dental treatment delivered. Conclusion: In conclusion, utilising a robust methodology, a standardised core set of oral health outcome measures for adults, with a particular emphasis on caries and periodontal disease, was developed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Oral health", "outcome measures", "patient outcome assessment", "quality of life"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087445857", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"8266665000": {"Name": "Ni Riordain R.", "AuthorID": "8266665000", "AffiliationID": "60025160", "AffiliationName": "University College Cork"}, "7102493226": {"Name": "Glick M.", "AuthorID": "7102493226", "AffiliationID": "60032083", "AffiliationName": "School of Dental Medicine, University at Buffalo"}, "57217630196": {"Name": "Al Mashhadani S.S.A.", "AuthorID": "57217630196", "AffiliationID": "60121824", "AffiliationName": "Dubai Health Authority"}, "12646763300": {"Name": "Aravamudhan K.", "AuthorID": "12646763300", "AffiliationID": "60022197", "AffiliationName": "American Dental Association"}, "55799507200": {"Name": "Barrow J.", "AuthorID": "55799507200", "AffiliationID": "60005856", "AffiliationName": "Harvard School of Dental Medicine"}, "57089704100": {"Name": "Cole D.", "AuthorID": "57089704100", "AffiliationID": "60090273", "AffiliationName": "Dental Health Services Victoria"}, "7004517441": {"Name": "Crall J.J.", "AuthorID": "7004517441", "AffiliationID": "60023227", "AffiliationName": "UCLA School of Dentistry"}, "7402209861": {"Name": "Gallagher J.E.", "AuthorID": "7402209861", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King\u2019s College London"}, "57217630354": {"Name": "Gibson J.", "AuthorID": "57217630354", "AffiliationID": "124721062", "AffiliationName": "ICHOM Adult Oral Health Working Group"}, "57217629983": {"Name": "Kaberry R.", "AuthorID": "57217629983", "AffiliationID": "124721062", "AffiliationName": "ICHOM Adult Oral Health Working Group"}, "26428218800": {"Name": "Kalenderian E.", "AuthorID": "26428218800", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "UCSF School of Dentistry"}, "36767853800": {"Name": "Karki A.", "AuthorID": "36767853800", "AffiliationID": "60111558", "AffiliationName": "Public Health Wales"}, "15519515100": {"Name": "Celeste R.K.", "AuthorID": "15519515100", "AffiliationID": "115161640", "AffiliationName": "Federal University of Rio Grande do Sol, Porto Alegre"}, "35759488300": {"Name": "Listl S.", "AuthorID": "35759488300", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dentistry \u2013 Quality and Safety of Oral Health Care, Radboud University \u2013 Radboudumc (RIHS)"}, "7006668589": {"Name": "Niederman R.", "AuthorID": "7006668589", "AffiliationID": "60108355", "AffiliationName": "NYU College of Dentistry"}, "57218182418": {"Name": "Smith M.W.", "AuthorID": "57218182418", "AffiliationID": "108609164", "AffiliationName": "Hospitals Contribution Fund"}, "7201689009": {"Name": "Thomson W.M.", "AuthorID": "7201689009", "AffiliationID": "60017311", "AffiliationName": "University of Otago"}, "57204336866": {"Name": "Tsakos G.", "AuthorID": "57204336866", "AffiliationID": "124720749", "AffiliationName": "FDI Vision 2020 Think Tank"}, "8973108000": {"Name": "Vujicic M.", "AuthorID": "8973108000", "AffiliationID": "60022197", "AffiliationName": "American Dental Association"}, "7406554123": {"Name": "Williams D.M.", "AuthorID": "7406554123", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Bart\u2019s and The London, School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary, University of London"}, "7102907522": {"Name": "Watt R.G.", "AuthorID": "7102907522", "AffiliationID": "124720749", "AffiliationName": "FDI Vision 2020 Think Tank"}, "57191172888": {"Name": "Hegde S.", "AuthorID": "57191172888", "AffiliationID": "60090273", "AffiliationName": "Dental Health Services Victoria"}, "57217632507": {"Name": "Myers S.N.", "AuthorID": "57217632507", "AffiliationID": "116590020", "AffiliationName": "International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM)"}, "57216150543": {"Name": "Whittaker S.", "AuthorID": "57216150543", "AffiliationID": "116590020", "AffiliationName": "International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM)"}, "55571026600": {"Name": "Severin T.", "AuthorID": "55571026600", "AffiliationID": "124262772", "AffiliationName": "FDI World Dental Federation (FDI)"}}}
