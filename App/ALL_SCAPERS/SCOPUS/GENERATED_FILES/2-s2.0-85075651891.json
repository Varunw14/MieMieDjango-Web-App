Instead of producing one network for each possible subset of observed modalities or using arithmetic operations to combine feature maps, our hetero-modal variational 3D encoder-decoder independently embeds all observed modalities into a shared latent representation. Missing data and tumour segmentation can be then generated from this embedding. In our scenario, the input is a random subset of modalities. We demonstrate that the optimisation problem can be seen as a mixture sampling. In addition to this, we introduce a new network architecture building upon both the 3D U-Net and the Multi-Modal Variational Auto-Encoder (MVAE). Finally, we evaluate our method on BraTS2018 using subsets of the imaging modalities as input. Our model outperforms the current state-of-the-art method for dealing with missing modalities and achieves similar performance to the subset-specific equivalent networks.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Arithmetic operations", "Encoder-decoder", "Equivalent network", "Imaging modality", "Learning methods", "Optimisation problems", "Random subsets", "State-of-the-art methods"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075651891", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57212001523": {"Name": "Dorent R.", "AuthorID": "57212001523", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "57212007029": {"Name": "Joutard S.", "AuthorID": "57212007029", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "24376919100": {"Name": "Modat M.", "AuthorID": "24376919100", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "23010613000": {"Name": "Vercauteren T.", "AuthorID": "23010613000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}}}
