All rights reserved.High Resolution X-Ray Computed Tomography (HRXCT) offers a powerful 3-dimensional, nondestructive and non-invasive diagnostic tool for imaging the external and internal structures of a range of specimens of interest including archaeobotanical remains. HRXCT offers new possibilities in terms of the research questions which may be asked of fragile and valuable archaeological and specifically archaeobotanical material. This technology, although currently somewhat limited in terms of time and access to beamtimes at National Synchrotrons, requires simple, non-destructive preparation of samples and produces exciting results. Based upon two rounds of successful work, we believe that this new methodology has wider implications and utility for advancing the field of imaging, and investigating aspects of plant domestication such as internal anatomical changes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Archaeobotany", "High-Resolution X-Ray Computed Tomography (HRXCT)", "Imaging", "Morphometrics", "Synchrotron"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078251258", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"55500340100": {"Name": "Murphy C.", "AuthorID": "55500340100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Institute of Archaeology"}, "57208724215": {"Name": "Fuller D.Q.", "AuthorID": "57208724215", "AffiliationID": "60001298", "AffiliationName": "School of Cultural Heritage, Northwest University"}, "26034718600": {"Name": "Stevens C.", "AuthorID": "26034718600", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "School of Archaeology and Museology, Peking University"}, "57191966781": {"Name": "Gregory T.", "AuthorID": "57191966781", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Institute of Archaeology"}, "57202578541": {"Name": "Dal Martello R.", "AuthorID": "57202578541", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Institute of Archaeology"}, "16246132100": {"Name": "Silva F.", "AuthorID": "16246132100", "AffiliationID": "60105000", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Humanities and Performing Arts, University of Wales Trinity Saint David"}, "36118397000": {"Name": "Song J.", "AuthorID": "36118397000", "AffiliationID": "60016521", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology, Center for Archaeological Science, Sichuan University"}, "57064238500": {"Name": "Bodey A.J.", "AuthorID": "57064238500", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "57205077339": {"Name": "Rau C.", "AuthorID": "57205077339", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}}}
