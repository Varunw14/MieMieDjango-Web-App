This paper explores the views of pupils, parents/carers and teachers of \u2018home-school\u2019 in one Norwegian municipality, gathered through parallel online surveys in April 2020 during the peak of the COVID-19 lockdown period. It finds that adaptation happened very quickly and that home-school was well received by pupils and parents. There was more creative learning, better progress, more useful feedback and greater student independence. School leaders reported that they wanted to implement changes based on the experience of remote learning enforced by the lockdown, so that the crisis has become an opportunity for grassroots innovation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["COVID-19", "home-schooling", "school improvement", "student voice"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091006813", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"8440531200": {"Name": "Bubb S.", "AuthorID": "8440531200", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Education"}, "57214669174": {"Name": "Jones M.A.", "AuthorID": "57214669174", "AffiliationID": "60013141", "AffiliationName": "Norwegian University of Science and Technology"}}}
