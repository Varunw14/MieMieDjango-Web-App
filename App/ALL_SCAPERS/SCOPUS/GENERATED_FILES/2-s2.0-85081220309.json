The aim of this study was to benchmark trends in 1-year and hospital volume outcomes for this condition. Methods: This study included all infants born with CDH in England between 2003 and 2016. This was a retrospective analysis of the Hospital Episode Statistics database. The main outcomes were: 1-year mortality, neonatal length of hospital stay (nLOS), total bed-days at 1 year and readmission rate. The association between hospital volume and outcomes was assessed for specialist paediatric surgery centres. Results: A total of 2336 infants were included (incidence 2\u00b75 per 10 000 live births). No significant time trends were found in incidence and main outcomes. Some 1491 infants (63\u00b78 per cent) underwent surgical repair. The 1-year mortality rate was 31\u00b72 per cent. Median nLOS and total bed-days were 17 and 19 days respectively. The readmission rate in specialist paediatric centres was 6\u00b73 per cent. Higher mortality was associated with birthweight lower than 1 kg (OR 5\u00b790, 95 per cent c.i. 1\u00b703 to 33\u00b775), gestational age of 36 weeks or less (OR 1\u00b775, 1\u00b712 to 2\u00b775) and black ethnicity (OR 2\u00b713, 1\u00b703 to 4\u00b748). Only 4\u00b70 per cent had extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, which was associated with higher mortality (OR 5\u00b734, 3\u00b701 to 9\u00b746), longer nLOS (OR 3\u00b770, 2\u00b714 to 6\u00b714) and longer total bed-days (OR 3\u00b787, 2\u00b719 to 6\u00b783). Specialist paediatric centres showed variation in 30-day mortality (4\u00b76 per cent with 84 per cent coefficient of variation), nLOS (median 25 (i.q.r. 15-42) days) and total bed-days (median 28 (i.q.r. 16-51) days), but no significant volume-outcome relationship. Conclusion: Key outcomes for CDH were similar to those of other developed countries. High variation among specialist paediatric centres was found and should be investigated further to explore the value of regionalization of care.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Birth Weight", "England", "Ethnic Groups", "Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation", "Female", "Gestational Age", "Hernias, Diaphragmatic, Congenital", "Humans", "Incidence", "Infant, Newborn", "Length of Stay", "Male", "Mortality", "Outcome Assessment, Health Care", "Patient Readmission", "Retrospective Studies", "Social Class"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081220309", "SubjectAreas": null, "AuthorData": {"57216355126": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "57216355126", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Dr Foster Unit, Department of Primary Care and Public Health, Imperial College London London UK"}, "55933643000": {"Name": "Honeyford K.", "AuthorID": "55933643000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Dr Foster Unit, Department of Primary Care and Public Health, Imperial College London London UK"}, "7003627876": {"Name": "Aylin P.", "AuthorID": "7003627876", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Dr Foster Unit, Department of Primary Care and Public Health, Imperial College London London UK"}, "6701752249": {"Name": "Bottle A.", "AuthorID": "6701752249", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Dr Foster Unit, Department of Primary Care and Public Health, Imperial College London London UK"}, "57219301169": {"Name": "Giuliani S.", "AuthorID": "57219301169", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": null}}}
