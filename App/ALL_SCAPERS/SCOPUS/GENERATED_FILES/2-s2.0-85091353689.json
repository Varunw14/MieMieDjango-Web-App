Results revealed that hardness of Ti-10Mo-xCu alloy increased from 355.1 \u00b1 15.2 HV to 390.8 \u00b1 17.6 HV by increasing Cu content from 0 % to 5 %, much higher than CP Ti (106.6 \u00b1 15.1 HV) and comparable to Ti64 (389.7 \u00b1 13.9 HV). With a higher Cu content, wear and tribocorrosion resistance of Ti-10Mo-xCu alloys were enhanced, and corrosion resistance showed an initial increase with a subsequent decrease. Wear mechanisms under pure mechanical wear and tribocorrosion conditions of Ti-10Mo-xCu alloys were a combination of delamination, abrasion and adhesion wear.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bone implants", "Corrosion", "Ti-10Mo-xCu alloys", "Tribocorrosion", "Wear"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adhesion wear", "Bone implant", "Cu content", "Effects of Cu content", "Load bearing", "Mo-Cu alloys", "Tribo-corrosion", "Wear mechanisms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091353689", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"55266994800": {"Name": "Lu X.", "AuthorID": "55266994800", "AffiliationID": "60018273", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Materials Genome Engineering, Institute for Advanced Materials and Technology, State Key Laboratory for Advanced Metals and Materials, University of Science and Technology Beijing"}, "57216591537": {"Name": "Zhang D.", "AuthorID": "57216591537", "AffiliationID": "60018273", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Materials Genome Engineering, Institute for Advanced Materials and Technology, State Key Laboratory for Advanced Metals and Materials, University of Science and Technology Beijing"}, "57190249408": {"Name": "Xu W.", "AuthorID": "57190249408", "AffiliationID": "60014311, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Dental School, University of Bristol"}, "57216882737": {"Name": "Yu A.", "AuthorID": "57216882737", "AffiliationID": "60018273", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Materials Genome Engineering, Institute for Advanced Materials and Technology, State Key Laboratory for Advanced Metals and Materials, University of Science and Technology Beijing"}, "57219018639": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "57219018639", "AffiliationID": "60018273", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Materials Genome Engineering, Institute for Advanced Materials and Technology, State Key Laboratory for Advanced Metals and Materials, University of Science and Technology Beijing"}, "7202660941": {"Name": "Qu X.", "AuthorID": "7202660941", "AffiliationID": "60018273", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Materials Genome Engineering, Institute for Advanced Materials and Technology, State Key Laboratory for Advanced Metals and Materials, University of Science and Technology Beijing"}, "55581409800": {"Name": "Tamaddon M.", "AuthorID": "55581409800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedic & Musculoskeletal Science, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "57188879979": {"Name": "Liu C.", "AuthorID": "57188879979", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedic & Musculoskeletal Science, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "57216671683": {"Name": "Su B.", "AuthorID": "57216671683", "AffiliationID": "60014311, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Dental School, University of Bristol"}, "35217451000": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "35217451000", "AffiliationID": "60018273", "AffiliationName": "School of Metallurgical and Ecological Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing"}}}
