Understanding the molecular pathology of AD during disease progression may identify new ways to reduce neuronal damage. Here, we present a longitudinal study tracking dynamic proteomic alterations in the brains of an inducible Drosophila melanogaster model of AD expressing the Arctic mutant A\u03b242 gene. We identified 3093 proteins from flies that were induced to express A\u03b242 and age-matched healthy controls using label-free quantitative ion-mobility data independent analysis mass spectrometry. Of these, 228 proteins were significantly altered by A\u03b242 accumulation and were enriched for AD-associated processes. Network analyses further revealed that these proteins have distinct hub and bottleneck properties in the brain protein interaction network, suggesting that several may have significant effects on brain function. Our unbiased analysis provides useful insights into the key processes governing the progression of amyloid toxicity and forms a basis for further functional analyses in model organisms and translation to mammalian systems.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Animals", "Brain", "Disease Models, Animal", "Disease Progression", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Drosophila Proteins", "Longitudinal Studies", "Neurons", "Peptide Fragments", "Protein Interaction Maps", "Proteomics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094219320", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57193591865": {"Name": "Scholes H.M.", "AuthorID": "57193591865", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "55559403100": {"Name": "Cryar A.", "AuthorID": "55559403100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "57219613072": {"Name": "Sutherland D.", "AuthorID": "57219613072", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "9636068500": {"Name": "Lees J.G.", "AuthorID": "9636068500", "AffiliationID": "60014564", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Oxford Brookes University"}, "7006781333": {"Name": "Orengo C.A.", "AuthorID": "7006781333", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "15840628700": {"Name": "Thalassinos K.", "AuthorID": "15840628700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "7005439666": {"Name": "Kerr F.", "AuthorID": "7005439666", "AffiliationID": "60007573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, School of Health and Life Sciences, Glasgow Caledonian University"}, "57202667589": {"Name": "Partridge L.", "AuthorID": "57202667589", "AffiliationID": "60103814", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing"}, "55331575600": {"Name": "Gethings L.A.", "AuthorID": "55331575600", "AffiliationID": "60016167", "AffiliationName": "Waters Corporation"}, "7003516548": {"Name": "Vissers J.P.C.", "AuthorID": "7003516548", "AffiliationID": "60016167", "AffiliationName": "Waters Corporation"}}}
