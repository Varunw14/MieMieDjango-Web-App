Methods: Systematic search for papers reporting incidence of sustained amenorrhea \u226512 months in ARD following: IV cyclophosphamide; or GnRHa and IV cyclophosphamide compared to IV cyclophosphamide alone. Results: From 31 articles and 1388 patients (mean age 27.7 years) sustained amenorrhea occurred in 273 patients (19.7%). Of 56 patients (mean age range 23.9\u201325.6 years) receiving GnRHa and IV cyclophosphamide, and 37 controls (mean age range 25\u201330.1 years) given IV cyclophosphamide only, sustained amenorrhea occurred in 2/56 (3.6%) patients treated with GnRHa, compared to 15/37 (40.5%) controls. Pooled odds ratio of sustained amenorrhea with GnRHa and cyclophosphamide versus cyclophosphamide alone was 0.054 (95% CI 0.0115\u20130.2576 p < 0.001), corresponding to a number needed to treat of 2.7 (95% CI 1.955\u20134.388) and absolute risk reduction of 36.95% (95% CI 35.6\u201338.4%). Conclusion: Sustained amenorrhea with IV cyclophosphamide was observed in patients with ARD, especially with increasing age and cumulative doses >5 g. GnRHa reduced this risk and should be considered with IV cyclophosphamide in women of childbearing age with ARD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cyclophosphamide", "gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists", "rheumatic disease", "Sustained amenorrhea"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081741101", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"57215721161": {"Name": "Luong S.N.", "AuthorID": "57215721161", "AffiliationID": "60011463, 60028333", "AffiliationName": "South Western Sydney Clinical School, Faculty of Medicine, University of New South Wales"}, "57216065169": {"Name": "Isaacs A.", "AuthorID": "57216065169", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, University College London Hospital"}, "57203896536": {"Name": "Sin F.E.", "AuthorID": "57203896536", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, University College London Hospital"}, "57216022963": {"Name": "Giles I.", "AuthorID": "57216022963", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology, Division of Medicine, Rayne Institute, University College London"}, "55583172800": {"Name": "Liu Z.", "AuthorID": "55583172800", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "Stats Central, Mark Wainwright Analytical Centre, University of New South Wales"}}}
