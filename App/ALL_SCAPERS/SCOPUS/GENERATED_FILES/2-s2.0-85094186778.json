Published by BMJ.Purpose To report the outcomes of intravitreal methotrexate (MTX) injections to rescue eyes with relapsed primary intraocular lymphoma (PIOL). Methods Retrospective case series of patients with ocular relapse of PIOL who had initially received systemic chemotherapy (all five cases) and external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) to brain and orbits (two cases). Injections of MTX (400 \u00b5g/0.1 mL) were given one time per week for 1 month, every other week for 4 months, followed by a maintenance phase of one injection one time per month for 8 months (total of 20 injections in a year). Results From April 2008 to February 2016, there were nine eyes of five patients (three men; average age at first presentation 62 years) treated with our rescue protocol of intravitreal MTX injections. Ocular relapse occurred at a mean interval of 15 months (range 5-34 months) after the completion of initial systemic treatment. At mean follow-up of 31 months (range 5-104 months), tumour control was achieved in eight out of nine eyes (89%); one eye failed, with persistent retinal infiltrates despite increasing the frequency of injections, resulting in severe keratopathy. The only other complication occurred in one eye, developing cystoid macular oedema from MTX injections that resolved with topical anti-inflammatory medications and reduced frequency of MTX. There were no cases of reduced vision or ocular relapse, but two patients died (one of central nervous system lymphoma). Conclusions Intravitreal MTX was a safe and effective treatment modality for relapsed PIOL after systemic chemotherapy and radiotherapy, achieving local tumour control in 89%, and hence represents an optimal choice. However, given the rare nature of PIOL, larger collaborative studies with longer follow-up are needed to corroborate this.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094186778", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"57220476688": {"Name": "Mohammad M.", "AuthorID": "57220476688", "AffiliationID": "60057457", "AffiliationName": "Ocular Oncology Service, King Hussein Cancer Center"}, "7402135808": {"Name": "Andrews R.M.", "AuthorID": "7402135808", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "55759644400": {"Name": "Hay G.", "AuthorID": "55759644400", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "56926100600": {"Name": "Arora A.K.", "AuthorID": "56926100600", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "54790539900": {"Name": "Cohen V.M.L.", "AuthorID": "54790539900", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57203054292": {"Name": "Sagoo M.S.", "AuthorID": "57203054292", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "6504526215": {"Name": "Nicholas Plowman P.", "AuthorID": "6504526215", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}}}
