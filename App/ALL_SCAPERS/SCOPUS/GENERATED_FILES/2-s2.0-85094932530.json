To compare membranous lupus nephritis (MLN) and proliferative lupus nephritis (PLN) with respect to survival, demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics; and to investigate predictors of renal and patient survival. Methods. Single-centre retrospective observational study. Patients with biopsy-proven PLN, MLN and mixed lupus nephritis were included. Groups were compared using appropriate statistical tests and survival was analysed through the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox regression analysis was performed to investigate predictors of renal and patient survival. Results. A total of 187 patients with biopsy-proven lupus nephritis (135 with PLN, 38 with MLN and 14 with mixed LN) were followed for up to 42 years (median 12 years). There was a higher proportion of MLN amongst Afro-Caribbeans than amongst Caucasians (31% vs 15%, P \u00bc 0.010). Patients with MLN had significantly lower anti-dsDNA antibodies (P \u00bc 0.001) and higher C3 levels (P \u00bc 0.018) at diagnosis. Cumulative renal survival rates at 5, 10, 15 and 20 years were 91, 81, 75 and 66% for PLN and 100, 97, 92 and 84% for MLN, respectively (P \u00bc 0.028). Cumulative patient survival at 5, 10, 15 and 20 years was 94, 86, 80 and 76%, with no difference between PLN and MLN. Urinary protein-creatinine ratio above 42 mg/mmol and eGFR below 76 ml/min/1.73 m2, one year after the diagnosis of LN, were the strongest predictors of progression to end-stage renal disease. eGFR below 77 ml/min/1.73 m2, at one year, development of end-stage renal disease and Afro-Caribbean ethnicity were associated with higher mortality. Conclusion. Patients with MLN and PLN differ significantly regarding serological profiles and renal survival, suggesting different pathogenesis. Renal function at year one predicts renal and patient survival.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Lupus nephritis", "Outcomes", "Survival", "Systemic lupus erythematosus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Antibodies", "Biomarkers", "Complement C3", "Disease Progression", "DNA", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Glomerular Filtration Rate", "Humans", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Kidney", "Lupus Nephritis", "Male", "Regression Analysis", "Retrospective Studies", "Time Factors", "Tissue Survival"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094932530", "SubjectAreas": [["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"]], "AuthorData": {"56669650600": {"Name": "Farinha F.", "AuthorID": "56669650600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology, University College London"}, "56042622600": {"Name": "McDonnell T.", "AuthorID": "56042622600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology, University College London"}, "57201108555": {"Name": "Isenberg D.A.", "AuthorID": "57201108555", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology, University College London"}, "57212819228": {"Name": "Rahman A.", "AuthorID": "57212819228", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology, University College London"}, "22635508400": {"Name": "Pepper R.J.", "AuthorID": "22635508400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nephrology, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "57219718011": {"Name": "Oliveira D.G.", "AuthorID": "57219718011", "AffiliationID": "120883496", "AffiliationName": "Internal Medicine Department, Centro Hospitalar e Universit\u00e1rio do Porto"}}}
