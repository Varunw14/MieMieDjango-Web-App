Currently, in order to mass produce CNT devices, either large-scale synthesis, followed by numerous energy-intensive processing steps or photolithography processes, including several sputter-deposition steps, are required to pattern this material to fabricate functional devices. In the work reported here, through the utilization of a universal catalyst precursor (cyclopentadienyl iron dicarbonyl dimer) and the optimization of solution parameters, patterned high-quality vertically aligned arrays of single- and few-walled CNTs have been synthesized via various inexpensive, commercially scalable methods such as inkjet printing, stamp printing, spray painting, and even handwriting. The two-step process of precursor printing, followed immediately by CNT growth, results in CNTs with a Raman ID/IG ratio of 0.073, demonstrating very high-quality nanotubes. This process eliminates time-consuming and costly CNT post processing techniques or the deposition of numerous substrate barrier and catalyst layers to achieve device manufacturing. As a result, this method has the potential to provide a route for the large-scale synthesis of high-quality single- and few-walled CNTs that can be applied in industrial settings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["carbon nanotubes", "catalyst", "handwriting", "patterned", "printing", "spray painting"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cyclopentadienyl iron", "Double walled carbon nanotubes", "handwriting", "Large scale synthesis", "patterned", "Photolithography process", "Post-processing techniques", "Solution parameters"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081945677", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"56502874700": {"Name": "King S.G.", "AuthorID": "56502874700", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Technology Institute, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Surrey"}, "55981914500": {"Name": "McCafferty L.", "AuthorID": "55981914500", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Technology Institute, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Surrey"}, "57208796024": {"Name": "Tas M.O.", "AuthorID": "57208796024", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Technology Institute, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Surrey"}, "57199147632": {"Name": "Snashall K.", "AuthorID": "57199147632", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Technology Institute, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Surrey"}, "56503490000": {"Name": "Chen J.S.", "AuthorID": "56503490000", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Technology Institute, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Surrey"}, "7003637769": {"Name": "Shkunov M.", "AuthorID": "7003637769", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Technology Institute, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Surrey"}, "6602589117": {"Name": "Stolojan V.", "AuthorID": "6602589117", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Technology Institute, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Surrey"}, "7203043276": {"Name": "Silva S.R.P.", "AuthorID": "7203043276", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Technology Institute, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Surrey"}}}
