All rights reserved.Purpose: This concise review aims to explore the potential for the clinical implemen-tation of artificial intelligence (AI) strategies for detecting glaucoma and monitoring glaucoma progression. Methods: Nonsystematic literature review using the search combinations \u201cArtifi-cial Intelligence,\u201d \u201cDeep Learning,\u201d \u201cMachine Learning,\u201d \u201cNeural Networks,\u201d \u201cBayesian Networks,\u201d \u201cGlaucoma Diagnosis,\u201d and \u201cGlaucoma Progression.\u201d Information on sensitivity and specificity regarding glaucoma diagnosis and progression analysis as well as methodological details were extracted. Results: Numerous AI strategies provide promising levels of specificity and sensitivity for structural (e.g. optical coherence tomography [OCT] imaging, fundus photogra-phy) and functional (visual field [VF] testing) test modalities used for the detection of glaucoma. Area under receiver operating curve (AROC) values of > 0.90 were achieved with every modality. Combining structural and functional inputs has been shown to even more improve the diagnostic ability. Regarding glaucoma progression, AI strategies can detect progression earlier than conventional methods or potentially from one single VF test. Conclusions: AI algorithms applied to fundus photographs for screening purposes may provide good results using a simple and widely accessible test. However, for patients who are likely to have glaucoma more sophisticated methods should be used including data from OCT and perimetry. Outputs may serve as an adjunct to assist clinical decision making, whereas also enhancing the efficiency, productivity, and quality of the delivery of glaucoma care. Patients with diagnosed glaucoma may benefit from future algorithms to evaluate their risk of progression. Challenges are yet to be overcome, including the external validity of AI strategies, a move from a \u201cblack box\u201d toward \u201cexplainable AI,\u201d and likely regulatory hurdles. However, it is clear that AI can enhance the role of specialist clinicians and will inevitably shape the future of the delivery of glaucoma care to the next generation. Translational Relevance: The promising levels of diagnostic accuracy reported by AI strategies across the modalities used in clinical practice for glaucoma detection can pave the way for the development of reliable models appropriate for their translation into clinical practice. Future incorporation of AI into healthcare models may help address the current limitations of access and timely management of patients with glaucoma across the world.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Artificial intelligence", "Glaucoma", "Machine learning"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85097414616", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"57188633068": {"Name": "Mursch-Edlmayr A.S.", "AuthorID": "57188633068", "AffiliationID": "60021931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Johannes Kepler University"}, "57218546953": {"Name": "Ng W.S.", "AuthorID": "57218546953", "AffiliationID": "60000020", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff Eye Unit, University Hospital of Wales"}, "14630381100": {"Name": "Diniz-Filho A.", "AuthorID": "14630381100", "AffiliationID": "60030074", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology and Otorhinolaryngology, Federal University of Minas Gerais"}, "57188627862": {"Name": "Sousa D.C.", "AuthorID": "57188627862", "AffiliationID": "60021007", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Hospital de Santa Maria"}, "57190963056": {"Name": "Arnould L.", "AuthorID": "57190963056", "AffiliationID": "60030713", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital"}, "25958753300": {"Name": "Schlenker M.B.", "AuthorID": "25958753300", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Sciences, University of Toronto"}, "57220573417": {"Name": "Duenas-Angeles K.", "AuthorID": "57220573417", "AffiliationID": "60032442", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de Mexico"}, "24480921100": {"Name": "Keane P.A.", "AuthorID": "24480921100", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60016691", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology & Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "57206495805": {"Name": "Jayaram H.", "AuthorID": "57206495805", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60016691", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology & Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "26643353200": {"Name": "Crowston J.G.", "AuthorID": "26643353200", "AffiliationID": "60024285, 60008970", "AffiliationName": "Singapore Eye Research Institute, Singapore National Eye Centre"}}}
