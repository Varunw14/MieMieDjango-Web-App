All rights reserved.In this chapter we provide a summary of the research workshops at IATBR2018. They are reflections on the conference theme and the context within which we are doing travel behavior research today. These workshops also represent some of the most exciting areas in our research. Workshop participants, coordinated by their chair(s), refined the scope of each workshop based on the assigned topic, identified research gaps, developed research themes, defined motivation for the research, and then created a list of specific research needs and questions. The wroskhops are on: Automation and Self-Driving, Mobility as a Service, Time Use and Travel, Data-Driven Learning and Travel, Transport for Healthy-Happy-Holistic Living, Life-Course and Dynamics, Big Data and Travel, and Connected Freight.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Automation", "Behavioral dynamics", "Big data", "Connected freight", "Data-driven learning", "Happy travel", "Healthy transport", "Holistic living", "Life-course", "Life-course and dynamics", "Mobility as a service", "Self-driving", "Time Use", "Travel", "Well-being"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082048263", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"57189870511": {"Name": "Davis A.W.", "AuthorID": "57189870511", "AffiliationID": "60029241", "AffiliationName": "University of California"}, "6602644697": {"Name": "Polydoropoulou A.", "AuthorID": "6602644697", "AffiliationID": "60017404", "AffiliationName": "University of the Aegean"}, "39962493300": {"Name": "Stathopoulos A.", "AuthorID": "39962493300", "AffiliationID": "60007363", "AffiliationName": "Northwestern University"}, "35573116600": {"Name": "Farooq B.", "AuthorID": "35573116600", "AffiliationID": "60030838", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Innovations in Transportation (LiTrans), Ryerson University"}, "7005935076": {"Name": "Bhat C.R.", "AuthorID": "7005935076", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "The University of Texas at Austin"}, "7004031914": {"Name": "Antoniou C.", "AuthorID": "7004031914", "AffiliationID": "60019722", "AffiliationName": "Technical University of Munich"}, "14022184900": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "14022184900", "AffiliationID": "60030788", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School for International Development and Cooperation, Hiroshima University"}, "7004456956": {"Name": "Goulias K.G.", "AuthorID": "7004456956", "AffiliationID": "60029241", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography and GeoTrans Lab, University of California"}, "7004370640": {"Name": "Mohammadian K.", "AuthorID": "7004370640", "AffiliationID": "60027561", "AffiliationName": "University of Illinois at Chicago"}, "49861504700": {"Name": "Kamargianni M.", "AuthorID": "49861504700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7005183095": {"Name": "Mokhtarian P.L.", "AuthorID": "7005183095", "AffiliationID": "60019647", "AffiliationName": "Georgia Institute of Technology"}, "7004030167": {"Name": "Pendyala R.M.", "AuthorID": "7004030167", "AffiliationID": "60003892", "AffiliationName": "Arizona State University"}, "6603900912": {"Name": "Shiftan Y.", "AuthorID": "6603900912", "AffiliationID": "60022403", "AffiliationName": "Israel Institute of Technology"}}}
