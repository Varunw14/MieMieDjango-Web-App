Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.The Chagos archipelago in the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) has been lacking in detailed genetic studies of its chondrichthyan populations. Chondrichthyes in Chagos continue to be endangered through illegal fishing operations, necessitating species distribution and abundance studies to facilitate urgent monitoring and conservation of the species. Here, we present a complete mitochondrial genome of the Silvertip Shark, Carcharhinus albimarginatus sampled in the Chagos archipelago. The mitochondrial genome of C. albimarginatus was 16,706 bp in length and consisted of 13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNA genes, two rRNA genes, a replication origin and a D-loop region. GC content was at 38.7% and the control region was 1,065 bp in length. We expect that mitogenomes presented here will aid development of molecular assays for species distribution studies. Overall these studies will promote effective conservation of marine ecosystemes in the BIOT.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chagos", "conservation", "ecosystems", "MinION", "molecular taxonomy", "MPA", "sharks"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084824328", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"57207815162": {"Name": "Johri S.", "AuthorID": "57207815162", "AffiliationID": "60018926", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, San Diego State University"}, "57203708487": {"Name": "Block B.A.", "AuthorID": "57203708487", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Hopkins Marine Station, Stanford University"}, "6602355182": {"Name": "Dinsdale E.A.", "AuthorID": "6602355182", "AffiliationID": "60018926", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, San Diego State University"}, "57195986309": {"Name": "Dunn N.", "AuthorID": "57195986309", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London"}, "36552110800": {"Name": "Curnick D.", "AuthorID": "36552110800", "AffiliationID": "60009498, 60005453", "AffiliationName": "Zoological Society of London, Institute of Zoology"}, "7006741560": {"Name": "Savolainen V.", "AuthorID": "7006741560", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London"}, "36011573000": {"Name": "Chapple T.K.", "AuthorID": "36011573000", "AffiliationID": "60013402", "AffiliationName": "Coastal Oregon Marine Experiment Station, Oregon State University"}}}
