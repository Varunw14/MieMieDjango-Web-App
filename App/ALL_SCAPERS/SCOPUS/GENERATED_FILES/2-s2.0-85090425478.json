This paper, for the first time, presents a systematic study, experimental, theoretical and numerical, of shear behaviour of IPC beams reinforced with BFRP bars and stirrups considering the effects of stirrup spacing (S = 80, 100 and 150 mm) and shear span-to-depth ratio (\u03bb = 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5). Result indicates that all BFRP-IPC beams fail in shear as a result of BFRP stirrup rupture and shear-compression failure. Compared to S, \u03bb has a more pronounced influence on shear performance of BFRP reinforced IPC beams, with a maximum reduction of ultimate shear load by 29.4%. The simulation results show good agreement with experimental data, while the theoretical predictions according to existing design provisions for FRP reinforced concrete have a discrepancy of more than 30% with experiments due to lack of consideration of \u03bb. Modified equations taking into account the effect of \u03bb were then derived and used to predict the shear capacity of BFRP reinforced IPC beams, which agrees well with experimental data with an average discrepancy of only around 5%.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Finite element analysis", "FRP", "Geopolymer concrete", "Shear capacity", "Theoretical predictions"], "IndexKeywords": ["Design provisions", "Fibre reinforced polymers", "Modified equation", "Shear compression", "Shear performance", "Shear span-to-depth ratios", "Systematic study", "Ultimate shear loads"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090425478", "SubjectAreas": [["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"]], "AuthorData": {"7403393733": {"Name": "Fan X.", "AuthorID": "7403393733", "AffiliationID": "60022414", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Wuhan University of Technology"}, "57197737523": {"Name": "Zhou Z.", "AuthorID": "57197737523", "AffiliationID": "60022414", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Wuhan University of Technology"}, "57201474830": {"Name": "Tu W.", "AuthorID": "57201474830", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "24479149600": {"Name": "Zhang M.", "AuthorID": "24479149600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
