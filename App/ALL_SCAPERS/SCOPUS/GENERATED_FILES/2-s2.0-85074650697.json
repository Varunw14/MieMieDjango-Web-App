A recent study proposed that the acquisition of rotationally invariant DDE metrics, typically obtained using a spherical \u201c5-design,\u201d could be greatly simplified by assuming Gaussian diffusion, facilitating reduced acquisition times that are more compatible with clinical settings. Here, we aim to validate the new minimal acquisition scheme against the standard DDE 5-design, and to quantify the proposed method's noise robustness to facilitate future clinical use. Theory and Methods: DDE MRI experiments were performed on both ex vivo and in vivo rat brains at 9.4 T using the 5-design and the proposed minimal design and taking into account the difference in the number of acquisitions. The ensuing microscopic fractional anisotropy (\u03bcFA) maps were compared over a range of b-values up to 5000 s/mm2. Noise robustness was studied using analytical calculations and numerical simulations. Results: The minimal protocol quantified \u03bcFA at an accuracy comparable to the estimates obtained by means of the more theoretically robust DDE 5-design. \u03bcFA's sensitivity to noise was found to strongly depend on compartment anisotropy and tensor magnitude in a nonlinear manner. When \u03bcFA < 0.75 or when mean diffusivity is particularly low, very high signal-to-noise ratio is required for precise quantification of \u00b5FA. Conclusion: Our work supports using DDE for quantifying microscopic diffusion anisotropy in clinical settings but raises hitherto overlooked precision issues when measuring \u03bcFA with DDE and typical clinical signal-to-noise ratio.", "AuthorKeywords": ["diffusion", "double diffusion encoding", "microscopic anisotropy", "microstructure", "MRI", "rotationally invariant acquisitions"], "IndexKeywords": ["Analytical calculation", "Diffusion anisotropy", "Double diffusion", "Fractional Anisotropy", "Gaussian diffusion", "High signal-to-noise ratio", "Microscopic anisotropies", "Tissue microstructures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074650697", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57209651667": {"Name": "Kerkel\u00e4 L.", "AuthorID": "57209651667", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "56377599000": {"Name": "Hall M.G.", "AuthorID": "56377599000", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}, "55290679000": {"Name": "Clark C.A.", "AuthorID": "55290679000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57200203416": {"Name": "Henriques R.N.", "AuthorID": "57200203416", "AffiliationID": "60113882, 60113883", "AffiliationName": "Champalimaud Neuroscience Programme, Champalimaud Research, Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown"}, "25122041200": {"Name": "Shemesh N.", "AuthorID": "25122041200", "AffiliationID": "60113882, 60113883", "AffiliationName": "Champalimaud Neuroscience Programme, Champalimaud Research, Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown"}}}
