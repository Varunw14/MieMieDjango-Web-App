Data were analyzed by comparing patients who were referred (R) and not referred (NR) for PN. We identified 72 patients with 117 MBO admissions (mean \u00b1 SD age:63.1 \u00b1 13.1yrs, 79% female). 24/72 patients were in R group. Predominant primary malignancies were gynaecological and lower-gastrointestinal cancers (76%). 83% patients had metastases (61% sub-diaphragmatically). All patients were at high-risk of malnutrition and baseline mean weight loss was 7%. Discussion of PN at multidisciplinary team meeting (MDT) (22% vs.5%, P = 0.02) and dietetic contact (94% vs. 41%, P < 0.0001) were more likely to occur in the R group. In 13/69 MBO admissions in NR group, reasons for non-referral were unclear. Median baseline and follow-up weight was similar (55\u201355.8 kg). Overall survival was 4.7 (1.4\u201315.2)months, with no differences by referral groups. We compared a sub-sample of patients who \u2018may have\u2019 required PN (n = 10) vs. those discharged on home PN (n = 10) and found greater survival in the HPN group (323vs.91 day, P < 0.01). Our findings highlight disparity in care pathways suggesting that nutritional care should be integrated into clinical management discussion(s) at MDT to ensure equal access to nutritional services.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085518437", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"35316524300": {"Name": "Patel P.S.", "AuthorID": "35316524300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Dietetics Department, University College London Hospitals"}, "56089132100": {"Name": "Keane N.", "AuthorID": "56089132100", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Dietetics Department, University College London Hospitals"}, "57215505554": {"Name": "Fragkos K.C.", "AuthorID": "57215505554", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Intestinal Failure Service, University College London Hospitals"}, "57216944527": {"Name": "O\u2019Hanlon F.", "AuthorID": "57216944527", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Intestinal Failure Service, University College London Hospitals"}, "57211062270": {"Name": "Rogers J.", "AuthorID": "57211062270", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Intestinal Failure Service, University College London Hospitals"}, "57216950022": {"Name": "Obbard S.", "AuthorID": "57216950022", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Intestinal Failure Service, University College London Hospitals"}, "57205279533": {"Name": "Barragry J.", "AuthorID": "57205279533", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Intestinal Failure Service, University College London Hospitals"}, "55366728500": {"Name": "Sebepos-Rogers G.", "AuthorID": "55366728500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Intestinal Failure Service, University College London Hospitals"}, "56402425500": {"Name": "Mehta S.", "AuthorID": "56402425500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Intestinal Failure Service, University College London Hospitals"}, "12647293500": {"Name": "Rahman F.", "AuthorID": "12647293500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Intestinal Failure Service, University College London Hospitals"}, "6602354517": {"Name": "Di Caro S.", "AuthorID": "6602354517", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Intestinal Failure Service, University College London Hospitals"}, "57217930312": {"Name": "Cauldwell K.", "AuthorID": "57217930312", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Palliative Care Department, University College London Hospitals"}, "13611431700": {"Name": "Neerkin J.", "AuthorID": "13611431700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Palliative Care Department, University College London Hospitals"}}}
