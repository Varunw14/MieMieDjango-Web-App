Our aim was to determine the prevalence of UVP thrombosis (UVPT) and identify associated risk factors. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study on consecutive nonpregnant women attending our general gynecology clinic with a wide variety of presenting symptoms over a 16-month period. All women underwent a transvaginal ultrasound scan which involved detailed examination of the uterine venous plexus. Women diagnosed with incidental UVPT had thrombophilia screening, lower limb venous duplex imaging, and specialist hematological review. Logistic regression was used to examine associations between various risk factors and UVPT. Results: We screened 1383 women, 39 of whom had an incidental UVPT, giving a prevalence of 3.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1%-4.1%). Multivariate analysis showed positive associations between multiparity (odds ratio [OR] 5.75 [95% CI 2.10, 15.7]), recent surgery (OR 3.10 [95% CI 1.19, 8.07]), presence of leg varicose veins (OR 3.15 [95% CI 1.32, 7.49]), and a family history of venous thromboembolism (OR 8.74 [1.65, 46.4]) and negative associations between postmenopausal status (OR 0.36 [95% CI 0.13, 0.95]) and the development of UVPT. Thrombophilia was detected in 12.8% women diagnosed with UVPT. Conclusions: The prevalence of incidental UVPT in a general gynecology population was 3.0%. Several demographic and clinical factors were found to be associated with UVPT. This could help to identify women at risk of this condition, and facilitate its early detection and development of evidence-based management strategies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["deep vein thrombosis", "prevalence", "ultrasound", "uterine venous plexus thrombosis", "venous thromboembolism"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089247455", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"7003807183": {"Name": "Amin T.", "AuthorID": "7003807183", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57218456723": {"Name": "Wong M.", "AuthorID": "57218456723", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57202829335": {"Name": "Goodhart V.", "AuthorID": "57202829335", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57210373676": {"Name": "Pointer S.L.", "AuthorID": "57210373676", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004871743": {"Name": "Jurkovic D.", "AuthorID": "7004871743", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7402809618": {"Name": "Cohen H.", "AuthorID": "7402809618", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Haemostasis Research Unit, Department of Haematology, University College London"}}}
