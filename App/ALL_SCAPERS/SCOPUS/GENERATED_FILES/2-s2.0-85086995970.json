However, different gate dependence of the coupling strength has been reported in experiments. On the theoretical side, it has been predicted that the largest Rashba effect appears at the crossing point of the dxy and dxz,yz bands. In this work, we study the tunability of the Rashba effect in LaAlO3/SrTiO3 by means of backgating. The Lifshitz transition was crossed multiple times by tuning the gate voltage so that the Fermi energy is tuned to approach or depart from the band crossing. By analyzing the weak antilocalization behavior in the magnetoresistance, we find that the maximum spin-orbit coupling effect occurs when the Fermi energy is near the Lifshitz point. Moreover, we find strong evidence for a single spin winding at the Fermi surface.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Coupling strengths", "Gate dependence", "Lifshitz points", "Lifshitz transition", "Rashba spin-orbit coupling", "Spin-orbit coupling effects", "Spintronic device", "Weak antilocalization"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086995970", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"55443113700": {"Name": "Yin C.", "AuthorID": "55443113700", "AffiliationID": "60084229, 60019816", "AffiliationName": "Huygens-Kamerlingh Onnes Laboratory, Leiden University"}, "57193764584": {"Name": "Lebedev N.", "AuthorID": "57193764584", "AffiliationID": "60084229, 60019816", "AffiliationName": "Huygens-Kamerlingh Onnes Laboratory, Leiden University"}, "55867175100": {"Name": "Aarts J.", "AuthorID": "55867175100", "AffiliationID": "60084229, 60019816", "AffiliationName": "Huygens-Kamerlingh Onnes Laboratory, Leiden University"}, "57201195432": {"Name": "Seiler P.", "AuthorID": "57201195432", "AffiliationID": "60016060", "AffiliationName": "Center for Electronic Correlations and Magnetism, EP VI, Institute of Physics, University of Augsburg"}, "57200687307": {"Name": "Tang L.M.K.", "AuthorID": "57200687307", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "High Field Magnet Laboratory (HFML-EMFL), Radboud University"}, "56650937000": {"Name": "Leermakers I.", "AuthorID": "56650937000", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "High Field Magnet Laboratory (HFML-EMFL), Radboud University"}, "7003480713": {"Name": "Zeitler U.", "AuthorID": "7003480713", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "High Field Magnet Laboratory (HFML-EMFL), Radboud University"}}}
