Accurate prediction of optimal treatment beneficial and adverse effects could transform patient management. This is of particular importance in chronic conditions, where a \u2018trial and error\u2019 approach over months and years can contribute to significant morbidity. Glaucoma is a chronic irreversible progressive optic neuropathy, a leading cause of blindness worldwide. An ideal personalized approach in glaucoma clinic would be to answer the inevitable question in a patient\u2019s first visit: \u2018Which treatment option will work best for me so that I won\u2019t go blind?\u2019 Areas covered: This review will give an overview of the knowledge we have acquired to achieve this goal, particularly discussing using patient\u2019s individual risk factors, their genetic profile, and different treatment modalities, including therapy compliance, to personalize care. Expert opinion: Pharmacogenomics and genetic profiling are the most tangible ways in which glaucoma management can be personalized. Future challenges will include developing realistic animal models to reflect the underlying genetic patterns in glaucoma to investigate their interaction with different treatments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["personalization", "pharamacogenetics", "pharmacogenomics"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084815325", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"56893716200": {"Name": "Balendra S.I.", "AuthorID": "56893716200", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Glaucoma and Retinal Neurodegeneration Group, Department of Visual Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57210287162": {"Name": "Cordeiro M.F.", "AuthorID": "57210287162", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Glaucoma and Retinal Neurodegeneration Group, Department of Visual Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57216541367": {"Name": "Zollet P.", "AuthorID": "57216541367", "AffiliationID": "60009622, 60082964", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University Vita-Salute San Raffaele, San Raffaele Scientific Institute"}, "57216818787": {"Name": "Cisa Asinari Di Gresy E Casasca G.", "AuthorID": "57216818787", "AffiliationID": "60009622, 60082964", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University Vita-Salute San Raffaele, San Raffaele Scientific Institute"}}}
