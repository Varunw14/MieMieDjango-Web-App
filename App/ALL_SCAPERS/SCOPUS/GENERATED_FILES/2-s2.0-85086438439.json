Via the coupling between two stub resonators, PIT is introduced due to the destructive interference, which can be theoretically described by the transmission-line method. Meanwhile, the strong dispersion within the transparent window will lead to the slow light effect. Via tuning the geometric parameters, the profile of PIT as well as group delay line can be arbitrarily tailored. Moreover, active control of both PIT and slow light can be realized by changing the ambient temperature. Especially, by integrating monolayer graphene into the structure, PIT and slow light can also be electrically modulated via applying voltage. This work provides geometrical, thermal and electrical approaches to manipulate THz transmission and group delay in the subwavelength scale, and can find potential applications as filters, sensors, modulators and active optical delay lines in THz ultracompact circuits.", "AuthorKeywords": ["graphene", "plasmon-induced transparency", "plasmonic waveguide", "slow light", "terahertz"], "IndexKeywords": ["Destructive interference", "Induced transparency", "Optical delay lines", "Plasmonic waveguides", "Semiconductor waveguide", "Strong dispersion", "Subwavelength scale", "Transmission line methods"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086438439", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"]], "AuthorData": {"57197772732": {"Name": "Zhang Z.", "AuthorID": "57197772732", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, National University of Defense Technology"}, "56732089500": {"Name": "Huang J.", "AuthorID": "56732089500", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57013633200": {"Name": "Chen D.", "AuthorID": "57013633200", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, National University of Defense Technology"}, "16023467700": {"Name": "Yang J.", "AuthorID": "16023467700", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "Center of Material Science, National University of Defense Technology"}, "55491491300": {"Name": "He X.", "AuthorID": "55491491300", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "Center of Material Science, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57192831289": {"Name": "Han Y.", "AuthorID": "57192831289", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "Center of Material Science, National University of Defense Technology"}}}
