This signal can also be used by artificial intelligence (AI) methods to provide support in identifying instruments, structures, or activities both in real-time during procedures and postoperatively for analytics and understanding of surgical processes. Summary: In this paper, we provide a succinct perspective on the use of AI and especially computer vision to power solutions for the surgical operating room (OR). The synergy between data availability and technical advances in computational power and AI methodology has led to rapid developments in the field and promising advances. Key Messages: With the increasing availability of surgical video sources and the convergence of technologiesaround video storage, processing, and understanding, we believe clinical solutions and products leveraging vision are going to become an important component of modern surgical capabilities. However, both technical and clinical challenges remain to be overcome to efficiently make use of vision-based approaches into the clinic.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094655763", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"55367064500": {"Name": "Chadebecq F.", "AuthorID": "55367064500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences (WEISS), University College London"}, "47862298300": {"Name": "Vasconcelos F.", "AuthorID": "47862298300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences (WEISS), University College London"}, "35097627900": {"Name": "Mazomenos E.", "AuthorID": "35097627900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences (WEISS), University College London"}, "57203105770": {"Name": "Stoyanov D.", "AuthorID": "57203105770", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences (WEISS), University College London"}}}
