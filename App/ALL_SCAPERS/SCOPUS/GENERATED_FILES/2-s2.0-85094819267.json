In this article, we formulate and discuss three types of DMPT, with two of them based only on density matrices: the approach of Kussmann and Ochsenfeld [J. Chem. Phys. 127, 054103 (2007)] is reformulated via the Sylvester equation and the recursive DMPT of Niklasson and Challacombe [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 193001 (2004)] is extended to the hole-particle canonical purification (HPCP) from Truflandier et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 144, 091102 (2016)]. A comparison of the computational performances shows that the aforementioned methods outperform the standard SOS. The HPCP-DMPT demonstrates stable convergence profiles but at a higher computational cost when compared to the original recursive polynomial method.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Computational costs", "Computational performance", "Density-matrix perturbation theory", "Input variables", "Perturbation theory", "Recursive polynomials", "Stable convergence", "Sylvester equation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094819267", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"16834204500": {"Name": "Truflandier L.A.", "AuthorID": "16834204500", "AffiliationID": "60102125, 60106844", "AffiliationName": "Institut des Sciences Mol\u00e9culaires (ISM), Universit\u00e9 Bordeaux"}, "57164883300": {"Name": "Dianzinga R.M.", "AuthorID": "57164883300", "AffiliationID": "60102125, 60106844", "AffiliationName": "Institut des Sciences Mol\u00e9culaires (ISM), Universit\u00e9 Bordeaux"}, "7006156424": {"Name": "Bowler D.R.", "AuthorID": "7006156424", "AffiliationID": "60002414", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Materials Nanoarchitechtonics (MANA), National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS)"}}}
