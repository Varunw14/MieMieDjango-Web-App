DESIGN: Multicentre observational study. SETTING: Fifty medical departments at 14 (academic and non-academic) hospitals in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred sixty-five physicians (71.6% response rate), comprising 385 (82.8%) medical specialists and 80 (17.2%) residents. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Job demands (workload and bureaucratic demands), job resources (participation in decision making, development opportunities, leader's inspiration, relationships with colleagues and patients)-measured with the validated Questionnaire of Experience and Evaluation of Work and Physician Worklife Survey-and patient-related burnout, measured using the validated Copenhagen Burnout Inventory. RESULTS: Patient-related burnout was positively associated with workload (b=0.36; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.48; p<0.001) and negatively associated with development opportunities (b=-0.18; 95% CI, -0.27 to -0.08; p<0.001) and relationships with patients (b=-0.12; 95% CI, -0.22 to -0.03; p=0.01). Relationships with patients moderated the association between bureaucratic demands and patient-related burnout (b=-0.15; 95% CI, -0.27 to -0.04; p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Physicians with high workloads and few development opportunities reported higher levels of patient-related burnout. Those with positive patient relationships were less likely to experience patient-related burnout, even in the presence of excessive bureaucracy. Therefore, positive physician-patient relationships may be supported to reduce the likelihood of physicians' patient-related burnout. However, the specific support needed to effectively reduce patient-related burnout may vary per healthcare context and thus requires intensified research across healthcare systems and settings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["health policy", "human resource management", "medical education & training", "quality in health care"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091616135", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"56178334900": {"Name": "Scheepers R.", "AuthorID": "56178334900", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "Medical Psychology, Amsterdam University Medical Centres"}, "6507621988": {"Name": "Lombarts K.", "AuthorID": "6507621988", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "Medical Psychology, Amsterdam University Medical Centres"}, "56922277800": {"Name": "Silkens M.", "AuthorID": "56922277800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Medical Education, University College London"}, "56645816600": {"Name": "van den Berg J.", "AuthorID": "56645816600", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "Internal Medicine, Amsterdam University Medical Centres"}}}
