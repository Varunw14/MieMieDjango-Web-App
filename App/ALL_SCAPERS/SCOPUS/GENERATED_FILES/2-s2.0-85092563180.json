Objectives: The aim of this study was to study the multimodal brain MRI alterations in MOGAD and to investigate their clinical significance. Methods: A total of 17 MOGAD, 20 aquaporin-4 antibody seropositive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (AQP4 + NMOSD), and 28 healthy controls (HC) were prospectively recruited. Voxel-wise gray matter (GM) volume, fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and degree centrality (DC) were compared between groups. Clinical associations and differential diagnosis were determined using partial correlation and stepwise logistic regression. Results: In comparison with HC, MOGAD had GM atrophy in frontal and temporal lobe, insula, thalamus, and hippocampus, and WM fiber disruption in optic radiation and anterior/posterior corona radiata; DC decreased in cerebellum and increased in temporal lobe. Compared to AQP4 + NMOSD, MOGAD presented lower GM volume in postcentral gyrus and decreased DC in cerebellum. Hippocampus/parahippocampus atrophy associated with Expanded Disability Status Scale (R = \u22120.55, p = 0.04) and California Verbal Learning Test (R = 0.62, p = 0.031). The differentiation of MOGAD from AQP4 + NMOSD achieved an accuracy of 95% using FA in splenium of corpus callosum and DC in occipital gyrus. Conclusion: Distinct structural and functional alterations were identified in MOGAD. Hippocampus/parahippocampus atrophy associated with clinical disability and cognitive impairment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["degree centrality", "fractional anisotropy", "gray matter volume", "mean diffusivity", "multimodal MRI", "Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein associated disease"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092563180", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55913594600": {"Name": "Zhuo Z.", "AuthorID": "55913594600", "AffiliationID": "60073452", "AffiliationName": "Tiantan Image Research Center, China National Clinical Research Center for Neurological Diseases"}, "13610637600": {"Name": "Duan Y.", "AuthorID": "13610637600", "AffiliationID": "60073452", "AffiliationName": "Tiantan Image Research Center, China National Clinical Research Center for Neurological Diseases"}, "23668203500": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "23668203500", "AffiliationID": "60073452", "AffiliationName": "Tiantan Image Research Center, China National Clinical Research Center for Neurological Diseases"}, "56865334200": {"Name": "Tian D.", "AuthorID": "56865334200", "AffiliationID": "60026707", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Innovation Center for Human Brain Protection, Capital Medical University"}, "57217852633": {"Name": "Wang X.", "AuthorID": "57217852633", "AffiliationID": "60011715", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Tianjin Neurological Institute, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital"}, "57219404147": {"Name": "Gao C.", "AuthorID": "57219404147", "AffiliationID": "60073452, 60026707", "AffiliationName": "Center for Neurology, Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University"}, "9044766400": {"Name": "Zhang X.", "AuthorID": "9044766400", "AffiliationID": "60073452, 60026707", "AffiliationName": "Center for Neurology, Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University"}, "57216491095": {"Name": "Ding J.", "AuthorID": "57216491095", "AffiliationID": "60073452, 60026707", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University"}, "57200378045": {"Name": "Zheng F.", "AuthorID": "57200378045", "AffiliationID": "60073452, 60026707", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University"}, "57219401770": {"Name": "Zhang T.", "AuthorID": "57219401770", "AffiliationID": "60112652", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Beijing Bo\u2019ai Hospital, China Rehabilitation Research Center"}, "57204594265": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "57204594265", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Queen Square Institute of Neurology and Center for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "7202739770": {"Name": "Shi F.D.", "AuthorID": "7202739770", "AffiliationID": "60011715", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Tianjin Neurological Institute, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital"}}}
