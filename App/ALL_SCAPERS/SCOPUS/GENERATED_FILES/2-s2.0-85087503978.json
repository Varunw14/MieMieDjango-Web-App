The passivation of mild steel in MKPC pore solutions was investigated in this study via electrochemical measurements, XPS and Raman spectroscopy. Results show that the passivity of mild steel in MKPC was comparable or even better than that in Portland cement. Although the passivity was dominated by the pH of MKPC, it also increases with increasing magnesium-to-phosphate (M/P) ratios. The formation of iron phosphate in the low pH MKPC (such as M/P 7) also made additional contributions to the passivity of steel.", "AuthorKeywords": ["M/P ratio", "Mild steel", "Passivity", "Phosphate", "Raman spectroscopy", "XPS"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electrochemical measurements", "Iron phosphates", "Magnesium potassium phosphate cements", "Magnesium potassium phosphates", "Pore solution"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087503978", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57015887600": {"Name": "Wang D.", "AuthorID": "57015887600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Advanced & Innovative Materials (AIM) Group, Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "57217680301": {"Name": "Mi T.", "AuthorID": "57217680301", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Advanced & Innovative Materials (AIM) Group, Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "57217687228": {"Name": "Yang S.", "AuthorID": "57217687228", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Advanced & Innovative Materials (AIM) Group, Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "55938748100": {"Name": "McCague C.", "AuthorID": "55938748100", "AffiliationID": "124728824", "AffiliationName": "Mineral Products Association"}, "55461062100": {"Name": "Bai Y.", "AuthorID": "55461062100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Advanced & Innovative Materials (AIM) Group, Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "55758857700": {"Name": "Yue Y.", "AuthorID": "55758857700", "AffiliationID": "60023380", "AffiliationName": "College of Materials Science and Engineering, Chongqing University"}, "54399201500": {"Name": "Qian J.", "AuthorID": "54399201500", "AffiliationID": "60023380", "AffiliationName": "College of Materials Science and Engineering, Chongqing University"}}}
