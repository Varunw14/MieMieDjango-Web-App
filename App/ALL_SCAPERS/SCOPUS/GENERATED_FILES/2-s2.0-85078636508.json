Methods: A double-blind randomized controlled cross-over design. Part 1. Behavioural measures of tinnitus following 30mg MDMA or placebo administration (N=5 participants) and Part 2. Behavioural measures of tinnitus and correlations between pairs of apriori regions of interest (ROI) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) before and after 70mg of MDMA or placebo (N=8 participants). Results: The results to MDMA were similar to placebo. For the 70mg dose, there was a significant reduction after 4h in annoyance and ignore ratings. RsMRI showed decreased connectivity compared with placebo administration between the left hippocampal, right hippocampal, left amygdala and right amygdala regions, and between the right posterior parahippocampal cortex and the left amygdala after two hours of 70mg MDMA administration. Increased connectivity compared to placebo administration was found post MDMA between the right post-central gyrus and right posterior and superior temporal gyrus, and between the thalamus and frontoparietal network. Conclusions: Following 70mg of MDMA two tinnitus rating scales significantly improved. There was, however, a placebo effect. Compared with placebo the rsMRI following the MDMA showed reductions in connectivity between the amygdala, hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus. There is sufficient proof of concept to support future investigation of MDMA as a treatment for tinnitus.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine", "rs-MRI", "Tinnitus", "treatment"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078636508", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"6506808384": {"Name": "Searchfield G.D.", "AuthorID": "6506808384", "AffiliationID": "108297220", "AffiliationName": "Brain Research New Zealand"}, "56611823000": {"Name": "Durai M.", "AuthorID": "56611823000", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Brain Research, The University of Auckland"}, "57214322580": {"Name": "Park J.", "AuthorID": "57214322580", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Eisdell Moore Centre & Audiology Section, The University of Auckland"}, "55203325700": {"Name": "Spiegel D.", "AuthorID": "55203325700", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Eisdell Moore Centre & Audiology Section, The University of Auckland"}, "57197876398": {"Name": "Poppe T.N.E.R.", "AuthorID": "57197876398", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, Kings College London"}, "35086209000": {"Name": "Jensen M.", "AuthorID": "35086209000", "AffiliationID": "60005686, 60006794", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacy, Whakatane Hospital, Bay of Plenty, School of Pharmacy, University of Auckland"}, "7402308712": {"Name": "Kennedy M.A.", "AuthorID": "7402308712", "AffiliationID": "60017311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Biomedical Science, University of Otago"}, "36802026200": {"Name": "Maggo S.", "AuthorID": "36802026200", "AffiliationID": "60017311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Biomedical Science, University of Otago"}, "55553732097": {"Name": "Miller A.L.", "AuthorID": "55553732097", "AffiliationID": "60017311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Biomedical Science, University of Otago"}, "7202346408": {"Name": "Russell B.R.", "AuthorID": "7202346408", "AffiliationID": "60017311", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University of Otago"}, "56087344000": {"Name": "Shekhawat G.S.", "AuthorID": "56087344000", "AffiliationID": "60023760", "AffiliationName": "Auckland University of Technology"}, "24340438700": {"Name": "Wise K.", "AuthorID": "24340438700", "AffiliationID": "60023760", "AffiliationName": "Auckland University of Technology"}, "35727070700": {"Name": "Sundram F.", "AuthorID": "35727070700", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Medicine, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, The University of Auckland"}}}
