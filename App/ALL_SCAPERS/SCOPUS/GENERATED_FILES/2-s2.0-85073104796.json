The attenuation and activity distributions were reconstructed from multiple energy window data, and a scatter function was added to the system model of the algorithm. The proposed energy-based method (MLAA-EB) was evaluated with simulated 3D phantom data, using the geometry and characteristics of a Siemens mMR PET-MR scanner. Results showed that the proposed algorithm is able to compensate for errors in the activity image caused by the incorrect assignment of attenuation values to the segmented MR. This is effective for small objects only, for large objects further solutions need to be found.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Activity distribution", "Energy information", "Energy window measurements", "Energy windows", "Energy-based methods", "Maximum-likelihood reconstruction", "Scatter functions", "System modeling"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073104796", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"]], "AuthorData": {"6505781416": {"Name": "Brusaferri L.", "AuthorID": "6505781416", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "15842886700": {"Name": "Bousse A.", "AuthorID": "15842886700", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "35621323500": {"Name": "Tsai Y.J.", "AuthorID": "35621323500", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "23480655200": {"Name": "Thielemans K.", "AuthorID": "23480655200", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "57210526592": {"Name": "Atkinson D.", "AuthorID": "57210526592", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57203050071": {"Name": "Hutton B.F.", "AuthorID": "57203050071", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005759823": {"Name": "Arridge S.", "AuthorID": "7005759823", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
