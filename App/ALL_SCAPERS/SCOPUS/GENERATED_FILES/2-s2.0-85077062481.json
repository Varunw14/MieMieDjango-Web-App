This multi-module approach is made possible thanks to novel network architectures, allowing for in-body power and data communications to be performed using implantable leads. This paper discusses the challenges in implementing such interfacing system and presents a platform based on one central implant (CI) and multiple peripheral implants (PIs) using a custom 4WiCS communication protocol. This is implemented in PCB technology and tested to demonstrate intrabody communication capabilities and power transfer within the network. Measured results show CI-To-PI power delivery achieves 70 % efficiency in expected load condition, while establishing full-duplex data link with up to 4 PIs simultaneously.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Data-communication", "Distributed technologies", "Implantable medical devices", "Implantable microsystems", "Intra-body communications", "Measured results", "Pcb technologies", "Power transfers"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077062481", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"57194787112": {"Name": "Haci D.", "AuthorID": "57194787112", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College, Centre for Bio-Inspired Technology"}, "57202970101": {"Name": "Mifsud A.", "AuthorID": "57202970101", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College, Centre for Bio-Inspired Technology"}, "56029027900": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "56029027900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College, Centre for Bio-Inspired Technology"}, "37661295700": {"Name": "Ghoreishizadeh S.S.", "AuthorID": "37661295700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College, Centre for Bio-Inspired Technology"}, "6602214504": {"Name": "Constandinou T.G.", "AuthorID": "6602214504", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College, Centre for Bio-Inspired Technology"}}}
