Although many biochemical signaling molecules have been used, their biological functions in vivo are known to be limited, mainly due to their short lifetime and poor activity. Matrices (or engineered biomaterials), beyond the biochemical signals, play pivotal roles in stimulating angiogenic processes. Here we discuss the proangiogenic effort taken to repair and regenerate various tissues including skin, bone, muscle and nerve, focusing on the roles of engineered matrices. This includes the design of pore structure and physico-chemical properties (nanotopology, stiffness, chemistry and degradability), the tailoring of matrices for proper presentation of growth factors and their crosstalks with adhesion ligands, the controlled and sustained delivery of angiogenic molecules and metallic ions, and the engineering of cells and construction of prevascularized tissues. Collectively, the materials-driven strategies are envisaged to tune the cell and tissue microenvironments where angiogenic events can be significantly favored through the matrix cues and properly presented or delivered signaling molecules and cells.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Angiogenesis", "Cell engineering", "Delivery", "Materials properties", "Tissue regeneration"], "IndexKeywords": ["Angiogenic molecule", "Angiogenic process", "Biochemical signal", "Biological functions", "Engineered biomaterials", "Microenvironments", "Signaling molecules", "Tissue engineered constructs"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090974236", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57202882008": {"Name": "Lee J.H.", "AuthorID": "57202882008", "AffiliationID": "60002877", "AffiliationName": "Cell & Matter Institute, Dankook University"}, "57218994502": {"Name": "Parthiban P.", "AuthorID": "57218994502", "AffiliationID": "60170569, 60002877", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Tissue Regeneration Engineering (ITREN), Dankook University"}, "27171822300": {"Name": "Jin G.Z.", "AuthorID": "27171822300", "AffiliationID": "60002877", "AffiliationName": "Cell & Matter Institute, Dankook University"}, "26643634100": {"Name": "Knowles J.C.", "AuthorID": "26643634100", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "57211729840": {"Name": "Kim H.W.", "AuthorID": "57211729840", "AffiliationID": "60002877", "AffiliationName": "Cell & Matter Institute, Dankook University"}}}
