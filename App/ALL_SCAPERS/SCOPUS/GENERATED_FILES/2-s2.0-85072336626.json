To fully leverage this new technology, and in particular its capacity for mobility, the activity of deep brain structures which facilitate explorative behaviours such as navigation, must be detectable using OP-MEG. One such crucial brain region is the hippocampus. Here we had three healthy adult participants perform a hippocampal-dependent task \u2013 the imagination of novel scene imagery \u2013 while being scanned using OP-MEG. A conjunction analysis across these three participants revealed a significant change in theta power in the medial temporal lobe. The peak of this activated cluster was located in the anterior hippocampus. We repeated the experiment with the same participants in a conventional SQUID-MEG scanner and found similar engagement of the medial temporal lobe, also with a peak in the anterior hippocampus. These OP-MEG findings indicate exciting new opportunities for investigating the neural correlates of a range of crucial cognitive functions in naturalistic contexts including spatial navigation, episodic memory and social interactions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hippocampus", "Imagination", "Magnetoencephalography", "Optically-pumped magnetometers", "Scene construction", "Source localisation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Female", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Imagination", "Magnetoencephalography", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Movement", "Spatial Processing", "Theta Rhythm"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072336626", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"36908712800": {"Name": "Barry D.N.", "AuthorID": "36908712800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "56921739000": {"Name": "Tierney T.M.", "AuthorID": "56921739000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7202142345": {"Name": "Barnes G.R.", "AuthorID": "7202142345", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7005945840": {"Name": "Maguire E.A.", "AuthorID": "7005945840", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57201420913": {"Name": "Holmes N.", "AuthorID": "57201420913", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham, University Park"}, "57191490424": {"Name": "Boto E.", "AuthorID": "57191490424", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham, University Park"}, "57201428018": {"Name": "Roberts G.", "AuthorID": "57201428018", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham, University Park"}, "57197534488": {"Name": "Leggett J.", "AuthorID": "57197534488", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham, University Park"}, "7005010989": {"Name": "Bowtell R.", "AuthorID": "7005010989", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham, University Park"}, "8599486300": {"Name": "Brookes M.J.", "AuthorID": "8599486300", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham, University Park"}}}
