Data came from 60 transcripts of clinical sessions that were part of a conversation-based intervention designed to teach them pronouns, verbs, and verb inflections. The results showed that, when presented alone, interrogative choice and declarative recasts led to the highest rates of child repair. The results also showed that when children were presented with recasts and prompts to repair, the rate of repair increased. Spontaneous use of linguistic targets was significantly and positively related to conversational sequences where the adult recast was followed by child repair. These findings suggest that using different recast types and prompts to repair may be beneficial for spontaneous use of linguistic targets in this population.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AAC", "adult input", "recast"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Apraxias", "Cerebral Palsy", "Child", "Communication Aids for Disabled", "Female", "Humans", "Language", "Language Development", "Linguistics", "Male", "Speech", "Speech Disorders", "Vocabulary"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072288228", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"7006726088": {"Name": "Soto G.", "AuthorID": "7006726088", "AffiliationID": "60027627", "AffiliationName": "Department of Speech, Hearing and Language Sciences, San Francisco State University"}, "7403283929": {"Name": "Clarke M.T.", "AuthorID": "7403283929", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Language and Cognition, University College"}, "7403228219": {"Name": "Nelson K.", "AuthorID": "7403228219", "AffiliationID": "60001439", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Pennsylvania State University"}, "57211018372": {"Name": "Starowicz R.", "AuthorID": "57211018372", "AffiliationID": "60027627", "AffiliationName": "Joint Doctoral Program in Special Education, San Francisco State University"}, "57203887060": {"Name": "Savaldi-Harussi G.", "AuthorID": "57203887060", "AffiliationID": "60027627", "AffiliationName": "Joint Doctoral Program in Special Education, San Francisco State University"}}}
