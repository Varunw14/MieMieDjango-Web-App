Objectives: We evaluated whether implementing higher diagnostic thresholds than currently recommended for QuantiFERON Gold-in-Tube (QFT-GIT), T-SPOT.TB, and the tuberculin skin test (TST) might improve prediction of incident TB. Methods: Follow-up of a UK cohort of 9,610 adult TB contacts and recent migrants was extended by relinkage to national TB surveillance records (median follow-up 4.7 yr). Incidence rates and rate ratios, sensitivities, specificities, and predictive values for incident TB were calculated according to ordinal strata for quantitative results of QFT-GIT, T-SPOT.TB, and TST (with adjustment for prior bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin [BCG] vaccination). Measurements and Main Results: For all tests, incidence rates and rate ratios increased with the magnitude of the test result (P < 0.0001). Over 3 years\u2019 follow-up, there was a modest increase in positive predictive value with the higher thresholds (3.0% for QFT-GIT \u22650.35 IU/ml vs. 3.6% for \u22654.00 IU/ml; 3.4% for T-SPOT.TB \u22655 spots vs. 5.0% for \u226550 spots; and 3.1% for BCG-adjusted TST \u22655 mm vs. 4.3% for \u226515 mm). As thresholds increased, sensitivity to detect incident TB waned for all tests (61.0% for QFT-GIT \u22650.35 IU/ml vs. 23.2% for \u22654.00 IU/ml; 65.4% for T-SPOT.TB \u22655 spots vs. 27.2% for \u226550 spots; 69.7% for BCG-adjusted TST \u22655 mm vs. 28.1% for \u226515 mm). Conclusions: Implementation of higher thresholds for QFT-GIT, T-SPOT.TB, and TST modestly increases positive predictive value for incident TB, but markedly reduces sensitivity. Novel biomarkers or validated multivariable risk algorithms are required to improve prediction of incident TB.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Epidemiology", "Latent tuberculosis", "QuantiFERON", "Screening", "T-SPOT.TB"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Incidence", "Interferon-gamma Release Tests", "Latent Tuberculosis", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prospective Studies", "Tuberculin Test", "Tuberculosis", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081720920", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"]], "AuthorData": {"56645308000": {"Name": "Gupta R.K.", "AuthorID": "56645308000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "55057756400": {"Name": "Jackson C.", "AuthorID": "55057756400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "56333656200": {"Name": "Stirrup O.", "AuthorID": "56333656200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "6602338051": {"Name": "Abubakar I.", "AuthorID": "6602338051", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "57195311478": {"Name": "Lipman M.", "AuthorID": "57195311478", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust"}, "57195363908": {"Name": "Noursadeghi M.", "AuthorID": "57195363908", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "37007688500": {"Name": "Sitch A.J.", "AuthorID": "37007688500", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham"}, "7006087510": {"Name": "Deeks J.J.", "AuthorID": "7006087510", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham"}, "35546455500": {"Name": "Southern J.", "AuthorID": "35546455500", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Tuberculosis Unit, Public Health England"}, "57202358582": {"Name": "Tsou C.Y.", "AuthorID": "57202358582", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Tuberculosis Unit, Public Health England"}, "57145973300": {"Name": "Davidson J.", "AuthorID": "57145973300", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Tuberculosis Unit, Public Health England"}, "56270793500": {"Name": "Campbell C.", "AuthorID": "56270793500", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Tuberculosis Unit, Public Health England"}, "57203030116": {"Name": "Drobniewski F.", "AuthorID": "57203030116", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Section of Infectious Diseases and Immunity and Imperial College"}, "57195801728": {"Name": "Lalvani A.", "AuthorID": "57195801728", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Tuberculosis Research Centre, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College"}, "55228809500": {"Name": "Griffiths C.", "AuthorID": "55228809500", "AffiliationID": "124601997", "AffiliationName": "Barts Institute of Population Health Sciences"}, "7006278523": {"Name": "Kunst H.", "AuthorID": "7006278523", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "16241387400": {"Name": "Haldar P.", "AuthorID": "16241387400", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory Biomedical Research Centre, Institute for Lung Health, Department of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, University of Leicester"}}}
