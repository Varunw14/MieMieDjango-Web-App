Here, we present a detailed description of this specimen, as well as an emended diagnosis for this titanosaur. Savannasaurus elliottorum displays numerous character states that are generally regarded as plesiomorphic for Titanosauria, as well as several traits that are often regarded as apomorphic of that clade or a less inclusive subset thereof. Several features of Savannasaurus support a close relationship with the coeval Diamantinasaurus matildae, and this clade appears to occupy an early-branching position within Titanosauria. Relative to body size, the thoracic and abdominal breadth of Savannasaurus is greater than that seen in giant titanosaurs such as the contemporaneous South American lognkosaurians; however, this relative breadth is not quite as extreme as that of the small-bodied latest Cretaceous saltasaurines, or Opisthocoelicaudia skarzynskii. The possible advantages engendered by the barrel-shaped thorax, robust limbs, wide-gauge gait, and lack of hyposphene-hypantrum articulations are explored, and it is hypothesized that these traits were positively selected by the wet, temperate floodplain environment in which Savannasaurus lived. Greater stability and flexibility might have reduced the risk of bogging, and/or facilitated more expedient self-extraction from muddy waterholes. Similar environmental pressures acting upon other titanosaurian taxa or clades elsewhere might have led to the repeated independent development, or accentuation, of the bauplan regarded as \u2018typical\u2019 for the clade Titanosauria. This would explain the many observed convergences between Savannasaurus and Diamantinasaurus, and Saltasauridae.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091733303", "SubjectAreas": [["Paleontology", "EART", "1911"]], "AuthorData": {"55303660600": {"Name": "Poropat S.F.", "AuthorID": "55303660600", "AffiliationID": "123258906", "AffiliationName": "Australian Age of Dinosaurs Museum of Natural History, The Jump-Up"}, "27068100100": {"Name": "Tischler T.R.", "AuthorID": "27068100100", "AffiliationID": "123258906", "AffiliationName": "Australian Age of Dinosaurs Museum of Natural History, The Jump-Up"}, "27067937000": {"Name": "Sloan T.", "AuthorID": "27067937000", "AffiliationID": "123258906", "AffiliationName": "Australian Age of Dinosaurs Museum of Natural History, The Jump-Up"}, "55266275400": {"Name": "Sinapius G.H.K.", "AuthorID": "55266275400", "AffiliationID": "123258906", "AffiliationName": "Australian Age of Dinosaurs Museum of Natural History, The Jump-Up"}, "57191663284": {"Name": "Elliott J.A.", "AuthorID": "57191663284", "AffiliationID": "123258906", "AffiliationName": "Australian Age of Dinosaurs Museum of Natural History, The Jump-Up"}, "36630211300": {"Name": "Elliott D.A.", "AuthorID": "36630211300", "AffiliationID": "123258906", "AffiliationName": "Australian Age of Dinosaurs Museum of Natural History, The Jump-Up"}, "25632385300": {"Name": "Mannion P.D.", "AuthorID": "25632385300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "6701733955": {"Name": "Upchurch P.", "AuthorID": "6701733955", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}}}
