Methods We included all employees residing in Denmark in 2000, aged 30\u201359 years with no prevalent CHD (N=1 660 150). We determined exposure to job strain from 1996\u20132009 using a job exposure matrix (JEM) with annual updates. Follow-up for incident CHD was from 2001\u20132010 via linkage to health records. We used Cox regression to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between job strain and incident CHD. Results During 16.1 million person-years, we identified 24 159 incident CHD cases (15.0 per 10 000 personyears). After adjustment for covariates, job strain in 2000 predicted onset of CHD during a mean follow-up of 9.71 years (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.07\u20131.13). When analyzing changes in job strain from one year to the next and CHD in the subsequent year, persistent job strain (HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.03\u20131.10), onset of job strain (HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.12\u20131.29) and removal of strain (HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.12\u20131.28) were associated with higher CHD incidence compared to persistent no job strain. Associations were similar among men and women. Conclusions Job strain is associated with a higher risk of incident CHD in Denmark. As we used a JEM, we can rule out reporting bias. However, under-or overestimation of associations is possible due to non-differential misclassification of job strain and residual confounding by socioeconomic position.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CHD", "Epidemiology", "JEM", "Job control", "Job exposure matrix", "Key terms cardiovascular disease", "Psychological demand", "Psychosocial work environment", "Stress", "Work stress"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090178241", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"8862020900": {"Name": "Rugulies R.", "AuthorID": "8862020900", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Copenhagen"}, "57189055544": {"Name": "Framke E.", "AuthorID": "57189055544", "AffiliationID": "60012953", "AffiliationName": "National Research Centre for the Working Environment"}, "57211442854": {"Name": "S\u00f8rensen J.K.", "AuthorID": "57211442854", "AffiliationID": "60012953", "AffiliationName": "National Research Centre for the Working Environment"}, "57190818260": {"Name": "Svane-Petersen A.C.", "AuthorID": "57190818260", "AffiliationID": "60012953", "AffiliationName": "National Research Centre for the Working Environment"}, "36632817300": {"Name": "Madsen I.E.H.", "AuthorID": "36632817300", "AffiliationID": "60012953", "AffiliationName": "National Research Centre for the Working Environment"}, "57203615122": {"Name": "Alexanderson K.", "AuthorID": "57203615122", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Division of Insurance Medicine, Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet"}, "57189699491": {"Name": "Farrants K.", "AuthorID": "57189699491", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Division of Insurance Medicine, Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet"}, "7005973020": {"Name": "Bonde J.P.", "AuthorID": "7005973020", "AffiliationID": "60007006", "AffiliationName": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg Hospital"}, "24376370100": {"Name": "Flachs E.M.", "AuthorID": "24376370100", "AffiliationID": "60007006", "AffiliationName": "Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg Hospital"}, "57218718904": {"Name": "Hanson L.L.M.", "AuthorID": "57218718904", "AffiliationID": "60027398, 60028378", "AffiliationName": "Stress Research Institute, Stockholm University"}, "16835278700": {"Name": "Nyberg S.T.", "AuthorID": "16835278700", "AffiliationID": "60002952, 60029080", "AffiliationName": "Clinicum, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki"}, "57218590862": {"Name": "Fmedsci M.K.", "AuthorID": "57218590862", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
