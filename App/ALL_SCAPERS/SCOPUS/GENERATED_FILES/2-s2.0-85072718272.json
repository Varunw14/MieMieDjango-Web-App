In Caenorhabditis elegans, ascaroside pheromones can dictate local population density; high levels of pheromones inhibit the reproductive maturation of individuals. Little is known about how natural genetic diversity affects the pheromone responses of individuals from diverse habitats. Here, we show that a niche-associated variation in pheromone receptor genes contributes to natural differences in pheromone responses. We identified putative loss-of-function deletions that impair duplicated pheromone receptor genes (srg-36 and srg-37), which were previously shown to be lost in population-dense laboratory cultures. A common natural deletion in srg-37 arose recently from a single ancestral population that spread throughout the world; this deletion underlies reduced pheromone sensitivity across the global C. elegans population. We found that many local populations harbour individuals with a wild-type or a deletion allele of srg-37, suggesting that balancing selection has maintained the recent variation in this pheromone receptor gene. The two srg-37 genotypes are associated with niche diversity underlying boom-and-bust population dynamics. We hypothesize that human activities likely contributed to the gene flow and balancing selection of srg-37 variation through facilitating the migration of species and providing a favourable niche for the recently arisen srg-37 deletion.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Caenorhabditis elegans", "Gene Flow", "Pheromones"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072718272", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"]], "AuthorData": {"55939888000": {"Name": "Lee D.", "AuthorID": "55939888000", "AffiliationID": "60007363", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Biosciences, Northwestern University"}, "55938373000": {"Name": "Zdraljevic S.", "AuthorID": "55938373000", "AffiliationID": "60007363", "AffiliationName": "Interdisciplinary Biological Sciences Program, Northwestern University"}, "57191073588": {"Name": "Cook D.E.", "AuthorID": "57191073588", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "The Francis Crick Institute"}, "14057501600": {"Name": "Andersen E.C.", "AuthorID": "14057501600", "AffiliationID": "60007363", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Biosciences, Northwestern University"}, "23488638500": {"Name": "Fr\u00e9zal L.", "AuthorID": "23488638500", "AffiliationID": "60105781, 60000179, 60008134, 60000905, 60108665", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Biologie de l\u2019Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, CNRS, Inserm, \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, Paris Sciences et Lettres"}, "7006883338": {"Name": "F\u00e9lix M.A.", "AuthorID": "7006883338", "AffiliationID": "60105781, 60000179, 60008134, 60000905, 60108665", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Biologie de l\u2019Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, CNRS, Inserm, \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, Paris Sciences et Lettres"}, "57196017135": {"Name": "Hsu J.C.", "AuthorID": "57196017135", "AffiliationID": "60092854, 60016969", "AffiliationName": "Biodiversity Research Center, Academia Sinica"}, "24448904100": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "24448904100", "AffiliationID": "60092854, 60016969", "AffiliationName": "Biodiversity Research Center, Academia Sinica"}, "55513206500": {"Name": "Sterken M.G.", "AuthorID": "55513206500", "AffiliationID": "60004156", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Nematology, Wageningen University and Research"}, "6507433264": {"Name": "Riksen J.A.G.", "AuthorID": "6507433264", "AffiliationID": "60004156", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Nematology, Wageningen University and Research"}, "6602105133": {"Name": "Kammenga J.E.", "AuthorID": "6602105133", "AffiliationID": "60004156", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Nematology, Wageningen University and Research"}, "36943326300": {"Name": "Braendle C.", "AuthorID": "36943326300", "AffiliationID": "60110693, 60110756, 60008134, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, CNRS, Inserm, IBV"}, "8342418700": {"Name": "Schroeder F.C.", "AuthorID": "8342418700", "AffiliationID": "60015577, 60007776", "AffiliationName": "Boyce Thompson Institute and Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell University"}}}
