As an alternative, nanostructured, mechanical bactericidal surfaces may hold promise in killing bacteria without triggering antimicrobial resistance; however, accumulation of dead bacteria would greatly reduce their antimicrobial activity. In this study, for the first time we report a surprising discovery that the lotus leaf, well known for its superhydrophobicity, has demonstrated not only strong repelling effect against bacteria but also bactericidal activity via a cell-rupturing mechanism. Inspired by this unexpected finding, we subsequently designed and prepared a hierarchically structured surface, which was rendered superhydrophobic (water contact angle: 174\u00b0; roll-off angle: <1\u00b0) upon surface perfluorination. The hierarchically structured surface has displayed remarkable synergistic antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli: while the majority of the bacteria (>99%) were repelled from the surface (non-fouling), those tenacious bacteria that managed to be in touch of the surface were physically killed completely. Compared to a conventional superhydrophobic surface (non-fouling to some extent, but no bacteria-killing) or a mechanical bactericidal surface (bacteria-killing but not bacteria-repelling), our new structured surface has the great advantage in maintaining long-term effectiveness in antimicrobial activity based entirely on physical mechanism.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomimetic hierarchical structures", "Long-term antimicrobial", "Lotus leaf surface", "Mechanical bactericidal", "Synergistic antibacterial"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-microbial activity", "Antibiotic resistance", "Antimicrobial resistances", "Bacterial infections", "Bactericidal activity", "Bactericidal surface", "Drug-resistant bacteria", "Super-hydrophobic surfaces"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086107631", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"57194702150": {"Name": "Jiang R.", "AuthorID": "57194702150", "AffiliationID": "60007711, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Bionic Engineering, Ministry of Education, Jilin University"}, "57192644073": {"Name": "Hao L.", "AuthorID": "57192644073", "AffiliationID": "60007711", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry, Jilin University"}, "24921930700": {"Name": "Tian L.", "AuthorID": "24921930700", "AffiliationID": "60007711, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Bionic Engineering, Ministry of Education, Jilin University"}, "57189027463": {"Name": "Zhao J.", "AuthorID": "57189027463", "AffiliationID": "60007711, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Bionic Engineering, Ministry of Education, Jilin University"}, "57211320162": {"Name": "Ren L.", "AuthorID": "57211320162", "AffiliationID": "60007711, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Bionic Engineering, Ministry of Education, Jilin University"}, "35236898100": {"Name": "Fan Y.", "AuthorID": "35236898100", "AffiliationID": "60007711", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry, Jilin University"}, "36438907700": {"Name": "Song L.", "AuthorID": "36438907700", "AffiliationID": "60001255", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Polymer Physics and Chemistry, Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry"}, "57217083806": {"Name": "Liu C.", "AuthorID": "57217083806", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedic and Musculoskeletal Science Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, University College London"}, "35574340200": {"Name": "Ming W.", "AuthorID": "35574340200", "AffiliationID": "60020059", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Georgia Southern University"}}}
