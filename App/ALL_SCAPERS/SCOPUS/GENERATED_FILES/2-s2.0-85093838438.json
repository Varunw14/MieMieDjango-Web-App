Due to the chiral nature of the electroweak theory, explicit spin dependence in the shower algorithm is required. We thus use the spinor-helicity formalism to compute helicity-dependent branching kernels, taking special care to deal with the gauge relics that may appear in computation that involve longitudinal polarizations of the massive electroweak vector bosons. These kernels are used to construct a shower algorithm that includes all possible collinear final-state electroweak branchings, including those induced by the Yang\u2013Mills triple vector boson coupling and all Higgs couplings, as well as vector boson emissions from the initial state. We incorporate a treatment of features particular to the electroweak theory, such as the effects of bosonic interference and recoiler effects, as well as a preliminary description of the overlap between electroweak branchings and resonance decays. Some qualifying results on electroweak branching spectra at high energies, as well as effects on LHC physics are presented. Possible future improvements are discussed, including treatment of soft and spin effects, as well as issues unique to the electroweak sector.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85093838438", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (miscellaneous)", "ENGI", "2201"], ["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"7004653679": {"Name": "Kleiss R.", "AuthorID": "7004653679", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Radboud University Nijmegen"}, "55754789500": {"Name": "Verheyen R.", "AuthorID": "55754789500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
