In Golders Green, the Litvish community organises itself while competing within a diverse population. This reality brings exposure to and rationalisation of the employment market and consumer culture, with a weakening of religious reliance. Personal responsibility allows the Litvish man a degree of flexibility when combining religious studies and employment, and relative freedom in adapting the communal lifestyle to his abilities and professional preferences. In Gateshead, the community is organised in a \u201ctop-down\u201d manner and arranged around its bold institutions. Social norms and mechanisms of supervision create a high level of awareness of the leadership\u2019s values and expectations. In Gateshead\u2019s municipal politics, the awareness to the Litvish Haredi group increases, as they are highly aware of the demographic characteristic and the unique housing needs of this community. These preferences and tendencies find expression in the residential enclaves: the clustering within a community enclave, the extremism against other communities in Gateshead, and the high level of residential heterogeneity within other Jewish and non-Jewish communities in Golders Green, all award the delineated area its spatial boundaries.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cultural dominance", "Group behaviour", "Residential enclaves", "Residential relations", "Territoriality", "Voluntary ghetto"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073156649", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"55536712300": {"Name": "Flint Ashery S.", "AuthorID": "55536712300", "AffiliationID": "60002765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography and Environment, Bar Ilan University"}}}
