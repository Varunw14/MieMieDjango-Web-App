Pucino et al. report that lactate induces expression of its own transporter, SLC5A12, driving lactate uptake into CD4+ T cells and resulting in increased IL17 production via PKM2/STAT3 signaling and enhanced fatty acid synthesis. They provide evidence that targeting SLC5A12 may ameliorate chronic inflammatory disorders.\u00a9 2019 The AuthorsAccumulation of lactate in the tissue microenvironment is a feature of both inflammatory disease and cancer. Here, we assess the response of immune cells to lactate in the context of chronic inflammation. We report that lactate accumulation in the inflamed tissue contributes to the upregulation of the lactate transporter SLC5A12 by human CD4+ T cells. SLC5A12-mediated lactate uptake into CD4+ T cells induces a reshaping of their effector phenotype, resulting in increased IL17 production via nuclear PKM2/STAT3 and enhanced fatty acid synthesis. It also leads to CD4+ T cell retention in the inflamed tissue as a consequence of reduced glycolysis and enhanced fatty acid synthesis. Furthermore, antibody-mediated blockade of SLC5A12 ameliorates the disease severity in a murine model of arthritis. Finally, we propose that lactate/SLC5A12-induced metabolic reprogramming is a distinctive feature of lymphoid synovitis in rheumatoid arthritis patients and a potential therapeutic target in chronic inflammatory disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cytokines", "immunometabolism", "inflammation", "lactate", "lactate transporter", "metabolic crosstalk", "signaling", "T cell", "translational research"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cell Line", "Fatty Acids", "Female", "Glycolysis", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Interleukin-17", "Lactic Acid", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Monocarboxylic Acid Transporters", "Symporters"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075472397", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"55498021100": {"Name": "Pucino V.", "AuthorID": "55498021100", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57211943707": {"Name": "Certo M.", "AuthorID": "57211943707", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "56541110700": {"Name": "Mauro C.", "AuthorID": "56541110700", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "43860979800": {"Name": "Cucchi D.", "AuthorID": "43860979800", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57209571554": {"Name": "Goldmann K.", "AuthorID": "57209571554", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "36982200500": {"Name": "Pontarini E.", "AuthorID": "36982200500", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "56672409200": {"Name": "Haas R.", "AuthorID": "56672409200", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "56764752300": {"Name": "Smith J.", "AuthorID": "56764752300", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "55916340700": {"Name": "Headland S.E.", "AuthorID": "55916340700", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "37118552400": {"Name": "Blighe K.", "AuthorID": "37118552400", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "15922911200": {"Name": "Humby F.", "AuthorID": "15922911200", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7404188045": {"Name": "Lewis M.J.", "AuthorID": "7404188045", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "6505965080": {"Name": "Bombardieri M.", "AuthorID": "6505965080", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57203081188": {"Name": "Pitzalis C.", "AuthorID": "57203081188", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "25951237100": {"Name": "Bulusu V.", "AuthorID": "25951237100", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow"}, "23008898000": {"Name": "Kamphorst J.J.", "AuthorID": "23008898000", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow"}, "6506814092": {"Name": "Ruscica M.", "AuthorID": "6506814092", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacological and Biomolecular Sciences, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano"}}}
