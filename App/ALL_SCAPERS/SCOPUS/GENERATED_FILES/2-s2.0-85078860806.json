Both grape skin and seed extracts could become a valuable source of antioxidant compounds. Their valorisation towards that direction facilitates maintaining the environmental equilibrium. In the present study the method of producing an ethanolic extract of the red grape berries is presented and characteristics of it are shown.The method of the extraction process involved maceration followed by percolation; in the end of the process a strict protocol for quality control was applied. The extracts obtained via the specific extraction can be used either as individual medicinal for cures or in combination with other natural extracts to reestablish the healthy natural functions of the body. The current study, aims to production of pharmaceutical products such as capsules, tablets, drops, powder and elixirs from the red grape berries. The most important feature of this production is that all materials and products are non-toxic, natural and friendly to the environment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anthocyanins", "Extraction", "Flavonoids", "Red grape"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078860806", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"57211821538": {"Name": "Santzouk G.", "AuthorID": "57211821538", "AffiliationID": "123835690", "AffiliationName": "Santzouk Samir and Co.
