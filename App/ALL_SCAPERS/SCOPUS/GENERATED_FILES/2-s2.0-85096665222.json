The prospects are particularly poor for high-risk offenders with up to a third of those released in New Zealand returning to prison within 100 days. Aims/hypotheses: We developed the Parole Experiences Measure (PEM) to quantify the quality of men's life experiences during the first weeks of re-entry from prison. We aimed to answer the question, can the quality of life experiences differentiate men who survive in the community without reconviction from those who do not?. Methods: Using a longitudinal design, we examined whether PEM scores for 178 men with extensive histories of crime and violence predicted three recidivism indices (breach of parole, reconviction and reimprisonment) over a 12-month follow-up period. Results: We found that PEM scores predicted all three indices of recidivism. Of the two PEM subscales, external circumstances (finances, support, accommodation) were more predictive of recidivism than subjective wellbeing (mental and physical health). Conclusions/implications: The results suggest that meeting basic practical needs in the early months of parole may be more important to avoiding reconviction than attending only to mental and physical health.", "AuthorKeywords": ["accommodation", "high-risk prisoner", "parole", "parole survival", "re-entry", "recidivism prediction", "reintegration", "resettlement", "wellbeing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Crime", "Criminals", "Employment", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "New Zealand", "Prisoners", "Prisons", "Quality of Life", "Recidivism", "Social Support", "Violence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096665222", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Psychology (miscellaneous)", "PSYC", "3201"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57209368913": {"Name": "Gwynne J.L.", "AuthorID": "57209368913", "AffiliationID": "60002316", "AffiliationName": "Victoria University of Wellington"}, "54893765200": {"Name": "Yesberg J.A.", "AuthorID": "54893765200", "AffiliationID": "60002316", "AffiliationName": "Victoria University of Wellington"}, "6603529993": {"Name": "Polaschek D.L.L.", "AuthorID": "6603529993", "AffiliationID": "60002316", "AffiliationName": "Victoria University of Wellington"}}}
