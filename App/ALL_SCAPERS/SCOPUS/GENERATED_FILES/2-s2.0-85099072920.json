All rights reserved.Context: Periodontitis confers an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and, in patients with obesity, it might interfere with the incretin axis. The effect of periodontal treatment on glucoregulatory hormones remains unknown. Objective: To evaluate the effect of periodontal treatment on incretin axis in obese and lean nondiabetic individuals. Setting: King's College Dental Hospital and Institute, London, UK. Participants and Methods: The metabolic profile of obese and normal-body-mass-index individuals affected by periodontitis was studied at baseline, 2, and 6 months after intensive periodontal treatment, by measuring plasma insulin, glucagon, glucagon-like peptide-1(GLP-1), and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and markers of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. Main Outcome Measure(s): Circulating levels of incretins and inflammatory markers. Results: At baseline, periodontal parameters were worse for obese than nonobese; this was accompanied by higher levels of circulating high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), insulin, and GLP-1. The response to periodontal treatment was less favorable in the obese group, without significant variations of hs-CRP or malondialdehyde. Glucoregulatory hormones changed differently after treatment: while insulin and glucagon did not vary at 2 and 6 months, GLP-1 and GIP significantly increased at 6 months in both groups. In particular, GLP-1 increased more rapidly in obese participants, while the increase of GIP followed similar trends across visits in both groups. Conclusions: Nonsurgical treatment of periodontitis is associated with increased GLP-1 and GIP levels in nonobese and obese patients; changes in GLP-1 were more rapid in obese participants. This might have positive implications for the metabolic risk of these individuals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Incretin axis", "Obesity", "Periodontitis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85099072920", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Biochemistry (medical)", "MEDI", "2704"]], "AuthorData": {"57221405826": {"Name": "Suvan J.", "AuthorID": "57221405826", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013985", "AffiliationName": "Periodontology Unit, University College London Eastman Dental Institute"}, "6507835161": {"Name": "Harrington Z.", "AuthorID": "6507835161", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013985", "AffiliationName": "Periodontology Unit, University College London Eastman Dental Institute"}, "6507515725": {"Name": "D'Aiuto F.", "AuthorID": "6507515725", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013985", "AffiliationName": "Periodontology Unit, University College London Eastman Dental Institute"}, "57210724180": {"Name": "Masi S.", "AuthorID": "57210724180", "AffiliationID": "60028868", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa"}, "8576854900": {"Name": "Santini E.", "AuthorID": "8576854900", "AffiliationID": "60082061", "AffiliationName": "Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Pisana"}, "6603910070": {"Name": "Raggi F.", "AuthorID": "6603910070", "AffiliationID": "60028868", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgical, Medical, Molecular and Critical Area Pathology, University of Pisa"}, "7006193279": {"Name": "Solini A.", "AuthorID": "7006193279", "AffiliationID": "60028868", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgical, Medical, Molecular and Critical Area Pathology, University of Pisa"}}}
