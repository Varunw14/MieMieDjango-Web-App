With recent advances in computer modeling, simulation tools, and analysis techniques, topics such as human-building interactions and occupant behavior have gained significant interest in the literature given their premise of improving building design processes and operating strategies. In practice, the focus of occupant-centric literature has been mostly geared towards the latter (i.e., operation), leaving the implications on building design practices underexplored. This paper fills the gap by providing a critical review of existing studies applying computer-based modeling and simulation to guide occupant-centric building design. The reviewed papers are organized along four main themes, namely occupant-centric: (i) metrics of building performance, (ii) modeling and simulation approaches, (iii) design methods and applications, and (iv) supporting practices and mechanisms. Important barriers are identified for a more effective application of occupant-centric building design practices, including the limited consideration of metrics beyond energy efficiency (e.g., occupant well-being and space planning), the limited implementation and validation of the proposed methods, and the lack of integration of occupant behavior modeling in existing building performance simulation tools. Future research directions are discussed, covering large-scale international data collection efforts to move from generic assumptions about occupant behavior to specific/localized knowledge, improved metrics of measuring building performance, and improved industry practices, such as building codes, to promote an occupant-in-the-loop approach to the building design process.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Building design", "Building performance simulation", "Human-building interaction", "Occupant behavior", "Occupant-centric", "Performance metrics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Analysis techniques", "Building design process", "Building performance", "Building performance simulations", "Computer-based modeling", "Environmental conditions", "Future research directions", "Model and simulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088125228", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"36975172200": {"Name": "Azar E.", "AuthorID": "36975172200", "AffiliationID": "60104134", "AffiliationName": "Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Khalifa University of Science and Technology"}, "57212926253": {"Name": "O'Brien W.", "AuthorID": "57212926253", "AffiliationID": "60017592", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Carleton University"}, "57210799451": {"Name": "Abuimara T.", "AuthorID": "57210799451", "AffiliationID": "60017592", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Carleton University"}, "55331189400": {"Name": "Carlucci S.", "AuthorID": "55331189400", "AffiliationID": "60013141", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Norwegian University of Science and Technology"}, "7202830430": {"Name": "Hong T.", "AuthorID": "7202830430", "AffiliationID": "60007174", "AffiliationName": "Building Technology and Urban Systems Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"}, "57194113958": {"Name": "Sonta A.", "AuthorID": "57194113958", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Urban Informatics Lab, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Stanford University"}, "54968992700": {"Name": "Jain R.K.", "AuthorID": "54968992700", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Urban Informatics Lab, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Stanford University"}, "57135548100": {"Name": "Kim J.", "AuthorID": "57135548100", "AffiliationID": "60014171", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Waterloo"}, "56315594400": {"Name": "Andargie M.S.", "AuthorID": "56315594400", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Mineral Engineering, University of Toronto"}, "34868168700": {"Name": "El Asmar M.", "AuthorID": "34868168700", "AffiliationID": "60003892", "AffiliationName": "School of Sustainable Engineering and the Built Environment, Arizona State University"}, "56422210800": {"Name": "Ouf M.M.", "AuthorID": "56422210800", "AffiliationID": "60033154", "AffiliationName": "Department of Building, Civil, and Environmental Engineering, Concordia University"}, "56367480500": {"Name": "Tahmasebi F.", "AuthorID": "56367480500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering, University College London"}, "38362544900": {"Name": "Zhou J.", "AuthorID": "38362544900", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Engineering, Monash University"}}}
