Methods: Cross-sectional analyses of Helsinki Businessmen Study (HBS, mean age 87 years) participants who came to clinic visit in 2017/2018. Nutritional status, physical performance and fasting blood samples were measured. Food and dietary intakes were retrieved from 3-day food diaries. Body composition was measured and appendicular lean mass (ALM) per m2 was dichotomized as ALM/m2 < 7 kg/m2 and \u2265 7 kg/m2. Differences between lower and higher ALM were analyzed using t test or Mann\u2013Whitney U test. Analysis of covariance was used to investigate independent associations with ALM/m2. Results: Random sample of 130 participants took part in the medical examinations, 126 returned food diaries, and 102 underwent DXA-scan. ALM/m2 was associated with total protein (p = 0.033), animal protein (p = 0.043) and meat protein (p = 0.033) intakes. Protein distribution between daily meals differed at lunch; those with higher ALM/m2 ate more protein (p =.047) at lunch. Consumption of fruits, vegetables (p = 0.022) and meat (p = 0.006) was associated with ALM/m2. Conclusion: Protein intake, source and distribution as well fruit and vegetable intakes were associated with higher ALM in oldest-old men.
