Complemented by system-tailored geometrical constellation shaping and nonlinearity compensation, it enabled a record capacity transmission of 74.38 Tb/s over 6,300 km of G.654 single-mode fibre. The hybrid scheme, combining backward Raman pre-amplification with EDFA, significantly improves the average effective noise figure across the entire bandwidth, allowing the use of span lengths of 70 km. The system-tailored GS-64QAM constellation was optimised to both linear link impairments and transceiver nonlinearities, improving the gap to the AWGN channel capacity relative to square 64QAM from 0.6 bit/symbol to 0.35 bit/symbol. We experimentally evaluated the system performance using the bit-wise achievable information rate (AIR) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the end of transmission, as well as post SD-FEC BER.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Broadband C+L band transoceanic transmission", "Erbium-doped fibre amplifier", "geometric constellation shaping", "nonlinear compensation", "Raman amplification"], "IndexKeywords": ["Achievable information rate", "C+l bands", "Capacity transmission", "Constellation shaping", "Non-linear compensations", "Non-linearity compensation", "Optical amplifications", "Raman amplification"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078697218", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"36703872700": {"Name": "Ionescu M.", "AuthorID": "36703872700", "AffiliationID": "60021378", "AffiliationName": "Nokia Bell Labs, Paris-Saclay"}, "57207909444": {"Name": "Edwards A.", "AuthorID": "57207909444", "AffiliationID": "106743566", "AffiliationName": "Xtera, Bates House"}, "6602304906": {"Name": "Pelouch W.", "AuthorID": "6602304906", "AffiliationID": "106743566", "AffiliationName": "Xtera, Bates House"}, "57214747345": {"Name": "Barnes S.", "AuthorID": "57214747345", "AffiliationID": "106743566", "AffiliationName": "Xtera, Bates House"}, "7005053644": {"Name": "Bayvel P.", "AuthorID": "7005053644", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University College London"}, "57110068500": {"Name": "Lavery D.", "AuthorID": "57110068500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University College London"}, "57110425500": {"Name": "Sillekens E.", "AuthorID": "57110425500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University College London"}, "57192990604": {"Name": "Semrau D.", "AuthorID": "57192990604", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University College London"}, "36192836100": {"Name": "Galdino L.", "AuthorID": "36192836100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University College London"}, "7003479201": {"Name": "Killey R.I.", "AuthorID": "7003479201", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University College London"}}}
