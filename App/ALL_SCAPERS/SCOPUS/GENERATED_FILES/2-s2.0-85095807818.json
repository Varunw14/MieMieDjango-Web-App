We present a model that illustrates the differences between the intended experience and the actual experience of people. The model is demonstrated through the analysis of one interactive installation at the Science Museum (London) and the various parameters are mapped and visualized. We suggest that the participants of interactive installations engage differently than originally intended by the designer, which can be defined here as \"deviation\". There are several levels of deviation, and the proposed model will illustrate the critical interaction stages and visualize the deviations. This model offers new tools for designers and curators alike.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deviated behaviors", "Engagement", "Intended experience", "Interactive installations"], "IndexKeywords": ["Interactive installations", "Science museum"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095807818", "SubjectAreas": [["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"57219872437": {"Name": "Wei D.", "AuthorID": "57219872437", "AffiliationID": "60085003, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Architecture, University College London"}, "12807514300": {"Name": "Schieck A.F.G.", "AuthorID": "12807514300", "AffiliationID": "60085003, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Architecture, University College London"}, "55921115600": {"Name": "Marquardt N.", "AuthorID": "55921115600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Ucl Interaction Centre, University College London"}}}
