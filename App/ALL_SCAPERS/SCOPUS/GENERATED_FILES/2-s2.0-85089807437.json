These approaches will be accelerated through the development of novel strategies that target multiple pharmacologically active sites using a combination of different biologics, or mixtures of biologics and small molecule therapeutics. However, for this potential to be realised, advancements in co-formulation strategies for biologic therapeutics must be established. This review describes the current and emerging developments within this field and highlights the challenges and potential solutions, that will pave-the-way towards their clinical translation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biologics", "Co-formulation", "Combination therapy", "Nucleic acid", "Protein", "Synergistic benefit", "Vaccine"], "IndexKeywords": ["Active site", "Clinical translation", "Novel strategies", "Small molecules"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089807437", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"37088034500": {"Name": "Chauhan V.M.", "AuthorID": "37088034500", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Materials & Healthcare Technologies Group, School of Pharmacy, University of Nottingham"}, "57201074760": {"Name": "Aylott J.W.", "AuthorID": "57201074760", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Materials & Healthcare Technologies Group, School of Pharmacy, University of Nottingham"}, "57218620432": {"Name": "Zhang H.", "AuthorID": "57218620432", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Future Targeted Healthcare Manufacturing Hub, Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "6701589883": {"Name": "Dalby P.A.", "AuthorID": "6701589883", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Future Targeted Healthcare Manufacturing Hub, Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
