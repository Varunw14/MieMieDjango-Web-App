Factors affecting the MS gas traces were identified during the duration of the fed-batch cultures. Correlation between viable cell concentration (VCC) and oxygen concentration of the inlet gas into the bioreactor (O2-in) resulted in R2 \u2248 0.9; O2-in could be used as a proxy for VCC. Oxygen mass transfer (kLa) was also quantified throughout the culture period with antifoam addition at different time points which is shown to lower the kLa. Real-time specific oxygen consumption rate (qO2) of 2\u201320 pmol/cell/day throughout the bioreactor runs were within the range of values reported in literature for mammalian cell cultures. We also report, to our knowledge, the first instance of a distinct correlation between respiration quotient (RQ) and the metabolic state of the cell culture with regard to lactate production phase (average RQ > 1) and consumption phase (average RQ < 1).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bioprocessing", "Mass spectrometry", "On-line monitoring", "Process analytics", "Process control"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bioprocessing", "Fed-batch cultures", "Mammalian cell culture", "Online monitoring", "Oxygen concentrations", "Oxygen consumption rate", "Oxygen mass transfer", "Process analytics", "Animals", "Batch Cell Culture Techniques", "Bioreactors", "CHO Cells", "Cricetulus", "Mammals", "Mass Spectrometry", "Oxygen Consumption"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074825181", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"]], "AuthorData": {"57198900471": {"Name": "Goh H.Y.", "AuthorID": "57198900471", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57211677955": {"Name": "Sulu M.", "AuthorID": "57211677955", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57211689206": {"Name": "Alosert H.", "AuthorID": "57211689206", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57192812745": {"Name": "Lewis G.L.", "AuthorID": "57192812745", "AffiliationID": "60032927", "AffiliationName": "Thermo Fisher Scientific"}, "57220646800": {"Name": "Josland G.D.", "AuthorID": "57220646800", "AffiliationID": "60032927", "AffiliationName": "Thermo Fisher Scientific"}, "6701745024": {"Name": "Merriman D.E.", "AuthorID": "6701745024", "AffiliationID": "60032927", "AffiliationName": "Thermo Fisher Scientific"}}}
