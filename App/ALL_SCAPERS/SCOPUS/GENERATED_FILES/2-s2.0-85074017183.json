Classical DCs have been divided into two subsets, cDC1 and cDC2, based on phenotypic markers and their distinct abilities to prime CD8 and CD4 T cells. While the transcriptional regulation of the cDC1 subset has been well characterized, cDC2 development and function remain poorly understood. By combining transcriptional and chromatin analyses with genetic reporter expression, we identified two principal cDC2 lineages defined by distinct developmental pathways and transcriptional regulators, including T-bet and ROR\u03b3t, two key transcription factors known to define innate and adaptive lymphocyte subsets. These novel cDC2 lineages were characterized by distinct metabolic and functional programs. Extending our findings to humans revealed conserved DC heterogeneity and the presence of the newly defined cDC2 subsets in human cancer.\u00a9 2019 The AuthorsSingle-cell analyses of dendritic cells reveals new subsets with distinct pro- and anti-inflammatory potential.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ATAC-sequencing", "dendritic cells", "myeloid cells", "single-cell RNA-sequencing", "T-bet", "transcriptional regulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptive Immunity", "Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Lineage", "Chromatin", "Dendritic Cells", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Genetic Heterogeneity", "Humans", "Immunity, Innate", "Lymphocyte Subsets", "Mice", "Neoplasms", "T-Lymphocytes", "Transcription, Genetic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074017183", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"55786615800": {"Name": "Brown C.C.", "AuthorID": "55786615800", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Infection, Inflammation and Rheumatology Section, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57220336100": {"Name": "Deep D.", "AuthorID": "57220336100", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Immunology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"}, "49861781200": {"Name": "Mendoza A.", "AuthorID": "49861781200", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Immunology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"}, "57202646006": {"Name": "Fromme R.", "AuthorID": "57202646006", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Immunology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"}, "6602959362": {"Name": "Ariyan C.", "AuthorID": "6602959362", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Ludwig Center at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"}, "7005761205": {"Name": "Rudensky A.Y.", "AuthorID": "7005761205", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Ludwig Center at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"}, "36548191400": {"Name": "Gudjonson H.", "AuthorID": "36548191400", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Infection, Inflammation and Rheumatology Section, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "19639285500": {"Name": "Pritykin Y.", "AuthorID": "19639285500", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Computational and Systems Biology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"}, "56471919100": {"Name": "Lavall\u00e9e V.P.", "AuthorID": "56471919100", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Computational and Systems Biology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"}, "26648876800": {"Name": "Mazutis L.", "AuthorID": "26648876800", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Computational and Systems Biology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"}, "7101903349": {"Name": "Leslie C.", "AuthorID": "7101903349", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Computational and Systems Biology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"}, "7801385757": {"Name": "Pe'er D.", "AuthorID": "7801385757", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Computational and Systems Biology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"}}}
