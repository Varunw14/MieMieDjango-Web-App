The association of alcohol dependence with insomnia is likely to be bidirectional in nature. Alcohol use is common among older people in many societies and the prevalence of insomnia tends to increase with age, therefore this group warrants particular consideration. We explored the cross sectional and long term (30 years) associations between alcohol drinking (volume and hazardous drinking) and sleep duration and insomnia in a general population study of older adults (6,117 male and female civil servants followed for 30 years). For men, drinking more than 21 units (approximately 168 grams) of alcohol per week, compared with not drinking, was associated with waking several times a night (odds ratio 1.30, confidence intervals 1.02\u20131.66). Men who maintained a heavy volume of drinking over the three decades of observation, or who had an unstable consumption pattern, tended to have worse sleep profiles in terms of waking tired and waking several times. Sustained male hazardous drinking (as measured by the AUDIT-C scale) was also associated with worse sleep profiles. Findings for women were not so clear. In this population based setting, drinking high volumes of alcohol may contribute to the prevalence of sleep problems in older age, particularly for men. People in this age group should be discouraged from using alcohol as a sleep aid.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alcohol Abstinence", "Alcohol Drinking", "Alcoholism", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Government Employees", "Humans", "London", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prevalence", "Self Medication", "Sex Factors", "Sleep Wake Disorders"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082379976", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"20133865900": {"Name": "Britton A.", "AuthorID": "20133865900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "55208167800": {"Name": "Fat L.N.", "AuthorID": "55208167800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "23670784300": {"Name": "Neligan A.", "AuthorID": "23670784300", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}}}
