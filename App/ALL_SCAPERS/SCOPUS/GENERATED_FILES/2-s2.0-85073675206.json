The polyglutamine tract is preceded by a 17-residue sequence that is intrinsically disordered. This region is subject to phosphorylation, acetylation and other post-translational modifications in vivo, which modulate its secondary structure, aggregation and, subcellular localization. We used Molecular Dynamics simulations with a novel Hamiltonian-replica-exchange-based enhanced sampling method, SWISH, and an optimal combination of water and protein force fields to study the effects of phosphorylation and acetylation as well as cross-talk between these modifications on the huntingtin N-terminus. The simulations, validated by circular dichroism, were used to formulate a mechanism by which the modifications influence helical conformations. Our findings have implications for understanding the structural basis underlying the effect of PTMs in the aggregation and cellular properties of huntingtin.", "AuthorKeywords": ["enhanced sampling", "Huntington's disease", "misfolding disease", "molecular dynamics", "peptide folding", "phosphorylation", "post-translational modifications"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073675206", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)", "BIOC", "1301"]], "AuthorData": {"57198424636": {"Name": "Yalinca H.", "AuthorID": "57198424636", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56404692400": {"Name": "Oleinikovas V.", "AuthorID": "56404692400", "AffiliationID": "60068605", "AffiliationName": "Vladimiras Oleinikovas, UCB Pharma"}, "6603509498": {"Name": "Gervasio F.", "AuthorID": "6603509498", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "57211377243": {"Name": "Gehin C.", "AuthorID": "57211377243", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Molecular and Chemical Biology of Neurodegeneration, Faculty of Life Sciences, Brain Mind Institute, EPFL"}, "6701639894": {"Name": "Lashuel H.", "AuthorID": "6701639894", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Molecular and Chemical Biology of Neurodegeneration, Faculty of Life Sciences, Brain Mind Institute, EPFL"}, "7101941822": {"Name": "Pastore A.", "AuthorID": "7101941822", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London"}}}
