It has proven difficult to establish a reliable diagnostic cut-off, possibly in part due to heterogenicity of case\u2013control groups. Our purpose was to investigate CSF CXCL13 concentrations in patients with similar clinical presentations, facial palsy. We retrospectively included patients with facial palsy associated with LNB (n = 21), or varicella zoster virus (VZV) (n = 26). Median CXCL13 concentrations were significantly higher in patients with LNB facial palsy compared to VZV facial palsy. Receiver-operating characteristic analyses yielded an optimal cut-off concentration at 34.5 pg/mL (sensitivity 85.7%, specificity of 84.6%), lower than that in previous studies. Although the analysis has potential, it is still not adequately established that CXCL13 provides additional, clinically useful, diagnostic information over current recommendations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cerebrospinal fluid", "CXCL13", "Facial paralysis", "Lyme neuroborreliosis", "Varicella zoster virus"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086920749", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57191909362": {"Name": "Lindstr\u00f6m J.", "AuthorID": "57191909362", "AffiliationID": "60079626, 60016437, 60027675", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "8560440400": {"Name": "Bremell D.", "AuthorID": "8560440400", "AffiliationID": "60079626, 60016437, 60027675", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "42961502100": {"Name": "Grahn A.", "AuthorID": "42961502100", "AffiliationID": "60079626, 60016437, 60027675", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "6602140935": {"Name": "Studahl M.", "AuthorID": "6602140935", "AffiliationID": "60079626, 60016437, 60027675", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "7101909602": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "7101909602", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "57208899083": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "57208899083", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL"}}}
