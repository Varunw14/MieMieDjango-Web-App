Scott 2013.This chapter demonstrates how exhibitions can provide a meeting place between collections, the institution, its audiences and unresolved public issues. The public value that museums create as forums for civic engagement is the subject of this chapter, illustrated through a case study exploring the engagement of Londoners with African Caribbean heritage in the development of a permanent gallery, London, Sugar and Slavery, which explores the history of London\u2019s involvement in the transatlantic slave trade and its legacies. The introduction is by David Spence, Director of Programmes at the Museum of London and Managing Director of Museum of London Docklands when London, Sugar and Slavery was created. There are further contributions from Dr Tom Wareham and Dr Caroline Bressey, both curators who worked with the Consultative Group on the gallery and Dr June Bam-Hutchison, who was the Museum\u2019s Diversity Manager and a key facilitator between the museum, the Consultative Group and local London communities. Annette Day, the museum\u2019s Head of Programmes, concludes by describing how the work continues today.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087263545", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"57214043881": {"Name": "Spence D.", "AuthorID": "57214043881", "AffiliationID": "60111702", "AffiliationName": "Museum of London"}, "55575614700": {"Name": "Wareham T.", "AuthorID": "55575614700", "AffiliationID": "60111702", "AffiliationName": "Curator of Community and Maritime History, Museum of London Docklands"}, "8574388200": {"Name": "Bressey C.", "AuthorID": "8574388200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56743361500": {"Name": "Bam-Hutchison J.", "AuthorID": "56743361500", "AffiliationID": "60171706", "AffiliationName": "Institute for the Public Understanding of the Past, York University and with Kingston University\u2019s Faculty of Business and Law"}}}
