Focal therapy relies on an accurate estimate of tumour volume for patient selection and treatment planning so that the optimal energy dose can be delivered to the target area(s) of the prostate while minimising toxicity to surrounding structures. This review provides an overview of different imaging modalities which may be used to optimise tumour volume assessment and critically evaluates the published evidence for each modality. Recent Findings: Multi-parametric MRI (mp-MRI) has become the standard tool for patient selection and guiding focal therapy treatment. The current evidence suggests that mp-MRI may underestimate tumour volume, although there is a large variability in results. There remain significant methodological challenges associated with pathological processing and accurate co-registration of histopathological data with mp-MRI. Advances in different ultrasound modalities are showing promise but there has been limited research into tumour volume estimation. The role of PSMA PET/CT is still evolving and further investigation is needed to establish if this is a viable technique for prostate tumour volumetric assessment. Summary: mp-MRI provides the necessary tumour volume information required for selecting patients and guiding focal therapy treatment. The potential for underestimation of tumour volume should be taken into account and an additional margin applied to ensure adequate treatment coverage. At present, there are no other viable image-based alternatives although advances in new technologies may refine volume estimations in the future.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Focal therapy", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Multi-parametric MRI", "Prostate cancer"], "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Male", "Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Neoplasm Staging", "Patient Care Planning", "Patient Selection", "Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "Tumor Burden"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089495076", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"55752715900": {"Name": "Eldred-Evans D.", "AuthorID": "55752715900", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "7201542866": {"Name": "Winkler M.", "AuthorID": "7201542866", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "8147855500": {"Name": "Ahmed H.U.", "AuthorID": "8147855500", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "35273779600": {"Name": "Tam H.", "AuthorID": "35273779600", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Charing Cross, Imperial Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "57218549538": {"Name": "Smith A.P.T.", "AuthorID": "57218549538", "AffiliationID": "60012558, 60020416, 60111785", "AffiliationName": "North West London Pathology, Charing Cross Hospital/Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}}}
