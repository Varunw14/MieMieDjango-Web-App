All rights reserved.The main objectives were to analyse the validity and accuracy of Body Mass Index (BMI) and Waist Circumference (WC) to evaluate obesity by excess of body fat in older adults and to identify more adequate cut-off points for this age group. The recommended cut-off points for BMI (25, 27 or 30 kg/m2) and WC (\u2265 102 cm for men and \u2265 88 cm for women or \u2265 90cm for men and \u2265 80 cm for women) were compared to the total body densitometry. BF was defined by a value higher than the 90th percentile. Out of the 132 participants, 61% were women and aged between 60 and 91 years. The recommended cut-off points of BMI \u2265 25kg/m2 and BMI \u2265 27 kg/m2 showed similar performances. BMI \u2265 30 kg/m2 showed high specificity but low sensitivity to identify BF in men and better performance in women. Con-ventional WC cut-off points showed low sensitivity and specificity. Based on our analyses, new cut-off points for BMI (25 kg/m2 for men and 26.6 kg/m2 for women) and WC (98.8 cm for men and 77.8cm for women) were proposed. The new cut-off points showed sensitivity and specificity values > 74% and accuracy > 76%. The areas under the curve (ROC) were > 0.86. The new BMI and WC cut-off points proposed in the present study for the diagnosis of obesity in older adults showed the best lev-els of sensitivity and specificity for this age group.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ageing", "Body composition", "Obesity", "Sensitivity and Specificity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Body Mass Index", "Dimensional Measurement Accuracy", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Obesity", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Waist Circumference"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081903156", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"47860980900": {"Name": "Silveira E.A.", "AuthorID": "47860980900", "AffiliationID": "60027136", "AffiliationName": "Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Goi\u00e1s"}, "7102235195": {"Name": "Barbosa L.S.", "AuthorID": "7102235195", "AffiliationID": "60027136", "AffiliationName": "Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Goi\u00e1s"}, "49362286500": {"Name": "Pagotto V.", "AuthorID": "49362286500", "AffiliationID": "112801527", "AffiliationName": "Faculdade de Enfermagem, Universidade Federal de Goi\u00e2nia"}, "7102223177": {"Name": "de Oliveira C.", "AuthorID": "7102223177", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College"}, "57215874334": {"Name": "Das Gra\u00e7as Pena G.", "AuthorID": "57215874334", "AffiliationID": "60015104", "AffiliationName": "Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Uberl\u00e2ndia"}, "6701742027": {"Name": "Velasquez-Melendez G.", "AuthorID": "6701742027", "AffiliationID": "60030074", "AffiliationName": "Escola de Enfermagem, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"}}}
