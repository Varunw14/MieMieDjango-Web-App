Fibrosis develops when extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling becomes excessive or uncontrolled and is associated with nearly all forms of heart disease. Cardiac fibroblasts and myofibroblasts are the main effectors of ECM deposition and scar formation. The heart is a complex multicellular organ, where the various resident cell types communicate between themselves and with cells of the blood and immune systems. Exosomes, which are small extracellular vesicles, (EVs), contribute to cell-to-cell communication and their pathophysiological relevance and therapeutic potential is emerging. Here, we will critically review the role of endogenous exosomes as possible fibrosis mediators and discuss the possibility of using stem cell-derived and/or engineered exosomes as anti-fibrotic agents.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cardiac fibrosis", "EVs engineering", "exosomes", "extracellular vesicle (EVs)", "heart failure", "microRNAs", "noncoding RNAs", "stem cells"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086001521", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57217080323": {"Name": "Tikhomirov R.", "AuthorID": "57217080323", "AffiliationID": "60070490", "AffiliationName": null}, "57218696195": {"Name": "Donnell B.R.O.", "AuthorID": "57218696195", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "57189309889": {"Name": "Catapano F.", "AuthorID": "57189309889", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "6701666274": {"Name": "Gorelik J.", "AuthorID": "6701666274", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "7006038261": {"Name": "Emanueli C.", "AuthorID": "7006038261", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "7004905834": {"Name": "Faggian G.", "AuthorID": "7004905834", "AffiliationID": "60032256", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Dentistry, Pediatrics and Gynecology, Cardiovascular Science, University of Verona, Policlinico G.B.
