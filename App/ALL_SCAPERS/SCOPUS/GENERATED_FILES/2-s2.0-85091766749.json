The rapid digital turn in historical research has prompted scholars to argue for conversations in which to consider the implications of digital technologies in historical research practices. Yet in historical geography, though scholars work with and make digital data in a multitude of ways, there has been little formal reflection on the concerns, challenges or methodological opportunities presented by the formation of digital archives. To do so this paper takes as its focus \u2018coloured\u2019 workers employed in forms of domestic service at the end of the nineteenth century in Australia. Firstly, by resurfacing \u2018coloured\u2019 workers through their presence in newspaper advertisements the paper illustrates that digital methodologies enable the identification of individuals missed through previous forms of data analysis. Secondly, the paper seeks to illustrate how their reappearance can frame a rethinking of domestic labour and colonial identities, gender roles and the ethnic complexities of \u2018coloured\u2019 labour in the British Empire. The paper argues that though newspaper advertisements for employment are brief and impersonal, and their meanings, as mediated through form and time, are at times hard to decipher, gathering them together into a new archive supports a more complex reading of diversity across national, regional, local and imperial geographies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Australia", "Black history", "British empire", "Digital archives", "Domestic service", "Newspapers"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091766749", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"8574388200": {"Name": "Bressey C.", "AuthorID": "8574388200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}}}
