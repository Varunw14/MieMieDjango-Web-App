Materials and methods: Retrospective review of patients diagnosed with ACT of the appendicular skeleton based on IGCNB who subsequently underwent surgical curettage or resection. Data collected included age, sex, skeletal location and surgical histology classified as ACT, high-grade chondrosarcoma (HG-CS) and dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma (DD-CS). Pre-biopsy MRI studies were reviewed independently by 2 radiologists blinded to surgical histology results and graded as ACT, HG-CS and DD-CS based on MRI features. Results: The study included 24 males and 28 females (mean age 42.1 years; range 9\u201376 years). One patient had 2 lesions treated, making a total of 53 lesions. Tumours were located in the femur in 21 cases, humerus in 17, tibia in 9, radius in 4 and ulna and fibula in 1 each. Surgical histology was ACT in 41 cases, HG-CS in 10 and DD-CS in 2, indicating mismatch between IGCNB and surgical histology in 12/53 cases (22.6%). Predicted MRI grade for the 2 readers was ACT in 39 cases each, HG-CS in 13 and 14 cases and DD-CS in 1 and 0 cases. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of MRI for predicting HG-CS/DD-CS were 91%, 93% and 92%, respectively. Inter-observer correlation was very good (kappa = 0.94). Discussion: Review of MRI findings in patients with ACT diagnosed on IGCNB is vital for identifying patients with a HG-CS/DD-CS and is recommended when planning surgical management or considering repeat IGCNB.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biopsy", "Bone neoplasms", "Chondrosarcoma", "MRI"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089391765", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"7006029340": {"Name": "Saifuddin A.", "AuthorID": "7006029340", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "36945698000": {"Name": "Khoo M.", "AuthorID": "36945698000", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "56932134800": {"Name": "O\u2019Donnell P.", "AuthorID": "56932134800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London"}, "57212055548": {"Name": "Oliveira I.", "AuthorID": "57212055548", "AffiliationID": "60105470", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, London North West Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "57217988711": {"Name": "Singla N.", "AuthorID": "57217988711", "AffiliationID": "60009217, 60024244", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Maulana Azad Medical College and Lok Nayak Hospital"}, "57217937414": {"Name": "Chavda A.", "AuthorID": "57217937414", "AffiliationID": "60025980, 60002484", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, West Middlesex University Hospital and Chelsea and Westminster Hospital"}}}
