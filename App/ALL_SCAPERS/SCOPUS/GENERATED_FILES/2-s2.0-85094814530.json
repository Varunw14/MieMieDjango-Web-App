Our emphasis is on the question to what extent local operators can be represented as random matrices and, in particular, to what extent matrix elements can be considered as uncorrelated. As a main result, we show that the eigenvalue distribution of band submatrices at a fixed energy density is a sensitive probe of the correlations between matrix elements. We find that, on the scales where the matrix elements are in a good agreement with all standard indicators of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, the eigenvalue distribution still exhibits clear signatures of the original operator, implying correlations between matrix elements. Moreover, we demonstrate that at much smaller energy scales, the eigenvalue distribution approximately assumes the universal semicircle shape, indicating transition to the random-matrix behavior, and in particular that matrix elements become uncorrelated.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Eigenvalue distributions", "Exact diagonalization", "Local operators", "Matrix elements", "Quantum spin chains", "Random matrices", "Sensitive probe", "Thermalization"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094814530", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57202418311": {"Name": "Richter J.", "AuthorID": "57202418311", "AffiliationID": "60009731", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Osnabr\u00fcck"}, "22636326900": {"Name": "Steinigeweg R.", "AuthorID": "22636326900", "AffiliationID": "60009731", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Osnabr\u00fcck"}, "6602279445": {"Name": "Gemmer J.", "AuthorID": "6602279445", "AffiliationID": "60009731", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Osnabr\u00fcck"}, "8839143400": {"Name": "Dymarsky A.", "AuthorID": "8839143400", "AffiliationID": "60015941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Kentucky"}}}
