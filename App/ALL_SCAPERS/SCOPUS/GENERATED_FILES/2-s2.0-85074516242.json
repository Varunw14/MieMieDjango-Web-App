Here, we examined such atypicalities in human biological motion. We used a dual-task paradigm, including a running-speed discrimination task (\u2018comparing the speed of two running silhouettes\u2019) and a change-detection task (\u2018detecting fixation-point shrinkages\u2019) assessing attention. We tested 19 school-age autistic and 19 age- and ability-matched typical participants, also recording eye-movements. The two groups presented comparable speed-discrimination abilities and, unexpectedly, comparable adaptation. Accuracy in the change-detection task and the scatter of eye-fixations around the fixation point were also similar across groups. Yet, the scatter of fixations reliably predicted the magnitude of adaptation, demonstrating the importance of controlling for attention in adaptation studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adaptation", "Autism", "Biological motion", "Perception", "Running speed"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Physiological", "Attention", "Autistic Disorder", "Female", "Fixation, Ocular", "Humans", "Male", "Motion Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074516242", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"57220260100": {"Name": "Karaminis T.", "AuthorID": "57220260100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Research inAutism and Education, UCL"}, "8870558800": {"Name": "Arrighi R.", "AuthorID": "8870558800", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience, National Research Council (CNR)"}, "7102039806": {"Name": "Burr D.", "AuthorID": "7102039806", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience, National Research Council (CNR)"}, "57203173780": {"Name": "Forth G.", "AuthorID": "57203173780", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Research inAutism and Education, UCL"}, "6507658484": {"Name": "Pellicano E.", "AuthorID": "6507658484", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Research inAutism and Education, UCL"}}}
