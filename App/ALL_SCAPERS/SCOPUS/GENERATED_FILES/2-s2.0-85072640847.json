A statistical model that predicts bandgap from chemical composition is built using supervised machine learning. The trained model forms the first in a hierarchy of screening steps. An ionic substitution algorithm is used to assign crystal structures, and an oxidation state probability model is used to discard unlikely chemistries. We demonstrate the utility of this process for screening over 1 million oxide compositions. We find that, despite the difficulties inherent to identifying stable multicomponent inorganic materials, several compounds produced by our workflow are calculated to be thermodynamically stable or metastable and have desirable optoelectronic properties according to first-principles calculations. The predicted oxides are Li2MnSiO5, MnAg(SeO3)2, and two polymorphs of MnCdGe2O6, all four of which are found to have direct electronic bandgaps in the visible range of the solar spectrum.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Chemical compositions", "Earth-abundant materials", "First-principles calculation", "High-throughput materials", "Optoelectronic properties", "Solar energy applications", "Supervised machine learning", "Thermodynamically stable"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072640847", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57192819463": {"Name": "Davies D.W.", "AuthorID": "57192819463", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Imperial College London"}, "35315151400": {"Name": "Walsh A.", "AuthorID": "35315151400", "AffiliationID": "60016912", "AffiliationName": "Global E3 Institute, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Yonsei University"}, "55423351000": {"Name": "Butler K.T.", "AuthorID": "55423351000", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "SciML, Scientific Computing Division, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}}}
