However, there is no single technique capable of measuring the three-dimensional location and electrical characteristics of these dopant nanostructures, as well as the charge dynamics of carriers and trapped charges in their vicinity. Here, we show that broadband electrostatic force microscopy can be used for non-destructive carrier profiling of atomically thin n-type (phosphorus) and p-type (boron) dopant layers in silicon, and their resulting p\u2013n junctions. The probe has a lateral resolution of 10 nm and a vertical resolution of 0.5 nm, and detects the capacitive signature of subsurface charges in a broad 1 kHz to 10 GHz frequency range. This allows the bias-dependent charge dynamics of free electrons in conducting channels and trapped charges in oxide\u2013silicon interfaces to be investigated.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Conducting channels", "Electrical characteristic", "Electrostatic force microscopy", "Lateral resolution", "Nano-scale imaging", "Precise positioning", "Three dimensional locations", "Vertical resolution"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088661908", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"35109139700": {"Name": "Gramse G.", "AuthorID": "35109139700", "AffiliationID": "60111731", "AffiliationName": "Keysight Technologies Austria GmbH, Keysight Labs"}, "55931296300": {"Name": "Kienberger F.", "AuthorID": "55931296300", "AffiliationID": "60111731", "AffiliationName": "Keysight Technologies Austria GmbH, Keysight Labs"}, "57200615732": {"Name": "K\u00f6lker A.", "AuthorID": "57200615732", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, UCL"}, "56094765000": {"Name": "Stock T.J.Z.", "AuthorID": "56094765000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, UCL"}, "6701786801": {"Name": "Curson N.J.", "AuthorID": "6701786801", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, UCL"}, "53985481500": {"Name": "\u0160kere\u0148 T.", "AuthorID": "53985481500", "AffiliationID": "60029158", "AffiliationName": "IBM Research \u2013 Zurich"}, "6603697203": {"Name": "Fuhrer A.", "AuthorID": "6603697203", "AffiliationID": "60029158", "AffiliationName": "IBM Research \u2013 Zurich"}, "7005272488": {"Name": "Aeppli G.", "AuthorID": "7005272488", "AffiliationID": "60020195", "AffiliationName": "Paul Scherrer Institut"}}}
