Achieving high spectral efficiencies is a recurring and key challenge in wireless communications systems and researchers generally use high order and advanced modulation formats to approach this problem, in particular, non-orthogonal modulation formats are a topic of particular interest. Fast orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (F-OFDM) doubles the throughput of conventional OFDM by violating orthogonality of the quadrature carrier, causing interference in the real and imaginary domains. Here, we propose a precoding scheme that enables self-interference cancellation without the need of the interference level calculation. The proposed scheme is implemented in the context of a narrowband internet-of-things (NB-IoT) system and verified on a software define radio (SDR) testbed with realistic AWGN and multiple path channels from channel emulator for concept proving. By comparing with the standard OFDM transmission, the time precoded F-OFDM outperforms around 3dB by BER with same signal-to-ratio (SNR) level.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fast OFDM", "NB-IoT waveform", "non-orthogonal", "spectrally efficient", "Time precoding"], "IndexKeywords": ["Advanced modulation formats", "High spectral efficiency", "Inter carrier interference", "Non-orthogonal", "Precoding", "spectrally efficient", "Wave forms", "Wireless communications system"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075906156", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57191579684": {"Name": "Ozan W.", "AuthorID": "57191579684", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}, "7003497031": {"Name": "Darwazeh I.", "AuthorID": "7003497031", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}, "55103012600": {"Name": "Haigh P.A.", "AuthorID": "55103012600", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Newcastle University, Intelligent Sensing and Communications Group"}, "57204725163": {"Name": "Tan B.", "AuthorID": "57204725163", "AffiliationID": "60011170", "AffiliationName": "Tampere University, Faculty of Information Technology and Communication Sciences"}}}
