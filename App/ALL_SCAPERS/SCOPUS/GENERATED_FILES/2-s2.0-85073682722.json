All rights reserved.Importance: Trifluridine/tipiracil (FTD/TPI) treatment has shown clinical benefit in patients with pretreated metastatic gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction cancer (mGC/GEJC). Patients who have undergone gastrectomy constitute a significant proportion of patients with mGC/GEJC. Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of FTD/TPI among patients with previously treated mGC/GEJC who had or had not undergone gastrectomy. Design, Setting, and Participants: This preplanned subgroup analysis of TAGS (TAS-102 Gastric Study), a phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial included patients with mGC/GEJC who had received at least 2 previous chemotherapy regimens, and was conducted at 110 academic hospitals in 17 countries in Europe, Asia, and North America, with enrollment between February 24, 2016, and January 5, 2018; the data cutoff was March 31, 2018. Interventions: Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive oral FTD/TPI 35 mg/m2 twice daily or placebo twice daily with best supportive care on days 1 through 5 and days 8 through 12 of each 28-day treatment cycle. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was overall survival. This subgroup analysis was conducted to examine potential trends and was not powered for statistical significance. Efficacy and safety end points were evaluated in the subgroups. Results: Of 507 randomized patients (369 [72.8%] male; mean [SD] age, 62.5 [10.5] years), 221 (43.6%) had undergone gastrectomy (147 randomized to FTD/TPI and 74 to placebo) and 286 (56.4%) had not undergone gastrectomy (190 randomized to FTD/TPI and 96 to placebo). In the gastrectomy subgroup, the overall survival hazard ratio (HR) in the FTD/TPI group vs placebo group was 0.57 (95% CI, 0.41-0.79), and the progression-free survival HR was 0.48 (95% CI, 0.35-0.65). In the no gastrectomy subgroup, the overall survival HR in the FTD/TPI group vs placebo group was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.60-1.06), and the progression-free survival HR was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.49-0.85). Among FTD/TPI-treated patients, grade 3 or higher adverse events of any cause occurred in 122 of 145 patients (84.1%) in the gastrectomy subgroup and 145 of 190 (76.3%) in the no gastrectomy subgroup: 64 (44.1%) in the gastrectomy subgroup and 50 (26.3%) in the no gastrectomy subgroup had grade 3 or higher neutropenia, 31 (21.4%) in the gastrectomy subgroup and 33 (17.4%) in the no gastrectomy subgroup had grade 3 or higher anemia, and 21 (14.5%) in the gastrectomy subgroup and 10 (5.3%) in the no gastrectomy subgroup hD grade 3 or higher leukopenia. In the gastrectomy subgroup, 94 (64.8%) had dosing modifications because of adverse events vs 101 (53.2%) in the no gastrectomy subgroup; 15 (10.3%) in the gastrectomy group and 28 (14.7%) in the no gastrectomy group discontinued treatment because of adverse events. Treatment exposure was similar between groups. Conclusions and Relevance: The FTD/TPI treatment was tolerable and provided efficacy benefits among patients with pretreated mGC/GEJC regardless of previous gastrectomy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073682722", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"7003453897": {"Name": "Ilson D.H.", "AuthorID": "7003453897", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Breast and Imaging Center 1031"}, "34572914800": {"Name": "Tabernero J.", "AuthorID": "34572914800", "AffiliationID": "60110094, 60012486, 60023020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}, "56443670000": {"Name": "Alsina M.", "AuthorID": "56443670000", "AffiliationID": "60110094, 60012486, 60023020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}, "57194872463": {"Name": "Prokharau A.", "AuthorID": "57194872463", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, Minsk City Clinical Oncology Dispensary"}, "6603300234": {"Name": "Arkenau H.T.", "AuthorID": "6603300234", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Drug Development Unit, Sarah Cannon Research Institute, Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "37031158100": {"Name": "Ghidini M.", "AuthorID": "37031158100", "AffiliationID": "60086768", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera di Cremona"}, "7006843495": {"Name": "Fujitani K.", "AuthorID": "7006843495", "AffiliationID": "60070977", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Osaka General Medical Center"}, "57212668756": {"Name": "Van Cutsem E.", "AuthorID": "57212668756", "AffiliationID": "60031069, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Digestive Oncology, University Hospitals Gasthuisberg Leuven, KU Leuven"}, "6602518711": {"Name": "Thuss-Patience P.", "AuthorID": "6602518711", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, Charit\u00e9-Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin"}, "7102379802": {"Name": "Beretta G.D.", "AuthorID": "7102379802", "AffiliationID": "60110893", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, Humanitas Gavazzeni"}, "15728132600": {"Name": "Mansoor W.", "AuthorID": "15728132600", "AffiliationID": "60028784", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, Christie NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57217220809": {"Name": "Zhavrid E.", "AuthorID": "57217220809", "AffiliationID": "121491784", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemotherapy, Alexandrov National Cancer Centre of Belarus"}, "7202073565": {"Name": "George B.", "AuthorID": "7202073565", "AffiliationID": "60012553", "AffiliationName": "Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin"}, "9038220300": {"Name": "Catenacci D.", "AuthorID": "9038220300", "AffiliationID": "60029278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Chicago"}, "57211373477": {"Name": "McGuigan S.", "AuthorID": "57211373477", "AffiliationID": "109398390", "AffiliationName": "Medical Affairs Division, Taiho Oncology Inc"}, "57031736500": {"Name": "Makris L.", "AuthorID": "57031736500", "AffiliationID": "120029405", "AffiliationName": "Stathmi Inc"}, "7402078774": {"Name": "Doi T.", "AuthorID": "7402078774", "AffiliationID": "60010925", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastrointestinal Oncology, National Cancer Center Hospital East"}, "12764260600": {"Name": "Shitara K.", "AuthorID": "12764260600", "AffiliationID": "60010925", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastrointestinal Oncology, National Cancer Center Hospital East"}}}
