Identification of congenital infection is often delayed; early recognition and management of congenital infections is important. Testing modalities and investigations are often limited, leading to missed diagnostic opportunities. Methods The SCORTCH (syphilis, cytomegalovirus (CMV), a other', rubella, toxoplasmosis, chickenpox, herpes simplex virus (HSV) and blood-borne viruses) acronym increases the awareness of clinicians to the increased risk of congenital syphilis, while considering other infectious aetiologies including: zika, malaria, chagas disease, parvovirus, enterovirus, HIV, hepatitis B and C, and human T-lymphotropic virus 1, in addition to the classic congenital infections recognised in the a TORCH screen' (toxoplasmosis, a other', rubella, CMV, HSV). The SCORTCH diagnostic approach describes common signs present in infants with congenital infection, details serological testing for mother and infant and important direct diagnostics of the infant. Direct diagnostic investigations include: radiology, ophthalmology, audiology, microbiological and PCR testing for both the infant and placental tissue, the latter also warrants histopathology. Conclusion The traditional a TORCH screen' focuses on serology-specific investigations, often omits important direct diagnostic testing of the infant, and fails to consider emerging and re-emerging congenital infections. In recognition of syphilis as a re-emerging pathogen and the overlapping clinical presentations of various infectious aetiologies, we advocate for a broader outlook using the SCORTCH diagnostic approach.", "AuthorKeywords": ["congenital abnorm", "infectious diseases", "microbiology", "neonatology", "virology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091762321", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"57204642779": {"Name": "Penner J.", "AuthorID": "57204642779", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Infectious Diseases, Imperial College Healthcare Nhs Trust"}, "56667780000": {"Name": "Hernstadt H.", "AuthorID": "56667780000", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Infectious Diseases, Imperial College Healthcare Nhs Trust"}, "7004180617": {"Name": "Lyall H.", "AuthorID": "7004180617", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Infectious Diseases, Imperial College Healthcare Nhs Trust"}, "57204639884": {"Name": "Burns J.E.", "AuthorID": "57204639884", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Research in Infection and Sexual Health, University College London"}, "57218255342": {"Name": "Randell P.", "AuthorID": "57218255342", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Virology, Imperial College Healthcare Nhs Trust"}}}
