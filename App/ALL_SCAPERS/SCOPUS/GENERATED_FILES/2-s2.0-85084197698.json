We aimed to identify recurrence predictors of any type of STB, and separately for SA and SI, and to analyze the time until event. A 108-subject cohort presenting at Emergencies with STB was followed during one year. Recurrence risk factors were investigated by multiple Cox survival regressions. Within one year, 31.5%, 23.1% and 9.3% patients recurred with any STB, SA, and SI respectively. Most recurrences (~70%) occurred within the first 6 months. Seeking emergency psychiatric assistance for problems other than STB during follow-up was a common predictor for recurrence of any STB, and SA and SI specifically. Previous SA history and contact with psychiatry outpatient units during follow-up predicted both STB in general and SA in particular. A specific predictor for SA was hospitalization at index, while SI recurrence was associated to SI at index. These results highlight the importance of early intervention and multidisciplinary follow-up considering concurrent psychosocial or adaptive problems. A careful exploration at Emergencies is needed to target potential predictors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attempted suicide", "Cohort study", "Follow-up studies", "Risk factors", "Secondary prevention", "Self-injurious behavior", "Suicidal ideation", "Suicidal thoughts and behaviors", "Suicide"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Outpatients", "Pilot Projects", "Prospective Studies", "Recurrence", "Risk Factors", "Suicidal Ideation", "Suicide, Attempted"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084197698", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"55459141600": {"Name": "Su\u00e1rez-Pinilla P.", "AuthorID": "55459141600", "AffiliationID": "60104561", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red de Salud Mental (CIBERSAM)"}, "57216653147": {"Name": "P\u00e9rez-Herrera M.", "AuthorID": "57216653147", "AffiliationID": "60020591", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital Marqu\u00e9s de Valdecilla, IDIVAL"}, "57216658443": {"Name": "Medina-Blanco R.", "AuthorID": "57216658443", "AffiliationID": "60020591", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital Marqu\u00e9s de Valdecilla, IDIVAL"}, "57216653698": {"Name": "L\u00f3pez-Garc\u00eda E.", "AuthorID": "57216653698", "AffiliationID": "60020591", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital Marqu\u00e9s de Valdecilla, IDIVAL"}, "6508181144": {"Name": "Artal-Sim\u00f3n J.\u00c1.", "AuthorID": "6508181144", "AffiliationID": "60020591", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital Marqu\u00e9s de Valdecilla, IDIVAL"}, "57216658081": {"Name": "de Santiago-D\u00edaz A.I.", "AuthorID": "57216658081", "AffiliationID": "60020591", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital Marqu\u00e9s de Valdecilla, IDIVAL"}, "56009170700": {"Name": "Su\u00e1rez-Pinilla M.", "AuthorID": "56009170700", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenertive Diseases UCL Queen Square, Institute of Neurology"}}}
