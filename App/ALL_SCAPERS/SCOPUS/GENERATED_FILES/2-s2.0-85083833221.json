Levodopa (L-dopa) is an effective medication for alleviating motor symptoms in PD that has been shown previously to reduce subcortical beta (13\u201330 Hz) oscillations. How L-dopa influences oscillations in the motor cortex is unclear. In this study, 21 PD patients were recorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG) in L-dopa ON and OFF states. Oscillatory components of resting-state power spectra were compared between the two states and the significant effect was localized using beamforming. Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) III akinesia and rigidity sub-scores for the most affected hemibody were correlated with source power values for the contralateral hemisphere. An L-dopa-induced power increase was found over the central sensors significant in the 18\u201330 Hz range (F(1,20) > 14.8, PFWE corr < 0.05, cluster size inference with P = 0.001 cluster-forming threshold). Beamforming localization of this effect revealed distinct peaks at the bilateral sensorimotor cortex. A significant correlation between the magnitude of L-dopa induced 18\u201330 Hz oscillatory motor-cortical power increase and the degree of improvement in contralateral akinesia and rigidity was found (F(2, 19) = 4.9, pone-tailed = 0.02, R2 = 0.2). Power in the same range was also inversely correlated with combined akinesia and rigidity scores in the L-dopa OFF state (F(2, 19) = 9.2, ptwo-tailed = 0.007, R2 = 0.33) but not in the L-dopa ON state (F(2, 19) = 0.27, ptwo-tailed = 0.6, R2 = 0.01). These results suggest that the role of motor cortical beta oscillations in PD is distinct from that of subcortical beta.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cortex", "Dopamine", "Human", "M1", "Movement disorders"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083833221", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"55215311800": {"Name": "Cao C.", "AuthorID": "55215311800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "8389402100": {"Name": "Li D.", "AuthorID": "8389402100", "AffiliationID": "60082819, 60024452", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Affiliated Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine"}, "7004544002": {"Name": "Zhan S.", "AuthorID": "7004544002", "AffiliationID": "60082819, 60024452", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Affiliated Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine"}, "57192310868": {"Name": "Zhang C.", "AuthorID": "57192310868", "AffiliationID": "60082819, 60024452", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Affiliated Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine"}, "8557014100": {"Name": "Sun B.", "AuthorID": "8557014100", "AffiliationID": "60082819, 60024452", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Affiliated Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine"}, "23995713600": {"Name": "Litvak V.", "AuthorID": "23995713600", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}}}
