We describe a coupled ptychography-tomography reconstruction algorithm and apply it to an experimental ptychographic x-ray computed tomography data set of a catalyst particle. Compared to the traditional sequential algorithm, in which ptychographic projections are reconstructed to serve as input for subsequent tomographic reconstruction, the coupled ptychography-tomography algorithm reconstructs the 3D volume with higher spatial resolution over a larger field of view. Coupling the data from different projections improves the overall reconstruction, and the ptychographic sampling in individual projections can be coarsened beyond the point of overlap between neighboring scan points, still leading to stable reconstructions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Catalyst particles", "Numerical reconstruction", "Sequential algorithm", "Threedimensional (3-d)", "Tomographic reconstruction", "Tomography algorithm", "Tomography reconstruction", "X-ray computed tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074542087", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57190940018": {"Name": "Kahnt M.", "AuthorID": "57190940018", "AffiliationID": "60028229", "AffiliationName": "Department Physik, Universit\u00e4t Hamburg"}, "57194858717": {"Name": "Br\u00fcckner D.", "AuthorID": "57194858717", "AffiliationID": "60005322", "AffiliationName": "Ruhr-University Bochum"}, "56378456200": {"Name": "Wittwer F.", "AuthorID": "56378456200", "AffiliationID": "60028229", "AffiliationName": "Department Physik, Universit\u00e4t Hamburg"}, "7004115938": {"Name": "Schroer C.", "AuthorID": "7004115938", "AffiliationID": "60028229", "AffiliationName": "Department Physik, Universit\u00e4t Hamburg"}, "56672199600": {"Name": "Sheppard T.", "AuthorID": "56672199600", "AffiliationID": "60102538", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Chemical Technology and Polymer Chemistry, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology"}, "7004034008": {"Name": "Grunwaldt J.", "AuthorID": "7004034008", "AffiliationID": "60102538", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Chemical Technology and Polymer Chemistry, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology"}, "57210888079": {"Name": "Becher J.", "AuthorID": "57210888079", "AffiliationID": "60102538", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Chemical Technology and Polymer Chemistry, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology"}, "56328746100": {"Name": "Fam Y.", "AuthorID": "56328746100", "AffiliationID": "60102538", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Chemical Technology and Polymer Chemistry, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology"}, "56464262700": {"Name": "Weissenberger T.", "AuthorID": "56464262700", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemical Reaction Engineering, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg"}, "7005555389": {"Name": "Schwieger W.", "AuthorID": "7005555389", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemical Reaction Engineering, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg"}}}
