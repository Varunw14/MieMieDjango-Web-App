The two research questions are: What makes evaluation a powerful instrument affecting the governance of universities? Do different evaluation instruments have different strengths in affecting governance? We assume that evaluation has several areas of potential effect on universities related to transformation of: hierarchical relationships between actors; the academic profession; management and performance. The chapter surveys relevant literature, followed by an outline of the conceptual framework, a presentation of the data used and the tests developed, and data analysis. We attempt to identify homogenous clusters of higher education institutions (HEIs) in terms of the extent to which evaluation influences their governance, before our concluding discussion of the analytical results and the conclusions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086459660", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"55391417300": {"Name": "Reale E.", "AuthorID": "55391417300", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute on Sustainable Economic Growth IRCRES, National Research Council CNR"}, "57188987130": {"Name": "Marini G.", "AuthorID": "57188987130", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Global Higher Education, Institute of Education, UCL"}}}
