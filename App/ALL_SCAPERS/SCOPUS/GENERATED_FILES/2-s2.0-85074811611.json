We piloted an adapted active visualization device that demonstrates how ART works in the body. Youth living with HIV were randomized to: (1) standard care (n = 14) or the (2) adapted active visualization intervention (n = 14) and 71% of the sample (n = 19) were re-assessed on viral load, adherence behaviors, and illness perceptions 2.5 months later. Intervention youth had lower viral loads, reported less difficulty in adhering to ART, and more motivation and control over their HIV than standard care at follow-up. Active visualization may be an acceptable tool to address ART adherence among youth.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antiretroviral therapy", "Medication adherence", "Multisensory learning", "Viral load", "Youth living with HIV"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Anti-HIV Agents", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Medication Adherence", "Motivation", "Viral Load"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074811611", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57191572932": {"Name": "Christodoulou J.", "AuthorID": "57191572932", "AffiliationID": "60006511, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry & Biobehavioral Sciences, Semel Institute, University of California Los Angeles"}, "7006796649": {"Name": "Rotheram-Borus M.J.", "AuthorID": "7006796649", "AffiliationID": "60006511, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry & Biobehavioral Sciences, Semel Institute, University of California Los Angeles"}, "6603248445": {"Name": "Abdalian S.E.", "AuthorID": "6603248445", "AffiliationID": "60017672", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, Tulane University"}, "56918930900": {"Name": "Jones A.S.K.", "AuthorID": "56918930900", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Medicine, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, University of Auckland"}, "57195278149": {"Name": "Christodoulou G.", "AuthorID": "57195278149", "AffiliationID": "60015183, 60029311", "AffiliationName": "Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California"}, "6602427335": {"Name": "Pentoney S.L.", "AuthorID": "6602427335", "AffiliationID": "112687208", "AffiliationName": "Organovo, Inc."}}}
