This paper systematically compares the effect of social-cultural context on soundscape of urban public open spaces in China and Croatia. Eleven well-known and typical squares were selected. A series of questionnaire surveys within the soundscape framework were carried out during the summer season, and gathered data were analyzed. Principal component analysis (PCA) resulted in two principal components, eventfulness and pleasantness, as notable soundscape factors. However, eventfulness is the major factor in China, and pleasantness is the major factor in Croatia. In terms of environmental satisfaction, natural condition is the major factor based on PCA. Urban condition is the second factor in China, however, it is the third factor in Croatia. It is interesting to note that the physical environment is the most important factor in Croatian inland and coastal places, which is different compared to Chinese places. Visit purpose is the dominant factor associated with sound and environmental satisfaction. Natural sound and children have mainly positive correlations to sound and environmental satisfaction in China, whereas sounds of human activities have mainly negative correlations to sound and environmental satisfaction in Croatia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cross-national", "Public open spaces", "Soundscape", "Soundscape framework"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081595489", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Process Chemistry and Technology", "CENG", "1508"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes", "CENG", "1507"]], "AuthorData": {"57215672387": {"Name": "Deng L.", "AuthorID": "57215672387", "AffiliationID": "60019616", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, Harbin Institute of Technology, Key Laboratory of Cold Region Urban and Rural Human Settlement Environment Science and Technology"}, "55485135500": {"Name": "Kang J.", "AuthorID": "55485135500", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering, The Bartlett, University College London"}, "57214918328": {"Name": "Zhao W.", "AuthorID": "57214918328", "AffiliationID": "60019616", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, Harbin Institute of Technology, Key Laboratory of Cold Region Urban and Rural Human Settlement Environment Science and Technology"}, "26662090200": {"Name": "Jambro\u0161i\u0107 K.", "AuthorID": "26662090200", "AffiliationID": "60008408", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electroacoustics, University of Zagreb"}}}
