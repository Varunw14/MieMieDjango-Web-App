Drawing on a two-year UK study and Holland et al.\u2019s [1998. Identity and Agency in Cultural Worlds. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press ] framing of agency, culture and identity making across \u2018figured worlds\u2019, we consider the importance of informal studying and socio-academic practices and the role of digital technologies in fostering agency and identity making. The significance of this study lies in revealing the particular importance of improvisation and collective agency for under-represented students participating in university. Whilst acknowledging that the technologies can also reproduce social inequalities, we conclude that, through the increasing interconnectedness of academic and social interactions, the digital improvisations offer creative opportunities for students to negotiate spatial, social and academic inequalities and lead to new/alternative identities and develop stronger social, cultural and educational capital.", "AuthorKeywords": ["agency", "digital cultures", "social networks", "Widening participation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075920221", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"36656307600": {"Name": "Timmis S.", "AuthorID": "36656307600", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Education, University of Bristol"}, "56338726300": {"Name": "Mu\u00f1oz-Chereau B.", "AuthorID": "56338726300", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
