Wound dressings may reduce SSI. Objective: To assess the feasibility of a multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of dressing types or no dressing to reduce SSI in primary surgical wounds. Design: Phase A \u2013 semistructured interviews, outcome measure development, practice survey, literature reviews and value-of-information analysis. Phase B \u2013 pilot RCT with qualitative research and questionnaire validation. Patients and the public were involved. Setting: Usual NHS care. Participants: Patients undergoing elective/non-elective abdominal surgery, including caesarean section. Interventions: Phase A \u2013 none. Phase B \u2013 simple dressing, glue-as-a-dressing (tissue adhesive) or \u2018no dressing\u2019. Main outcome measures: Phase A \u2013 pilot RCT design; SSI, patient experience and wound management questionnaires; dressing practices; and value-of-information of a RCT. Phase B \u2013 participants screened, proportions consented/randomised; acceptability of interventions; adherence; retention; validity and reliability of SSI measure; and cost drivers. Data sources: Phase A \u2013 interviews with patients and health-care professionals (HCPs), narrative data from published RCTs and data about dressing practices. Phase B \u2013 participants and HCPs in five hospitals. Results: Phase A \u2013 we interviewed 102 participants. HCPs interpreted \u2018dressing\u2019 variably and reported using available products. HCPs suggested practical/clinical reasons for dressing use, acknowledged the weak evidence base and felt that a RCT including a \u2018no dressing\u2019 group was acceptable. A survey showed that 68% of 1769 wounds (727 participants) had simple dressings and 27% had glue-as-a-dressing. Dressings were used similarly in elective and non-elective surgery. The SSI questionnaire was developed from a content analysis of existing SSI tools and interviews, yielding 19 domains and 16 items. A main RCT would be valuable to the NHS at a willingness to pay of \u00a320,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Phase B \u2013 from 4 March 2016 to 30 November 2016, we approached 862 patients for the pilot RCT; 81.1% were eligible, 59.4% consented and 394 were randomised (simple, n = 133; glue, n = 129; no dressing, n = 132); non-adherence was 3 out of 133, 8 out of 129 and 20 out of 132, respectively. SSI occurred in 51 out of 281 participants. We interviewed 55 participants. All dressing strategies were acceptable to stakeholders, with no indication that adherence was problematic. Adherence aids and patients\u2019 understanding of their allocated dressing appeared to be key. The SSI questionnaire response rate overall was 67.2%. Items in the SSI questionnaire fitted a single scale, which had good reliability (test\u2013retest and Cronbach\u2019s alpha of > 0.7) and diagnostic accuracy (c-statistic = 0.906). The key cost drivers were hospital appointments, dressings and redressings, use of new medicines and primary care appointments. Limitations: Multiple activities, often in parallel, were challenging to co-ordinate. An amendment took 4 months, restricting recruitment to the pilot RCT. Only 67% of participants completed the SSI questionnaire. We could not implement photography in theatres. Conclusions: A main RCT of dressing strategies is feasible and would be valuable to the NHS. The SSI questionnaire is sufficiently accurate to be used as the primary outcome. A main trial with three groups (as in the pilot) would be valuable to the NHS, using a primary outcome of SSI at discharge and patient-reported SSI symptoms at 4\u20138 weeks.
