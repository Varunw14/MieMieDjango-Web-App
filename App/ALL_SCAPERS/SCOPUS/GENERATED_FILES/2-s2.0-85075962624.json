All rights reserved.Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive nervous degeneration. Because of the diversity of clinical symptoms and onset age, the diagnosis of this disease is difficult. Therefore, biomarker tests have attracted significant attention for earlier diagnostics. In this study, we developed a simultaneous analysis method for five urinary conjugated cholesterol metabolites, which are potential diagnostic biomarkers for a rapid, convenient, and noninvasive chemical diagnosis, using LC/MS/MS. By the method, their urinary concentrations were quantified and the NPC diagnostic performances were evaluated. The developed LC/MS/MS method showed high accuracy and satisfied all analytical method validation criteria. When the urine of healthy controls and patients with NPC was analyzed, three of five urinary conjugated cholesterol metabolite concentrations corrected by urinary creatinine were significantly higher in the patients with NPC. As a result of receiver operating characteristics analysis, these urinary metabolites might have excellent diagnostic marker performance. 3\u03b2-Sulfooxy-7\u03b2-hydroxy-5-cholenoic acid showed particularly excellent diagnostic performance with both 100% clinical sensitivity and specificity, suggesting that it is a useful NPC diagnostic marker. The urinary conjugated cholesterol metabolites exhibited high NPC diagnostic marker performance and could be used for NPC diagnosis. 2019 Maekawa et al.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry", "Niemann-Pick disease type C", "Urinary biomarkers"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Calibration", "Case-Control Studies", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cholesterol", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Niemann-Pick Disease, Type C", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075962624", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"54585732100": {"Name": "Maekawa M.", "AuthorID": "54585732100", "AffiliationID": "60011374", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tohoku University Hospital"}, "25229230400": {"Name": "Saigusa D.", "AuthorID": "25229230400", "AffiliationID": "60008435", "AffiliationName": "Department of Integrative Genomics, Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization, Tohoku University"}, "35316571500": {"Name": "Yamaguchi H.", "AuthorID": "35316571500", "AffiliationID": "60008435", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tohoku University"}, "7004960559": {"Name": "Mano N.", "AuthorID": "7004960559", "AffiliationID": "60008435", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tohoku University"}, "57207762132": {"Name": "Jinnoh I.", "AuthorID": "57207762132", "AffiliationID": "60008435", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tohoku University"}, "57211508595": {"Name": "Iwahori A.", "AuthorID": "57211508595", "AffiliationID": "60008435", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tohoku University"}, "55838079900": {"Name": "Narita A.", "AuthorID": "55838079900", "AffiliationID": "60012372", "AffiliationName": "Division of Child Neurology, Tottori University Hospital"}, "35406883200": {"Name": "Ohno K.", "AuthorID": "35406883200", "AffiliationID": "60012372", "AffiliationName": "Division of Child Neurology, Tottori University Hospital"}, "35460411000": {"Name": "Iida T.", "AuthorID": "35460411000", "AffiliationID": "60002561", "AffiliationName": "College of Humanities and Sciences, Nihon University"}, "57189705778": {"Name": "Nittono H.", "AuthorID": "57189705778", "AffiliationID": "112852120", "AffiliationName": "Junshin Clinic Bile Acid Institute"}, "7202906362": {"Name": "Okuyama T.", "AuthorID": "7202906362", "AffiliationID": "60104703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, National Center for Child Health and Development"}, "36164008100": {"Name": "Eto Y.", "AuthorID": "36164008100", "AffiliationID": "113837155", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Clinical Research Center, Institute for Neurological Disorders"}, "26643542700": {"Name": "Clayton P.T.", "AuthorID": "26643542700", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Biochemistry Research Group, Clinical and Molecular Genetics Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health"}}}
