As one of the major light element candidates, sulfur has attracted extensive interests for measuring its partitioning and phase behaviors over the last several decades, but the relevant experimental data under Earth's core conditions are still scarce. In this study, using a toolkit consisting of electronic structure theory, high-accuracy machine learning potentials and rigorous free energy calculations, we establish an efficient and extendible framework for predicting complex phase behaviors of iron alloys under extreme conditions. As a first application of this framework, we predict the partition coefficients of sulfur over wide range of temperatures and pressures (from 4000 K, 150 GPa to 6000 K, 330 GPa), which are demonstrated to be in good agreement with previous experiments and ab initio simulations. After a continuous increase below \u223c250 GPa, the partition coefficient is found to be around 0.75 \u00b1 0.07 at higher pressures and are essentially temperature-independent. Given these predictions, the partitioning of sulfur is confirmed to be insufficient to account for the observed density jump across the Earth's inner core boundary and its roles on the geodynamics of the Earth's core should be minor.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Density functional theory", "Earth's core", "First principles", "Light elements", "Machine learning", "Partition coefficient", "Sulfur"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082850299", "SubjectAreas": [["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"55613239699": {"Name": "Zhang Z.", "AuthorID": "55613239699", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "College of Earth and Planetary Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "6602577617": {"Name": "Cs\u00e1nyi G.", "AuthorID": "6602577617", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge"}, "7004035504": {"Name": "Alf\u00e8 D.", "AuthorID": "7004035504", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Fisica \u201cEttore Pancini,\u201d Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Napoli \u201cFederico II, \u201d Complesso di Monte S.
