The quality of reconstructions depends heavily on the quality of the collected data, except that, in the traditional process of imaging, the expert has very little influence over the acquisition parameters, experimental plan or the collected data. It is often the case that the expert has to draw limited conclusions from the reconstructions, or adapt a research question to data available. This method of imaging is static and sequential, and limits the potential of tomography as a research tool. In this paper, we propose a more dynamic process of imaging where experiments are tailored around a sample or the research question; intermediate reconstructions and analysis are available almost instantaneously, and expert has input at any stage of the process (including during acquisition) to improve acquisition or image reconstruction. Through various applications of 2D, 3D and dynamic 3D imaging at the FleX-ray Laboratory, we present the unexpected journey of exploration a research question undergoes, and the surprising benefits it yields.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Computed tomography", "Live image reconstruction", "Novel imaging systems", "Tomographic data acquisition"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085070478", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57190261284": {"Name": "Coban S.B.", "AuthorID": "57190261284", "AffiliationID": "60011575", "AffiliationName": "Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica"}, "52364146500": {"Name": "Lucka F.", "AuthorID": "52364146500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "22433580500": {"Name": "Palenstijn W.J.", "AuthorID": "22433580500", "AffiliationID": "60011575", "AffiliationName": "Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica"}, "55879451400": {"Name": "Batenburg K.J.", "AuthorID": "55879451400", "AffiliationID": "100333371", "AffiliationName": "Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science"}, "24544982400": {"Name": "Van Loo D.", "AuthorID": "24544982400", "AffiliationID": "60175983", "AffiliationName": "TESCAN-XRE NV"}}}
