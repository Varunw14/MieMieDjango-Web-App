American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.We describe a new method of constructing an equilibrium magnetopause surface based on the pressure balance between external and internal pressure sources. Details are given for every step of the procedure, including the initial pressure balance condition (which determines magnetopause morphology), the related underlying assumptions, and the final optimized magnetopause surface. Our method produces a final equilibrium magnetopause surface that satisfies the local balance between the solar wind dynamic pressure and planetary magnetic pressure with an error no greater than 1%. We also discuss the contribution of hot plasma pressure and equatorial ring currents and their effects on magnetopause morphology. For each optimized magnetopause boundary, we give coefficients for fitted polynomial approximations to allow simple and accurate reproductions for practical applications. We specifically discuss the potential application to the modeling of Saturn's magnetopause and describe how the equilibrium magnetopause model can be used to estimate the compressibility of the boundary.", "AuthorKeywords": ["magnetopause", "polar cusp", "pressure balance", "Saturn", "solar wind"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071368201", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Forestry", "AGRI", "1107"], ["Oceanography", "EART", "1910"], ["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"], ["Soil Science", "AGRI", "1111"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"], ["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"], ["Paleontology", "EART", "1911"]], "AuthorData": {"57194716215": {"Name": "Hardy F.", "AuthorID": "57194716215", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60162133", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Planetary Sciences at UCL/Birkbeck"}, "6602674743": {"Name": "Achilleos N.", "AuthorID": "6602674743", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60162133", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Planetary Sciences at UCL/Birkbeck"}, "6602350743": {"Name": "Guio P.", "AuthorID": "6602350743", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60162133", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Planetary Sciences at UCL/Birkbeck"}}}
