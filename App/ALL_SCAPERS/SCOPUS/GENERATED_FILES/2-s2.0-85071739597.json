This review summarises the different ability measures used previously, focusing on tests of intelligence quotient (IQ) and adaptive behaviour (AB), and where possible examines floor effects and differences between DS subpopulations. We aimed to use information regarding existing measures to provide recommendations for individual researchers and the DS research community. Results: Nineteen studies reporting IQ test data met inclusion for this review, with 17 different IQ tests used. Twelve of these IQ tests were used in only one study while five were used in two different studies. Eleven studies reporting AB test data met inclusion for this review, with seven different AB tests used. The only AB scales to be used by more than one study were the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scale (VABS; used by three studies) and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale 2nd Edition (VABS-II; used by two studies). A variety of additional factors were identified which make comparison of test scores between studies problematic, including different score types provided between studies (e.g. raw scores compared to age-equivalent scores) and different participant inclusion criteria (e.g. whether individuals with cognitive decline were excluded). Floor effects were common for IQ tests (particularly for standardised test scores). Data exists to suggest that floor effects may be minimised by the use of raw test scores rather than standardised test scores. Raw scores may, therefore, be particularly useful in longitudinal studies to track change in cognitive ability over time. Conclusions: Studies assessing general ability in adults with DS are likely to benefit from the use of both IQ and AB scales. The DS research community may benefit from the development of reporting standards for IQ and AB data, and from the sharing of raw study data enabling further in-depth investigation of issues highlighted by this review.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AB", "Adaptive ability", "Adaptive behaviour", "Cognition", "Down syndrome", "General ability", "Intelligence", "IQ"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Psychological", "Aptitude", "Down Syndrome", "Humans", "Intelligence", "Intelligence Tests"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071739597", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"57189298391": {"Name": "Hamburg S.", "AuthorID": "57189298391", "AffiliationID": "115862034", "AffiliationName": "London Down Syndrome Consortium (LonDownS)"}, "48663029800": {"Name": "Startin C.M.", "AuthorID": "48663029800", "AffiliationID": "115862034", "AffiliationName": "London Down Syndrome Consortium (LonDownS)"}, "56079439400": {"Name": "Strydom A.", "AuthorID": "56079439400", "AffiliationID": "115862034", "AffiliationName": "London Down Syndrome Consortium (LonDownS)"}, "57205660102": {"Name": "Lowe B.", "AuthorID": "57205660102", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Loughborough University"}, "55743944800": {"Name": "Padilla C.", "AuthorID": "55743944800", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Herchel Smith Building for Brain and Mind Sciences"}, "7006571816": {"Name": "Zaman S.", "AuthorID": "7006571816", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Herchel Smith Building for Brain and Mind Sciences"}, "6506026305": {"Name": "Coppus A.", "AuthorID": "6506026305", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary and Community Care, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "34573439400": {"Name": "Silverman W.", "AuthorID": "34573439400", "AffiliationID": "60007278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, University of California"}, "36171423000": {"Name": "Fortea J.", "AuthorID": "36171423000", "AffiliationID": "60085102", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red de Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas, CIBERNED"}, "7005966043": {"Name": "Head E.", "AuthorID": "7005966043", "AffiliationID": "60027155, 60015941", "AffiliationName": "Sanders-Brown Center on Aging, University of Kentucky"}, "6603912397": {"Name": "Handen B.L.", "AuthorID": "6603912397", "AffiliationID": "60001361", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine"}, "7004637783": {"Name": "Lott I.", "AuthorID": "7004637783", "AffiliationID": "60007278", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Pediatrics and Neurology, University of California"}, "7401655359": {"Name": "Song W.", "AuthorID": "7401655359", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Townsend Family Laboratories, Department of Psychiatry, University of British Columbia, 2255 Wesbrook Mall"}}}
