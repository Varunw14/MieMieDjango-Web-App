Highly effective treatment has recently been made available to all Australians living with HCV. A decision-analytic model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the hepatology partnership, compared to usual care. A Markov model was chosen, as it is state-based and able to include recursive events, which accurately reflects the natural history of the chronic and repetitive nature of HCV. Cost-effectiveness of the new model of care is indicated by the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), where the mean change to costs associated with the new model of care is divided by the mean change in quality adjusted life-years (QALYs). Ten thousand iterations of the model were run, with the majority (73%) of ICERs representing cost-savings. In comparison to usual care, the intervention improves health outcomes (22.38 QALYs gained) and reduces costs by $42,122 per patient. When compared to usual care, a partnership approach to management of HCV is cost-effective and good value for money, even when key model parameters are changed in scenario analyses. Reduction in costs is driven by improved efficiency of the new model of care, where more patients are treated in a timely manner, away from the expensive tertiary setting. From an economic perspective, a reduction in hospital-based care is a positive outcome and represents a good investment for decision-makers who wish to maximise health gain per dollar spent.
