Recently, deep learning has shown promise in allowing accurate residue-residue contact prediction even for shallow sequence alignments. Here we introduce DMPfold, which uses deep learning to predict inter-atomic distance bounds, the main chain hydrogen bond network, and torsion angles, which it uses to build models in an iterative fashion. DMPfold produces more accurate models than two popular methods for a test set of CASP12 domains, and works just as well for transmembrane proteins. Applied to all Pfam domains without known structures, confident models for 25% of these so-called dark families were produced in under a week on a small 200 core cluster. DMPfold provides models for 16% of human proteome UniProt entries without structures, generates accurate models with fewer than 100 sequences in some cases, and is freely available.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Animals", "Binding Sites", "Computational Biology", "Deep Learning", "Humans", "Models, Molecular", "Protein Conformation", "Proteome", "Proteomics", "Reproducibility of Results"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071738414", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56913110700": {"Name": "Greener J.G.", "AuthorID": "56913110700", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "The Francis Crick Institute"}, "55748763500": {"Name": "Kandathil S.M.", "AuthorID": "55748763500", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "The Francis Crick Institute"}, "57203189821": {"Name": "Jones D.T.", "AuthorID": "57203189821", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "The Francis Crick Institute"}}}
