These reactions play important roles in both long-term (primarily abiotic) and short-term (primarily biotic) carbon cycling. Long-term cycling is important in the subsurface and at subduction zones where organic carbon is decomposed and outgassed or recycled back to the mantle. Short-term reactions are driven by biology and have the ability to rapidly convert CO2 to biomass and vice versa. For instance, carboxylation is a critical reaction in primary production and metabolic pathways like photosynthesis in which sunlight provides energy to drive carbon fixation, whereas decarboxylation is a critical reaction in metabolic pathways like respiration and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Early life and prebiotic chemistry on Earth likely relied heavily upon the abiotic synthesis of carboxylic acids. Over time, life has diversified (de)carboxylation reactions and incorporated them into many facets of cellular metabolism. Here we present a broad overview of the importance of carboxylation and decarboxylation reactions from both abiotic and biotic perspectives to highlight the importance of these reactions and compounds to planetary evolution.", "AuthorKeywords": ["A Deep Carbon Perspective", "biological carbon cycling", "carboxylation", "Decarboxylation", "early Earth", "Earth in Five Reactions", "subduction recycling"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084749788", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"24765192700": {"Name": "Sheik C.S.", "AuthorID": "24765192700", "AffiliationID": "60009875", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology and the Large Lakes Observatory, University of Minnesota Duluth"}, "6602356238": {"Name": "Cleaves H.J.", "AuthorID": "6602356238", "AffiliationID": "60170182", "AffiliationName": "Blue Marble Space Institute of Science"}, "57216807094": {"Name": "Johnson-Finn K.", "AuthorID": "57216807094", "AffiliationID": "60031126", "AffiliationName": "Earth-Life Science Institute, Tokyo Institute of Technology"}, "8591583200": {"Name": "Giovannelli D.", "AuthorID": "8591583200", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Marine Biological and Biotechnological Resources, National Research Council of Italy, CNR-IRBIM"}, "7003863091": {"Name": "Kieft T.L.", "AuthorID": "7003863091", "AffiliationID": "60028844", "AffiliationName": "New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology"}, "9638888200": {"Name": "Papineau D.", "AuthorID": "9638888200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60162133, 60009016", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Planetary Sciences, University College London, Birkbeck University of London"}, "7004583109": {"Name": "Schrenk M.O.", "AuthorID": "7004583109", "AffiliationID": "60031707", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Michigan State University"}, "8714569100": {"Name": "Tumiati S.", "AuthorID": "8714569100", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra, University of Milan"}}}
