Methods: The Ixcellence Network training program was designed by a scientific committee of 6 experts and then tested at centers in Europe, and Latin America. The training, provided by 16 experienced neurologists and rehabilitation specialists, consisted of theoretic and practical sessions that covered the different stages of the patient's journey from diagnosis to tailored treatment and rehabilitation. Trainees' feedback and the impact on participants' practice were evaluated by 2 individual questionnaires, at the end of the session (T0) and at 6 months (T6). Trainers' feedback was also collected through an individual questionnaire. Findings: Between September 2012 and December 2017, 728 trained physicians participated in training programs with 48%, 23%, and 29% of attendees participating in training sessions dedicated to adult spastic paresis, child spastic paresis, and cervical dystonia, respectively. At T0, 93% of attendees thought that they had been given new information and 90% thought that the training would change their daily practice. This was confirmed at T6 by 93% of respondents. Trainees were highly satisfied with the program, in particular with the practical sessions. Trainers expectations were met for attendees' level of expertise, motivation, language, and participation. Implications: In this descriptive study, we show that the Ixcellence Network program represents a new educational approach to promote consistency in care practices and dissemination of expertise on the use of BoNT-A for neurologic disorders.
