Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Sexual development involves the successive and overlapping processes of sex determination, sexual differentiation, and ultimately sexual maturation, enabling animals to reproduce. This provides a mechanism for enriched genetic variation which enables populations to withstand ever-changing environments, selecting for adapted individuals and driving speciation. The molecular mechanisms of sexual development display a bewildering diversity, even in closely related taxa. Many sex determination mechanisms across animals include the key family of \u201cdoublesex- and male abnormal3-related transcription factors\u201d (Dmrts). In a few exceptional species, a single Dmrt residing on a sex chromosome acts as the master sex regulator. In this study, we provide compelling evidence for this model of sex determination in the ornate spiny lobster Panulius ornatus, concurrent with recent reports in the eastern spiny lobster Sagmariasus verreauxi. Using a multi-tissue transcriptomic database established for P. ornatus, we screened for the key factors associated with sexual development (by homology search and using previous knowledge of these factors from related species), providing an in-depth understanding of sexual development in decapods. Further research has the potential to close significant gaps in our understanding of reproductive development in this ecologically and commercially significant order.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Decapod crustaceans", "Doublesex and MAB-3 related transcription factors", "Sex-linked master sex regulator", "Sexual development", "Transcriptome"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091793440", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"7006475620": {"Name": "Ventura T.", "AuthorID": "7006475620", "AffiliationID": "60032607", "AffiliationName": "GeneCology Research Centre, School of Science and Engineering, University of the Sunshine Coast (USC)"}, "56623966200": {"Name": "Chandler J.C.", "AuthorID": "56623966200", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "56991765700": {"Name": "Nguyen T.V.", "AuthorID": "56991765700", "AffiliationID": "60106162, 60110582", "AffiliationName": "Agriculture Victoria, AgriBio, Centre for AgriBiosciences"}, "57203816543": {"Name": "Hyde C.J.", "AuthorID": "57203816543", "AffiliationID": "60032607", "AffiliationName": "GeneCology Research Centre, School of Science and Engineering, University of the Sunshine Coast (USC)"}, "7005760428": {"Name": "Elizur A.", "AuthorID": "7005760428", "AffiliationID": "60032607", "AffiliationName": "GeneCology Research Centre, School of Science and Engineering, University of the Sunshine Coast (USC)"}, "12782761600": {"Name": "Fitzgibbon Q.P.", "AuthorID": "12782761600", "AffiliationID": "60190740, 60015356", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS), University of Tasmania"}, "56172162800": {"Name": "Smith G.G.", "AuthorID": "56172162800", "AffiliationID": "60190740, 60015356", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS), University of Tasmania"}}}
