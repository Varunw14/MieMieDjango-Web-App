Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Presenting many advantages, solid oral dosage forms (SODFs) are widely manufactured and frequently prescribed in older populations regardless of the specific characteristics of patients. Commonly, patients with dysphagia (swallowing disorders) experience difficulties taking SODFs, which may lead to non-adherence or misuse. SODF characteristics (e.g., size, shape, thickness) are likely to influence swallowability. Herein, we used the acceptability reference framework (the ClinSearch acceptability score test (CAST))\u2014a 3D-map juxtaposing two acceptability profiles\u2014to investigate the impact of tablet size on acceptability. We collected 938 observer reports on the tablet intake by patients \u226565 years in hospitals or care homes. As we might expect, tablets could be classified as accepted in older patients without dysphagia (n = 790), while not in those with swallowing disorders (n = 146). However, reducing the tablet size had a significant impact on acceptability in this subpopulation: tablets <6.5 mm appeared to be accepted by patients with swallowing disorders. Among the 309 distinct tablets assessed in this study, ranging in size from 4.7 to 21.5 mm, 83% are \u22656.5 mm and consequently may be poorly accepted by institutionalized older people and older inpatients suffering from dysphagia. This underlines the need to develop and prescribe medicines with the best adapted characteristics to reach an optimal acceptability in targeted users.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acceptability", "CAST (ClinSearch acceptability score test)", "Formulation", "Medicine", "Older population", "Size", "SODF"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090638847", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"57148095200": {"Name": "Vallet T.", "AuthorID": "57148095200", "AffiliationID": "119066717", "AffiliationName": "ClinSearch"}, "57218893673": {"Name": "Fur A.L.", "AuthorID": "57218893673", "AffiliationID": "119066717", "AffiliationName": "ClinSearch"}, "57190863906": {"Name": "Ruiz F.", "AuthorID": "57190863906", "AffiliationID": "119066717", "AffiliationName": "ClinSearch"}, "15765921400": {"Name": "Michelon H.", "AuthorID": "15765921400", "AffiliationID": "60073352, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacy department, H\u00f4pital Sainte-P\u00e9rine, Groupe Hospitalier Universitaire AP-HP.Paris-Saclay, Assistance Publique-H\u00f4pitaux de Paris (AP-HP)"}, "57193742036": {"Name": "Orlu M.", "AuthorID": "57193742036", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "6603352762": {"Name": "Jani Y.", "AuthorID": "6603352762", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medicines Optimisation Research and Education, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6602598552": {"Name": "Leglise P.", "AuthorID": "6602598552", "AffiliationID": "60021567", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacy department, H\u00f4pital Joffre Dupuytren, H\u00f4pitaux Universitaires Henri Mondor, Assistance Publique-H\u00f4pitaux de Paris (AP-HP)"}, "56183974300": {"Name": "Laribe-Caget S.", "AuthorID": "56183974300", "AffiliationID": "60031394, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacy department, H\u00f4pital Rothschild, H\u00f4pitaux Universitaires Est Parisien, Assistance Publique-H\u00f4pitaux de Paris (AP-HP)"}, "57195311766": {"Name": "Piccoli M.", "AuthorID": "57195311766", "AffiliationID": "60013112, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "H\u00f4pital Broca, H\u00f4pitaux Universitaires Paris Centre, Assistance Publique-H\u00f4pitaux de Paris (APHP)"}, "57203362872": {"Name": "Liu F.", "AuthorID": "57203362872", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Life and Medical Sciences, University of Hertfordshire"}, "6507329530": {"Name": "Boudy V.", "AuthorID": "6507329530", "AffiliationID": "60105728, 60008134, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "UTCBS, Chemical and Biological Technologies for Health Laboratory, CNRS, INSERM, Universit\u00e9 de Paris"}}}
