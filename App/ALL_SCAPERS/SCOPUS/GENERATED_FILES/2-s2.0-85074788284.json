{"Title": "Insights into the perception that research ethics committees are a barrier to research with seriously ill children: A study of committee minutes and correspondence with researchers studying seriously ill children", "Year": 2020, "Source": "Palliative Med.", "Volume": "34", "Issue": 3, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 413, "PageEnd": 423, "CitedBy": 1, "DOI": "10.1177/0269216319885566", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85074788284&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2019.Background: Research ethics committees are commonly perceived as a \u2018barrier\u2019 to research involving seriously ill children. Researchers studying seriously ill children often feel that committees view their applications more harshly compared to applications for research with other populations. Whether or not this is the case in practice is unknown. Aim: The aim of this study was to explore committees\u2019 concerns, expectations and decisions for research applications involving seriously ill children submitted for review in the United Kingdom. Design: Content analysis of committee meeting minutes, decision letters and researcher response letters. Setting/participants: Chief investigators for National Institute of Health Research portfolio studies involving seriously ill children were contacted for permission to review their study documents. Results: Of the 77 applications included in this study, 57 received requests for revisions at first review. Committee expectations and concerns commonly related to participant information sheets, methodology, consent, recruitment or formatting. Changes were made to 53 of these studies, all of which were subsequently approved. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that committees review applications for research involving seriously ill children with the same scrutiny as applications for research with other populations. Yet, the perception that committees act as a barrier to this type of research persists. We suggest that this perception remains due to other factors including, but not limited to, the high levels of formatting or administrative revisions requested by committees or additional study requirements needed for research involving children, such as multiple versions of consent forms or participant information sheets.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Child", "content analysis", "ethics committees", "research", "United Kingdom"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074788284", "SubjectAreas": [["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"56274310900": {"Name": "Butler A.E.", "AuthorID": "56274310900", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, The Louis Dundas Centre for Children\u2019s Palliative Care, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57211663682": {"Name": "Vincent K.", "AuthorID": "57211663682", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, The Louis Dundas Centre for Children\u2019s Palliative Care, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "6506146518": {"Name": "Bluebond-Langner M.", "AuthorID": "6506146518", "AffiliationID": "60119141", "AffiliationName": "Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey"}}}
