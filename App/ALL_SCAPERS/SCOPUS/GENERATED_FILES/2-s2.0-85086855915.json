Here, we achieved a high fluorescence anisotropy value of 0.4 in the mixed-anion lead halide perovskite NRs, which constitutes a four-fold enhancement as compared to pristine CsPbBr3 NRs. This was realized by substituting some smaller bromine anions with larger iodine anions in the orthorhombic CsPbBr3 NRs via anion exchange. The resulting CsPbBr1.2I1.8 NRs kept a highly uniform length of \u223c36 nm and width of \u223c8.6 nm, and possessed a high emission quantum yield of 83%. On the basis of the DFT calculations, we attribute the improved polarized emission of the mixed-anion perovskite NRs to a moderate structural distortion of PbX6 octahedra units in the orthorhombic perovskite lattice, which results in a preferred direction of the optical transition dipole moment along the Pb-X-Pb axis. Our study provides a guidance for design and fabrication of perovskite NRs with high fluorescence anisotropy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086855915", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"57201067329": {"Name": "Dudka T.", "AuthorID": "57201067329", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Centre for Functional Photonics (CFP), City University of Hong Kong"}, "7006264796": {"Name": "Rogach A.L.", "AuthorID": "7006264796", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Centre for Functional Photonics (CFP), City University of Hong Kong"}, "57211692783": {"Name": "Dou Y.", "AuthorID": "57211692783", "AffiliationID": "60023813, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Advanced Display and System Applications, Ministry of Education, Shanghai University"}, "55334763100": {"Name": "Cao F.", "AuthorID": "55334763100", "AffiliationID": "60023813, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Advanced Display and System Applications, Ministry of Education, Shanghai University"}, "57213678983": {"Name": "Wang S.", "AuthorID": "57213678983", "AffiliationID": "60023813, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Advanced Display and System Applications, Ministry of Education, Shanghai University"}, "57203013008": {"Name": "Zhang C.", "AuthorID": "57203013008", "AffiliationID": "60023813, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Advanced Display and System Applications, Ministry of Education, Shanghai University"}, "25959806200": {"Name": "Yang X.", "AuthorID": "25959806200", "AffiliationID": "60023813, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Advanced Display and System Applications, Ministry of Education, Shanghai University"}, "57205356000": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "57205356000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Faculty of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, University College London"}, "56167728300": {"Name": "Gao Y.", "AuthorID": "56167728300", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto"}}}
