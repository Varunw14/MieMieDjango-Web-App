Design: Retrospective, cohort study. Participants: Ninety eyes (of 67 patients) receiving intravitreal anti\u2013vascular endothelial growth factor therapy were included. Methods: This is a retrospective, real-life, cohort study. Each patient had visual acuity measurements and optical coherence tomography scans performed at baseline and 12 months after the first injection of aflibercept was given. Main Outcome Measures: We measured visual acuities in Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters, central foveal thickness and macular volume at baseline and at 12 months after the first aflibercept injection was given. Results: Ninety switched eyes were included in this study. The mean (standard deviation) visual acuity was 63 (15.78) Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters. At baseline, the mean (standard deviation) central foveal thickness was 417.7 (158.4) \u03bcm and the mean macular volume was 9.96 (2.44) mm3. Mean change in visual acuity was +4 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters (p = 0.0053). The mean change in macular volume was \u22121.53 mm 3 in SW group (p = 0.21), while the change in central foveal thickness was \u2212136.8 \u03bcm (p = 0.69). Conclusion: There was a significant improvement in visual acuity and in anatomical outcomes in the switched group at 12 months after commencing treatment with aflibercept for diabetic macular oedema.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anatomy/biochemistry/physiology", "cystoid macular oedema", "Diabetic macular oedema", "diabetic retinopathy", "diagnostic techniques", "glaucoma", "pharmacology", "retina"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085379820", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"57209482577": {"Name": "Lukic M.", "AuthorID": "57209482577", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57199257787": {"Name": "Williams G.", "AuthorID": "57199257787", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "24833529000": {"Name": "Shalchi Z.", "AuthorID": "24833529000", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7401717575": {"Name": "Patel P.J.", "AuthorID": "7401717575", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7003429874": {"Name": "Hykin P.G.", "AuthorID": "7003429874", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "35795310300": {"Name": "Hamilton R.D.", "AuthorID": "35795310300", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "8417872600": {"Name": "Rajendram R.", "AuthorID": "8417872600", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
