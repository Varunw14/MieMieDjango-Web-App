Exemplars are typological representatives that try to convey typicality in non-taxonomic terms, yet in the existing literature, they are defined in terms of their relationship to a population, class or sample. We suggest instead that \u2018dialogical exemplars\u2019, as specific instances that have the self-other at their core, can be used to convey the \u2018wholeness\u2019 of cases to various audiences. To support this proposition, we draw upon two single case studies, built 30 years apart, that are concerned with children\u2019s daily lives and experiences. Specifically, we develop a dialogue with and between examples from each case of children's play, not only to make the case for \u2018dialogical exemplars\u2019, but also to evidence the process through which we arrived at this concept. We highlight that this process is one that researchers often go through, but, rather curiously, rarely document. In conclusion, we suggest that \u2018resituating knowledge\u2019 might be best thought of as several, non-linear, stages in the process of dialogical research that involve, and invite further dialogue.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dialogical exemplars", "dialogicality", "generalisation", "resituating knowledge", "single case studies"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075387020", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"57052627600": {"Name": "Zadeh S.", "AuthorID": "57052627600", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Coram Research Unit, UCL Institute of Education"}, "57211944875": {"Name": "Cabra M.", "AuthorID": "57211944875", "AffiliationID": "60002128", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Neuch\u00e2tel"}}}
