However, geopolymers show quasi-brittle behavior. To overcome this weakness, hundreds of research have been focused on development, characterization, and implementation of fiber-reinforced geopolymers for a wide range of applications. This paper discusses the rapidly developing state-of-the-art of fiber-reinforced geopolymer composites, focusing on material and geometrical properties of construction fibers, and underlying mechanisms on fiber-binder interaction at fresh and hardened states, mechanical properties, toughening mechanisms, thermal characteristics, and environmental durability. It is intended to build a strong conceptual and technical background for what is currently understood on fiber-reinforced geopolymers by tying the subject together with knowns for other similar cementitious composites rather than a historical report of literature.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Durability", "Engineering properties", "Fiber", "Geopolymer", "Strain hardening", "Thermal properties"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cementitious composites", "Engineering properties", "Environmental durability", "Geopolymer", "Geopolymer composites", "Sustainable construction", "Thermal characteristics", "Toughening mechanisms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077185041", "SubjectAreas": [["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"55484588000": {"Name": "Ranjbar N.", "AuthorID": "55484588000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "24479149600": {"Name": "Zhang M.", "AuthorID": "24479149600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
