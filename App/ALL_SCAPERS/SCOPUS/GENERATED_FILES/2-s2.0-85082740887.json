All NCLs are lethal and incurable and only one has an approved treatment available. To date, 13 NCL subtypes (CLN1-8, CLN10-14) have been identified, based on the particular disease-causing defective gene. The exact functions of NCL proteins and the pathological mechanisms underlying the diseases are still unclear. However, gene therapy has emerged as an attractive therapeutic strategy for this group of conditions. Here we provide a short review discussing updates on the current gene therapy studies for the NCLs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Batten disease", "Clinical trials", "Gene therapy", "Neurodegeneration", "Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses", "Pre-clinical studies"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Genetic Therapy", "Humans", "Neuronal Ceroid-Lipofuscinoses"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082740887", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"57212495985": {"Name": "Liu W.", "AuthorID": "57212495985", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "55512744600": {"Name": "Herranz-Martin S.", "AuthorID": "55512744600", "AffiliationID": "60026796, 60018505", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Biolog\u00eda Molecular Severo Ochoa (UAM-CSIC) and Departamento de Biolog\u00eda Molecular, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid (UAM)"}, "14045774100": {"Name": "Rahim A.A.", "AuthorID": "14045774100", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57193721352": {"Name": "kleine-Holthaus S.M.", "AuthorID": "57193721352", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "54960978000": {"Name": "Aristorena M.", "AuthorID": "54960978000", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57203012241": {"Name": "Smith A.J.", "AuthorID": "57203012241", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "7201812544": {"Name": "Ali R.R.", "AuthorID": "7201812544", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005160390": {"Name": "Mole S.E.", "AuthorID": "7005160390", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}}}
