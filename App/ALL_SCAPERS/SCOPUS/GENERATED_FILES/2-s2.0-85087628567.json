Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The COVID-19 pandemic is rising at an unprecedented rate. The surging number of deaths every day, global lockdown and travel restrictions have resulted in huge losses to society. The impact is massive and will leave a historical footprint. The Spanish Flu of 1918, which was the last pandemic that had a similar impact, was shadowed under the consequences of World War I. All the brilliance, strength and economies of countries worldwide are aimed at fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. The knowledge about coronavirus dynamics, its nature and epidemiology are expanding every day. The present review aims to summarize the structure, epidemiology, symptoms, statistical status of the disease status, intervention strategies and deliberates the lessons learnt during the pandemic. The intervention approaches, antiviral drug repurposing and vaccine trials are intensified now. Statistical interpretations of disease dynamics and their projections may help the decision-makers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["COVID-19", "Pandemic", "SARS-CoV-2"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087628567", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"57189093485": {"Name": "Pandey S.", "AuthorID": "57189093485", "AffiliationID": "60025589", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, School of Chemical and Life Sciences"}, "57220539228": {"Name": "Yadav B.", "AuthorID": "57220539228", "AffiliationID": "124749460", "AffiliationName": "Microbial Pathogenesis and Microbiome Lab, Department of Microbiology, Central University of Ajmer"}, "57217827221": {"Name": "Khawary M.", "AuthorID": "57217827221", "AffiliationID": "124749460", "AffiliationName": "Microbial Pathogenesis and Microbiome Lab, Department of Microbiology, Central University of Ajmer"}, "52564615400": {"Name": "Tripathi D.", "AuthorID": "52564615400", "AffiliationID": "124749460", "AffiliationName": "Microbial Pathogenesis and Microbiome Lab, Department of Microbiology, Central University of Ajmer"}, "35183807700": {"Name": "Pandey A.", "AuthorID": "35183807700", "AffiliationID": "60107394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, Central University of Rajasthan"}, "57217832720": {"Name": "Tripathi T.", "AuthorID": "57217832720", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "57203233327": {"Name": "Kant S.", "AuthorID": "57203233327", "AffiliationID": "60028421, 60028392", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology and Microbiology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Anschutz Medical Campus"}}}
