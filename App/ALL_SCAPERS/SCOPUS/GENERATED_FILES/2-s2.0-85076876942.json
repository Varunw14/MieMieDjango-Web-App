While this framework has been highly influential, a critical shortcoming for its application in sustainability governance is that it currently fails to represent how impacts related to one of the planetary boundaries affect the status of other planetary boundaries. Here, we surveyed and provisionally quantified interactions between the Earth system processes represented by the planetary boundaries and investigated their consequences for sustainability governance. We identified a dense network of interactions between the planetary boundaries. The resulting cascades and feedbacks predominantly amplify human impacts on the Earth system and thereby shrink the safe operating space for future human impacts on the Earth system. Our results show that an integrated understanding of Earth system dynamics is critical to navigating towards a sustainable future.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Dense network", "Earth systems", "Environmental issues", "Human impact", "ITS applications"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076876942", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Food Science", "AGRI", "1106"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"], ["Nature and Landscape Conservation", "ENVI", "2309"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"36893082400": {"Name": "Lade S.J.", "AuthorID": "36893082400", "AffiliationID": "60028378", "AffiliationName": "Bolin Centre for Climate Research, Stockholm University"}, "7005295903": {"Name": "Steffen W.", "AuthorID": "7005295903", "AffiliationID": "60082291, 60008950", "AffiliationName": "Fenner School of Environment and Society, The Australian National University"}, "30867559100": {"Name": "Donges J.F.", "AuthorID": "30867559100", "AffiliationID": "60116832, 60025182", "AffiliationName": "Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Member of the Leibniz Association"}, "6603746245": {"Name": "Rockstr\u00f6m J.", "AuthorID": "6603746245", "AffiliationID": "60116832, 60025182", "AffiliationName": "Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Member of the Leibniz Association"}, "7102036739": {"Name": "de Vries W.", "AuthorID": "7102036739", "AffiliationID": "60004156", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Research, Wageningen University and Research"}, "55630395300": {"Name": "Carpenter S.R.", "AuthorID": "55630395300", "AffiliationID": "60032179", "AffiliationName": "Center for Limnology, University of Wisconsin"}, "6602972127": {"Name": "Gerten D.", "AuthorID": "6602972127", "AffiliationID": "60000762", "AffiliationName": "Geography Department, Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin"}, "7102907897": {"Name": "Hoff H.", "AuthorID": "7102907897", "AffiliationID": "60015157", "AffiliationName": "Stockholm Environment Institute"}, "22135322100": {"Name": "Newbold T.", "AuthorID": "22135322100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research, Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "7202201972": {"Name": "Richardson K.", "AuthorID": "7202201972", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Center for Macroecology, Evolution, and Climate, Globe Institute, University of Copenhagen"}}}
