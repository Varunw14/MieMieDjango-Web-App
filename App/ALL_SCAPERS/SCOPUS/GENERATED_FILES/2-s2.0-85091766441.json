In theory, e-shoppers\u2019 search space via the internet is less constrained by spatial attributes. As a result, spatial attributes may barely affect the distance and duration of trips resulting from e-shopping for intangible services. The present study used data from 714 valid face-to-face interviews in Beijing, China, to verify this hypothesis. The results showed that e-shoppers were likely to travel farther after purchasing intangible services online. The effect of spatial attributes on the distance of a single trip was largely attenuated due to online purchases of these services, and the effect on the duration was correspondingly weaker to a limited extent. Therefore, spatial interventions aiming to moderate travel distances and durations may not be as effective in the age of online shopping.", "AuthorKeywords": ["China", "Intangible services", "Online shopping", "Spatial attributes", "Travel distance", "Travel duration"], "IndexKeywords": ["Beijing , China", "E-shoppers", "Face-to-face interview", "Online shopping", "Search spaces", "Spatial attribute", "Travel distance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091766441", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"], ["Management Science and Operations Research", "DECI", "1803"]], "AuthorData": {"57146378600": {"Name": "Shi K.", "AuthorID": "57146378600", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, Ghent University"}, "54787558100": {"Name": "De Vos J.", "AuthorID": "54787558100", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Planning, University College London"}, "57219221491": {"Name": "Li E.", "AuthorID": "57219221491", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, Ghent University"}, "57202125292": {"Name": "Witlox F.", "AuthorID": "57202125292", "AffiliationID": "60021666", "AffiliationName": "College of Civil Aviation, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics"}, "55719919300": {"Name": "Yang Y.", "AuthorID": "55719919300", "AffiliationID": "60028265", "AffiliationName": "College of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Lanzhou University"}}}
