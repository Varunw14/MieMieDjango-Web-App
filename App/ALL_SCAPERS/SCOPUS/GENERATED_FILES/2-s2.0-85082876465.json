We present the curated skeletal remains of a nonhuman primate present with osteolytic lesions consistent with a pathological process. We evaluated the observed pathological changes via an extensive macroscopic analysis of the skeleton, coupled with radiographic images of the affected bones, and provide a differential diagnosis of the skeletal remains using relevant clinical and zoopalaeopathological data. Multiple osteolytic lesions of varying sizes, as well as periosteal new bone, were present on several elements. The lesions affected the skeleton bilaterally, asymmetrically and with no clear focus or pattern. The skeletal lesions were differentially diagnosed as the result of either a metastatic neoplastic disease or a chronic infection. This case provides a zoopalaeopathological example for the study of skeletal lesions in nonhuman primates in anthropological and archaeological collections, where contextual data may not be available.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Differential diagnosis", "Infection", "Metastatic", "Neoplasia", "Nonhuman primate", "Zoopalaeopathology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082876465", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Animal Science and Zoology", "AGRI", "1103"]], "AuthorData": {"57190486056": {"Name": "Siek T.", "AuthorID": "57190486056", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "57201737821": {"Name": "Hirst C.S.", "AuthorID": "57201737821", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Anthropology Department, University College London"}, "7006429404": {"Name": "Waldron T.", "AuthorID": "7006429404", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}}}
