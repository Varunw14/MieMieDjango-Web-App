Epilepsia published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of International League Against EpilepsyObjective: This retrospective, cross-sectional study evaluated the feasibility and potential benefits of incorporating deep-learning on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) into planning stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) implantation in pediatric patients with diagnostically complex drug-resistant epilepsy. This study aimed to assess the degree of colocalization between automated lesion detection and the seizure onset zone (SOZ) as assessed by sEEG. Methods: A neural network classifier was applied to cortical features from MRI data from three cohorts. (1) The network was trained and cross-validated using 34 patients with visible focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs). (2) Specificity was assessed in 20 pediatric healthy controls. (3) Feasibility of incorporation into sEEG implantation plans was evaluated in 34 sEEG patients. Coordinates of sEEG contacts were coregistered with classifier-predicted lesions. sEEG contacts in seizure onset and irritative tissue were identified by clinical neurophysiologists. A distance of <10 mm between SOZ contacts and classifier-predicted lesions was considered colocalization. Results: In patients with radiologically defined lesions, classifier sensitivity was 74% (25/34 lesions detected). No clusters were detected in the controls (specificity = 100%). Of the total 34 sEEG patients, 21 patients had a focal cortical SOZ, of whom eight were histopathologically confirmed as having an FCD. The algorithm correctly detected seven of eight of these FCDs (86%). In patients with histopathologically heterogeneous focal cortical lesions, there was colocalization between classifier output and SOZ contacts in 62%. In three patients, the electroclinical profile was indicative of focal epilepsy, but no SOZ was localized on sEEG. In these patients, the classifier identified additional abnormalities that had not been implanted. Significance: There was a high degree of colocalization between automated lesion detection and sEEG. We have created a framework for incorporation of deep-learning\u2013based MRI lesion detection into sEEG implantation planning. Our findings support the prospective evaluation of automated MRI analysis to plan optimal electrode trajectories.", "AuthorKeywords": ["deep learning", "epilepsy", "neuroimaging", "pediatric", "stereoelectroencephalography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cohort Studies", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Drug Resistant Epilepsy", "Electroencephalography", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Retrospective Studies", "Stereotaxic Techniques"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086345658", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56538706700": {"Name": "Wagstyl K.", "AuthorID": "56538706700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "57192888001": {"Name": "Adler S.", "AuthorID": "57192888001", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neurosciences, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "56648090300": {"Name": "Pimpel B.", "AuthorID": "56648090300", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neurosciences, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "55204436800": {"Name": "Chari A.", "AuthorID": "55204436800", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "24823693800": {"Name": "Seunarine K.", "AuthorID": "24823693800", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neurosciences, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "56318479900": {"Name": "Lorio S.", "AuthorID": "56318479900", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neurosciences, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "25640387400": {"Name": "Thornton R.", "AuthorID": "25640387400", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7003274699": {"Name": "Baldeweg T.", "AuthorID": "7003274699", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neurosciences, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "16242763100": {"Name": "Tisdall M.", "AuthorID": "16242763100", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital"}}}
