We developed a robust characterization methodology composed of quantitative bright-field absorbance microscopy (QBAM) and deep neural networks (DNNs) to noninvasively predict tissue function and cellular donor identity. The methodology was validated using clinical-grade induced pluripotent stem cell\u2013derived retinal pigment epithelial cells (iPSC-RPE). QBAM images of iPSC-RPE were used to train DNNs that predicted iPSC-RPE monolayer transepithelial resistance, predicted polarized vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion, and matched iPSC-RPE monolayers to the stem cell donors. DNN predictions were supplemented with traditional machine-learning algorithms that identified shape and texture features of single cells that were used to predict tissue function and iPSC donor identity. These results demonstrate noninvasive cell therapy characterization can be achieved with QBAM and machine learning.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cell Differentiation", "Deep Learning", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Microscopy", "Retinal Pigment Epithelium"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076416011", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"37162141700": {"Name": "Schaub N.J.", "AuthorID": "37162141700", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Michigan"}, "7401975348": {"Name": "Simon C.G.", "AuthorID": "7401975348", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Building 224"}, "56081684200": {"Name": "Hotaling N.A.", "AuthorID": "56081684200", "AffiliationID": "60007651, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Ocular and Stem Cell Translational Research Section, National Eye Institute, NIH"}, "35273772600": {"Name": "Wan Q.", "AuthorID": "35273772600", "AffiliationID": "60007651, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Ocular and Stem Cell Translational Research Section, National Eye Institute, NIH"}, "57209887316": {"Name": "Sharma R.", "AuthorID": "57209887316", "AffiliationID": "60007651, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Ocular and Stem Cell Translational Research Section, National Eye Institute, NIH"}, "57213445127": {"Name": "George A.", "AuthorID": "57213445127", "AffiliationID": "60007651, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Ocular and Stem Cell Translational Research Section, National Eye Institute, NIH"}, "9234772600": {"Name": "Bharti K.", "AuthorID": "9234772600", "AffiliationID": "60006577", "AffiliationName": "NIH Building 10, Room 10B10"}, "57217967740": {"Name": "Manescu P.", "AuthorID": "57217967740", "AffiliationID": "60023053", "AffiliationName": "Information Technology Laboratory, Information Systems Group, National Institute of Standards and Technology"}, "57191666907": {"Name": "Padi S.", "AuthorID": "57191666907", "AffiliationID": "60023053", "AffiliationName": "Information Technology Laboratory, Information Systems Group, National Institute of Standards and Technology"}, "22233252100": {"Name": "Chalfoun J.", "AuthorID": "22233252100", "AffiliationID": "60023053", "AffiliationName": "Information Technology Laboratory, Information Systems Group, National Institute of Standards and Technology"}, "56779380400": {"Name": "Simon M.", "AuthorID": "56779380400", "AffiliationID": "60023053", "AffiliationName": "Information Technology Laboratory, Information Systems Group, National Institute of Standards and Technology"}, "57214626949": {"Name": "Ouladi M.", "AuthorID": "57214626949", "AffiliationID": "60023053", "AffiliationName": "Information Technology Laboratory, Information Systems Group, National Institute of Standards and Technology"}, "6603030051": {"Name": "Bajcsy P.", "AuthorID": "6603030051", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Building 224"}}}
