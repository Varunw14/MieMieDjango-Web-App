We conducted an online survey of the CF community to gather data on current ACT use, recommendations, reported adherence levels and exercise strategies used. There were 488 respondents: 194 (40%) people with CF (pwCF), 141 (29%) family and 153 (31%) healthcare professionals (HCPs) (mostly physiotherapists). Only 10/285 (4%) of pwCF do no exercise at present and 163/303 (54%) already incorporate exercise into ACTs. ACTs were omitted by 128/267 (48%) of pwCF when they exercised. Nearly all (110/129, 93%) of HCPs currently recommend exercise to support ACTs. A trial replacing some or all ACTs with exercise, was supported by 80/110 (73%) of HCPs, with an additional 9/110 (8%) willing to consider in selected patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Airway clearance techniques", "Clinical trial", "Co-production", "Cystic fibrosis", "Exercise", "Priority setting"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075378597", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"16070579700": {"Name": "Rowbotham N.J.", "AuthorID": "16070579700", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60030816", "AffiliationName": "University of Nottingham, Evidence Based Child Health Group, Division of Child Health, Obstetrics & Gynaecology"}, "57199389435": {"Name": "Smith S.J.", "AuthorID": "57199389435", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60030816", "AffiliationName": "University of Nottingham, Evidence Based Child Health Group, Division of Child Health, Obstetrics & Gynaecology"}, "7103344712": {"Name": "Smyth A.R.", "AuthorID": "7103344712", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60030816", "AffiliationName": "University of Nottingham, Evidence Based Child Health Group, Division of Child Health, Obstetrics & Gynaecology"}, "57210242034": {"Name": "Davies G.", "AuthorID": "57210242034", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57211943919": {"Name": "Daniels T.", "AuthorID": "57211943919", "AffiliationID": "60170537", "AffiliationName": "York Hull Adult Cystic Fibrosis Centre, York Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57204026064": {"Name": "Elliott Z.C.", "AuthorID": "57204026064", "AffiliationID": "120499245", "AffiliationName": "Parent of Children with CF"}, "57204026374": {"Name": "Gathercole K.", "AuthorID": "57204026374", "AffiliationID": "123494164", "AffiliationName": "Person with CF"}, "56503984800": {"Name": "Rayner O.C.", "AuthorID": "56503984800", "AffiliationID": "123016070", "AffiliationName": "Person with CF"}}}
