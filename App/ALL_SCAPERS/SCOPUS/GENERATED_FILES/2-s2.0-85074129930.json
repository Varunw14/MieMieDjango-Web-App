Our aim was to assess whether the test accuracy of the MoCA can be improved with additional tailored screening items targeting these three domains. Methods: We included 196 patients admitted to an acute stroke unit at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square (QS), London. Participants completed the MoCA as well as a series of additional QS-screening items designed to assess speed of processing, non-verbal memory and executive functions. Performance on the MoCA and QS screening items was compared with performance on \u201cgold standard\u201d neuropsychological assessment. Results: In our sample, 22% of patients were classified as \u201ccognitively intact\u201d on the traditional MoCA alone (\u2265 25). However, when tested on the QS-screening items, 40% of these patients failed on speed of processing, 56% failed on non-verbal memory and 26% failed on executive functions. Compared with neuropsychological assessment, the QS-screening items had good sensitivity (QS-Speed: 0.85; QS-Vis: 0.71; QS-EF: 0.73) and modest specificity (QS-Speed: 0.59; QS-Vis: 0.39; QS-EF: 0.54), regardless of stroke lateralisation. Conclusion: Additional screening items detected impairments in speed of processing, non-verbal memory and executive functions over and above those captured using the standard MoCA. The use of these QS-screening items improves the detection of post-stroke cognitive deficits in domains not adequately covered by the standard MoCA.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cognition", "Executive functions", "Neuropsychology", "Sensitivity", "Specificity", "Stroke"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Cognition", "Cognition Disorders", "Executive Function", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Status and Dementia Tests", "Middle Aged", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Stroke"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074129930", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56173866400": {"Name": "Chan E.", "AuthorID": "56173866400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, Stroke Research Centre"}, "57192660951": {"Name": "Altendorff S.", "AuthorID": "57192660951", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Dept. of Neuropsychology"}, "7004532494": {"Name": "Cipolotti L.", "AuthorID": "7004532494", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, Stroke Research Centre"}, "57211492004": {"Name": "Garritsen E.", "AuthorID": "57211492004", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, Stroke Research Centre"}, "6603142203": {"Name": "Simister R.", "AuthorID": "6603142203", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Comprehensive Stroke Service, University College London Hospital"}, "6603707621": {"Name": "Werring D.J.", "AuthorID": "6603707621", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Comprehensive Stroke Service, University College London Hospital"}, "57198448572": {"Name": "Turner D.", "AuthorID": "57198448572", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Comprehensive Stroke Service, University College London Hospital"}}}
