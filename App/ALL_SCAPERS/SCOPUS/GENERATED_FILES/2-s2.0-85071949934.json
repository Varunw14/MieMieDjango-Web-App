With 629 delegates from 37 countries (24 African), this was the largest forum of healthcare professionals focused on children and young people with cancer in Africa to showcase advances and discuss further improvements. Three targeted workshops, on nursing care, pharmacy and nutrition, attracted large numbers and catalysed new collaborative initiatives in supportive care studies, extended roles for pharmacists in quality control and care delivery and addressed malnutrition concurrently with cancer treatment. The Collaborative Wilms Tumour Africa Project, open in seven sub-Saharan countries, and the trials in Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma reported encouraging outcomes with further initiatives in supportive care (the supportive care for children with cancer in Africa project). While acknowledging deficits in radiotherapy provision, available in only 23 of 52 African countries, centres with facilities reported their technical advances that benefit patients. Of great importance for children with brain tumours, who are underdiagnosed in Africa, was the first announcement of African paediatric neuro-oncology society, whose 63 current members aim to tackle the shortage of neurosurgeons through training fellowships, workshops and a dedicated conference. The congress provided the opportunity to discuss how African countries will work with the WHO global initiative aiming to improve childhood cancer survival to 60% in all countries by 2030. This conference report is dedicated to the three Kenyan delegates who died tragically on the Ethiopian Airlines flight ET302 on their way home, full of new ideas and pride in what they had achieved so far. All those who heard their presentations are determined to continue their excellent work to improve cancer care for children in Africa.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Childhood cancer", "Clinical pharmacy", "Nutritional assessment", "Paediatric cancer nursing", "Paediatric neurosurgery"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071949934", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"56609207700": {"Name": "Khalek E.R.", "AuthorID": "56609207700", "AffiliationID": "60003593, 60113915", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Children\u2019s Cancer Hospital Egypt 57357"}, "57189732752": {"Name": "Afungchwi G.M.", "AuthorID": "57189732752", "AffiliationID": "60001565", "AffiliationName": "Cameroon Baptist Convention Health Services Childhood Cancer Programme, Cameroon University of Stellenbosch"}, "55929826000": {"Name": "Beltagy M.E.", "AuthorID": "55929826000", "AffiliationID": "60024697, 60010294, 60113915", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Children\u2019s Cancer Hospital Egypt 57357"}, "57210928059": {"Name": "Mariam N.", "AuthorID": "57210928059", "AffiliationID": "60071705", "AffiliationName": "Nursing officer, Uganda Cancer Institute"}, "57210935701": {"Name": "Zaki H.", "AuthorID": "57210935701", "AffiliationID": "60029258", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Nursing, Helwan University, Modern University for Technology and Information (MTI)"}, "24833084000": {"Name": "Israels T.", "AuthorID": "24833084000", "AffiliationID": "120828719", "AffiliationName": "Princess M\u00e0xima Center for Pediatric Oncology"}, "7004716450": {"Name": "Molyneux E.", "AuthorID": "7004716450", "AffiliationID": "60072679, 60072664", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Department, College of Medicine, Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital"}, "7202813210": {"Name": "Howard S.C.", "AuthorID": "7202813210", "AffiliationID": "60002194", "AffiliationName": "University of Tennessee Health Science Center"}, "7004573803": {"Name": "Patte C.", "AuthorID": "7004573803", "AffiliationID": "60027386", "AffiliationName": "CLCC G Groupe Franco-Africain d\u2019Oncologie P\u00e9diatrique (GFAOP), Institut Gustave Roussy, France and GFAOP"}, "57215464068": {"Name": "Schoeman J.", "AuthorID": "57215464068", "AffiliationID": "60001565", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, Stellenbosch University"}, "57203000053": {"Name": "Ladas E.", "AuthorID": "57203000053", "AffiliationID": "60027565", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Integrative Medicine, Integrative Therapies Program, Columbia University Medical Center"}, "7005397003": {"Name": "Zaghloul M.S.", "AuthorID": "7005397003", "AffiliationID": "60113915, 60015151", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Children\u2019s Cancer Hospital Egypt"}, "57210934309": {"Name": "ElDeen Y.S.", "AuthorID": "57210934309", "AffiliationID": "60033041", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Surgery, Alexandria University"}, "57198883724": {"Name": "Ahmed S.", "AuthorID": "57198883724", "AffiliationID": "60107271, 60113915", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Oncology Department, Aswan University, Children\u2019s Cancer Hospital Egypt"}, "55321243200": {"Name": "Kamal S.", "AuthorID": "55321243200", "AffiliationID": "60113915", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical Services, Children\u2019s Cancer Hospital Egypt"}, "57203082668": {"Name": "Bouffet E.", "AuthorID": "57203082668", "AffiliationID": "100734292", "AffiliationName": "International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP), Department of Neuro-oncology, Sick Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "7005535741": {"Name": "Pritchard-Jones K.", "AuthorID": "7005535741", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "55657000400": {"Name": "Hessissen L.", "AuthorID": "55657000400", "AffiliationID": "60019337", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Haematology and Oncology Center, University Mohamed V Rabat"}}}
