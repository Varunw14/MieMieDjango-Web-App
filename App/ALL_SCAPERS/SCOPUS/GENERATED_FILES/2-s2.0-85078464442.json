Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the University of Manchester. All rights reserved.Although the contents of the seventh-century bce letter found on ostraca fragments at Mesad Hashavyahu are relatively well understood, the proposed interpretation of one word has been too quickly accepted and should be challenged. This is the interpretation of , in line 14, as a form of , which is said to mean 'be silent'. The association with is not a foregone conclusion, however, and a survey of the biblical corpus demonstrates that a connection between II- and II- roots is exceptional rather than the norm. Furthermore, the existence of the root is itself uncertain, and the claim that it means 'be silent' is questionable rather than established. Finally, the only biblical use of the root , in Jer. 14:9, seems to have similar connotations and should be used to help interpret in the letter.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078464442", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Religious Studies", "ARTS", "1212"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Literature and Literary Theory", "ARTS", "1208"]], "AuthorData": {"57190758286": {"Name": "Noll S.", "AuthorID": "57190758286", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford"}}}
