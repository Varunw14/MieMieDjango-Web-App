We demonstrate this effect for a one-dimensional quantum circuit evolving under random unitary transformations and generic positive operator-valued measurements of variable strength. As opposed to projective measurements describing a restricted class of open systems, the measuring device is modeled as a continuous Gaussian probe, capturing a large class of environments. By employing data collapse and studying the enhanced fluctuations at the transition, we obtain a consistent phase boundary in the space of the measurement strength and the measurement probability, clearly demonstrating a critical value of the measurement strength below which the system is always ergodic, irrespective of the measurement probability. These findings provide guidance for quantum engineering of many-body systems by controlling their environment.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Entanglement transition", "Positive-operator-valued measurements", "Projective measurement", "Provide guidances", "Quantum engineering", "Quantum phase transitions", "Unitary transformations", "Weak measurements"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072037193", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"55341206900": {"Name": "Szyniszewski M.", "AuthorID": "55341206900", "AffiliationID": "60023643", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Lancaster University"}, "23006097100": {"Name": "Romito A.", "AuthorID": "23006097100", "AffiliationID": "60023643", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Lancaster University"}, "57196831306": {"Name": "Schomerus H.", "AuthorID": "57196831306", "AffiliationID": "60023643", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Lancaster University"}}}
