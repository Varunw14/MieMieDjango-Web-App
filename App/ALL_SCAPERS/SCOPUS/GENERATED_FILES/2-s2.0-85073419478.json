The move toward community energy schemes, where prosumers can trade their surplus electricity locally, and the implications this has for tariff design motivates our study. We propose a portfolio of stylized retail tariffs for different market organizations. Among the proposed configurations are time-of-use (ToU), default vertical and peer-to-peer (P2P) tariffs, the last of which operates through a blockchain platform. In this study, each Singaporean district is balanced as a potential future microgrid. An iterative double-auction mechanism is designed to calculate a distributed P2P tariff, looking to maximize the benefit for stakeholders. This tariff is then cleared and compared with a bespoke retail ToU tariff as well as Singapore\u2019s monopolistic regulated vertical tariff.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Auctions", "Peer-to-peer (P2P)", "Prosumers", "Retail", "Tariffs", "Time-of-use (ToU)"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073419478", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"]], "AuthorData": {"57190516605": {"Name": "Nieto-Martin J.", "AuthorID": "57190516605", "AffiliationID": "60010057", "AffiliationName": "London Business School"}, "57211320982": {"Name": "Blaise A.", "AuthorID": "57211320982", "AffiliationID": "60004407", "AffiliationName": "Complex Systems Research Centre, Cranfield University"}, "15081806200": {"Name": "Varga L.", "AuthorID": "15081806200", "AffiliationID": "60004407", "AffiliationName": "Complex Systems Research Centre, Cranfield University"}}}
