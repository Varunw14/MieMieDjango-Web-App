KGaA, WeinheimThe total synthesis of representative members of the schizozygine alkaloids, (+)-vallesamidine and (+)-14,15-dehydrostrempeliopine, were completed from a late-stage divergent intermediate. The synthesis took advantage of efficient nitro-group reactions with the A/B/C ring skeleton constructed concisely on a gram scale through an asymmetric Michael addition, nitro-Mannich/lactamisation, Tsuji\u2013Trost allylation, and intramolecular C\u2212N coupling reaction. Other key features of the synthesis are a novel [1,4] hydride transfer/Mannich-type cyclisation to build ring E and a diastereoselective ring-closing metathesis reaction to construct ring D. This approach gave access to a late-stage C14,C15 alkene divergent intermediate that could be simply transformed into (+)-vallesamidine, (+)-14,15-dehydrostrempeliopine, and potentially other schizozygine alkaloids and unnatural derivatives.", "AuthorKeywords": ["alkaloids", "asymmetric synthesis", "hydride transfer/cyclization", "nitro-Mannich reaction", "total synthesis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Asymmetric synthesis", "Coupling reaction", "Diastereoselective", "Hydride transfers", "Michael additions", "Nitro-Mannich reaction", "Ring-closing metathesis reactions", "Total synthesis", "Alkaloids", "Cyclization", "Indole Alkaloids", "Molecular Structure", "Stereoisomerism"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074727366", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"57211639452": {"Name": "Zhang X.", "AuthorID": "57211639452", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55553734284": {"Name": "Anderson J.C.", "AuthorID": "55553734284", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
