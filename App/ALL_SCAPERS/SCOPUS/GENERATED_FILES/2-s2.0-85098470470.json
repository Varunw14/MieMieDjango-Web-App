This led to damage to auditory cortex including planum temporale that spared medial Heschl's gyrus, and included damage to the posterior insula and inferior parietal lobule. She reported chronic difficulties with segregating speech from noise and segregating elements of music. Clinical tests showed no evidence for abnormal cochlear function. Follow-up tests confirmed difficulties with auditory segregation in her left ear that spanned multiple domains, including words-in-noise and music streaming. Testing with a stochastic figure-ground task\u2014a way of estimating generic acoustic foreground and background segregation\u2014demonstrated that this was also abnormal. This is the first demonstration of an acquired deficit in the segregation of complex acoustic patterns due to cortical damage, which we argue is a causal explanation for the symptomatic deficits in the segregation of speech and music. These symptoms are analogous to the visual symptom of simultaneous agnosia. Consistent with functional imaging studies on normal listeners, the work implicates non-primary auditory cortex. Further, the work demonstrates a (partial) lateralisation of the necessary anatomical substrate for segregation that has not been previously highlighted.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Audition", "Misophonia", "Music", "Segregation", "Speech perception"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85098470470", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"57189340121": {"Name": "Holmes E.", "AuthorID": "57189340121", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL"}, "7102183421": {"Name": "Griffiths T.D.", "AuthorID": "7102183421", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Biosciences Institute, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Newcastle University"}, "57210460137": {"Name": "Utoomprurkporn N.", "AuthorID": "57210460137", "AffiliationID": "60028190, 60022183", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital"}, "6701719104": {"Name": "Bamiou D.E.", "AuthorID": "6701719104", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, UCL"}, "57192278679": {"Name": "Hoskote C.", "AuthorID": "57192278679", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lysholm Department of Neuroradiology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, UCL"}, "57210539622": {"Name": "Warren J.D.", "AuthorID": "57210539622", "AffiliationID": "100569211", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre"}}}
