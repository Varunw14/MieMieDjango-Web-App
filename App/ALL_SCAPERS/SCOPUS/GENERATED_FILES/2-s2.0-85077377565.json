This article explored the predictive validity of one gender-neutral risk assessment tool\u2014the Dynamic Risk Assessment for Offender Re-Entry (DRAOR)\u2014with matched samples of women and men serving community supervision sentences. Total DRAOR scores had comparative predictive validity across gender. For women and men, the DRAOR predicted reconviction over a static risk measure. The findings support the general premise of gender neutrality, but do not necessarily suggest the DRAOR, or gender-neutral tools more broadly, are the best tools for use with women.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DRAOR", "gender", "recidivism", "risk assessment", "women"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077377565", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"57072938300": {"Name": "Scanlan J.", "AuthorID": "57072938300", "AffiliationID": "60002316", "AffiliationName": "Victoria University of Wellington"}, "54893765200": {"Name": "Yesberg J.", "AuthorID": "54893765200", "AffiliationID": "60002316", "AffiliationName": "Victoria University of Wellington"}, "15765127400": {"Name": "Fortune C.", "AuthorID": "15765127400", "AffiliationID": "60002316", "AffiliationName": "Victoria University of Wellington"}, "6603529993": {"Name": "Polaschek D.", "AuthorID": "6603529993", "AffiliationID": "60002316", "AffiliationName": "Victoria University of Wellington"}}}
