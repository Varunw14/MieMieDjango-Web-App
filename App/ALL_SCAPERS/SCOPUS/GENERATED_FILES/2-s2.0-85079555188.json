Complementing immune-histological diagnosis with current ancillary diagnostic techniques, including FISH and RT-PCR, can lead to inconclusive results in a significant number of cases. We describe here the design and validation of a novel sequencing tool to improve sarcoma diagnosis. A NGS DNA capture panel containing probes for 87 fusion genes and 7 genes with frequent copy number changes was designed and optimized. A cohort of 113 DNA samples extracted from soft-tissue and bone sarcoma FFPE material with clinical FISH and/or RT-PCR results positive for either a translocation or gene amplification was used for validation of the NGS method. Sarcoma-specific translocations or gene amplifications were confirmed in 110 out of 113 cases using FISH and/or RT-PCR as gold-standard. MDM2/CDK4 amplification and a total of 25 distinct fusion genes were identified in this cohort of patients using the NGS approach. Overall, the sensitivity of the NGS panel is 97% with a specificity of 100 and 0% failure rate. Targeted NGS appears to be a feasible and cost-effective approach to improve sarcoma subtype diagnosis with the ability to screen for a wide range of genetic aberrations in one test.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079555188", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"]], "AuthorData": {"57220356283": {"Name": "McConnell L.", "AuthorID": "57220356283", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "CCRCB, Queen\u2019s University Belfast"}, "57209576462": {"Name": "Stewart P.", "AuthorID": "57209576462", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "CCRCB, Queen\u2019s University Belfast"}, "35329371900": {"Name": "Gazdova J.", "AuthorID": "35329371900", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "CCRCB, Queen\u2019s University Belfast"}, "57214933727": {"Name": "Srivastava S.", "AuthorID": "57214933727", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "CCRCB, Queen\u2019s University Belfast"}, "57214933319": {"Name": "Kim C.", "AuthorID": "57214933319", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "CCRCB, Queen\u2019s University Belfast"}, "7003434917": {"Name": "Salto-Tellez M.", "AuthorID": "7003434917", "AffiliationID": "60030456", "AffiliationName": "Belfast Health & Social Care Trust"}, "57217708645": {"Name": "Gonzalez D.", "AuthorID": "57217708645", "AffiliationID": "60030456", "AffiliationName": "Belfast Health & Social Care Trust"}, "12138798700": {"Name": "Houghton O.", "AuthorID": "12138798700", "AffiliationID": "60030456", "AffiliationName": "Belfast Health & Social Care Trust"}, "56020956700": {"Name": "Catherwood M.", "AuthorID": "56020956700", "AffiliationID": "60030456", "AffiliationName": "Belfast Health & Social Care Trust"}, "55965786000": {"Name": "Strobl A.", "AuthorID": "55965786000", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute"}, "7006896813": {"Name": "Flanagan A.M.", "AuthorID": "7006896813", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute"}, "7801329846": {"Name": "Oniscu A.", "AuthorID": "7801329846", "AffiliationID": "60002975", "AffiliationName": "Pathology Department at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"}, "54953310100": {"Name": "Kroeze L.I.", "AuthorID": "54953310100", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "7006290744": {"Name": "Groenen P.", "AuthorID": "7006290744", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "6603758254": {"Name": "Taniere P.", "AuthorID": "6603758254", "AffiliationID": "60012191", "AffiliationName": "Pathology Department at Queen\u2019s Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham"}}}
