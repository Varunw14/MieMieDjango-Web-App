We investigate cough duration as a proxy measure of transmission to assess the presence of potential TB superspreaders. DESIGN: We analyzed six studies from China, Peru, The Gambia and Uganda, and determined the distribution of cough duration and compared it with several theoretical distributions. To determine factors associated with cough duration, we used linear regression and boosted regression trees to examine the predictive power of patient, clinical and environmental characteristics. RESULTS: We found within-study heterogeneity in cough duration and strong similarities across studies. Approximately 20% of patients contributed 50% of total cough days, and around 50% of patients contributed 80% of total cough days. The cough duration distribution suggested an initially increasing, and subsequently, decreasing hazard of diagnosis. While some of the exposure variables showed statistically significant associations with cough duration, none of them had a strong effect. Multivariate analyses of different model types did not produce a model that had good predictive power. CONCLUSION: We found consistent evidence for the presence of supercoughers, but no characteristics predictive of such individuals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cough duration", "Superspreading", "TB"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "China", "Cohort Studies", "Cough", "Female", "Gambia", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Peru", "Tuberculosis, Pulmonary", "Uganda", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077316021", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"15047983400": {"Name": "Handel A.", "AuthorID": "15047983400", "AffiliationID": "60029747", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Health Informatics Institute, Center for the Ecology of Infectious Diseases, University of Georgia"}, "56454763100": {"Name": "Martinez L.", "AuthorID": "56454763100", "AffiliationID": "60029747", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Health Informatics Institute, Center for the Ecology of Infectious Diseases, University of Georgia"}, "26433870500": {"Name": "Sekandi J.N.", "AuthorID": "26433870500", "AffiliationID": "60029747", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Health Informatics Institute, Center for the Ecology of Infectious Diseases, University of Georgia"}, "36459684100": {"Name": "Bellan S.E.", "AuthorID": "36459684100", "AffiliationID": "60029747", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Health Informatics Institute, Center for the Ecology of Infectious Diseases, University of Georgia"}, "7004888185": {"Name": "Whalen C.C.", "AuthorID": "7004888185", "AffiliationID": "60029747", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Health Informatics Institute, Center for the Ecology of Infectious Diseases, University of Georgia"}, "55959599200": {"Name": "Zhu L.", "AuthorID": "55959599200", "AffiliationID": "60089925", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chronic Communicable Disease, Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Jiangsu Province"}, "54904241900": {"Name": "Chen C.", "AuthorID": "54904241900", "AffiliationID": "60089925", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chronic Communicable Disease, Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Jiangsu Province"}, "55959393200": {"Name": "Liu Q.", "AuthorID": "55959393200", "AffiliationID": "60089925", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chronic Communicable Disease, Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Jiangsu Province"}, "6507805228": {"Name": "Donkor S.", "AuthorID": "6507805228", "AffiliationID": "60031331, 60072002", "AffiliationName": "Vaccines and Immunity, Medical Research Council Unit The Gambia, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57209139389": {"Name": "Sutherland J.", "AuthorID": "57209139389", "AffiliationID": "60031331, 60072002", "AffiliationName": "Vaccines and Immunity, Medical Research Council Unit The Gambia, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "12779383000": {"Name": "Hill P.C.", "AuthorID": "12779383000", "AffiliationID": "60017311", "AffiliationName": "Centre for International Health, School of Medicine, University of Otago"}, "57202677769": {"Name": "Gilman R.H.", "AuthorID": "57202677769", "AffiliationID": "60006183", "AffiliationName": "Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Department of International Health"}, "24512250000": {"Name": "Grandjean L.", "AuthorID": "24512250000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
