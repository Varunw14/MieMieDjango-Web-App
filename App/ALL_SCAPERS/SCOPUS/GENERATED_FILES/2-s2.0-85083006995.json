Some reports suggested different impairments in the offspring of mothers with autoimmune diseases (AI) exposed in utero to AZA. These observations are available from retrospective studies or case reports. However, data with respect to the long-term safety in the antenatally exposed child are still lacking. The aim of this study is to summarize the current knowledge in this field and to focus on the need for a prospective study on this population. We performed a PubMed search using several search terms. The actual data show that although the risk of congenital anomalies in offspring, as well as the infertility risk, are similar to those found in general population, there is a higher incidence of prematurity, of lower weight at birth and an intra-uterine delay of development. There is also an increased risk of materno- fetal infections, especially cytomegalovirus infection. Some authors raise the interrogations about neurocognitive impairment. Even though the adverse outcomes might well be a consequence of maternal illness and disease activity, interest has been raised about a contribution of this drug. However, the interferences between the external agent (in utero exposure to AZA), with the host (child genetic susceptibility, immune system anomalies, emotional status), environment (public health, social context, availability of health care), economic, social, and behavioral conditions, cultural patterns, are complex and represent confounding factors. In conclusion, it is necessary to perform studies on the medium and long-term outcome of children born by mothers with autoimmune diseases, treated with AZA, in order to show the safety of AZA exposure. Only large-scale population studies with long-term follow-up will allow to formally conclude in this field. Take home messages: \u2022 There is no study on a significant number of subjects concerning the medium and long-term outcome of children born by mothers with autoimmune disease treated with AZA. \u2022 As AZA use is related to underlying disease and disease activity and many confounders interfere with AZA treatment, there is a major difficulty to distinguish between the influence of the disease itself on the risk of adverse birth outcome and potential AZA effects in offspring at medium and long term. \u2022 Data need to be implemented with large, multicenter studies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Autoimmune Diseases", "Azathioprine", "Child", "Female", "Humans", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications", "Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects", "Retrospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083006995", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"8707603600": {"Name": "Belizna C.", "AuthorID": "8707603600", "AffiliationID": "60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM U1083"}, "6602800235": {"Name": "Fassot C.", "AuthorID": "6602800235", "AffiliationID": "101526173", "AffiliationName": "Internal Medicine Department, Clinique de l'Anjou"}, "7006323647": {"Name": "Henrion D.", "AuthorID": "7006323647", "AffiliationID": "101526173", "AffiliationName": "Internal Medicine Department, Clinique de l'Anjou"}, "6602210726": {"Name": "Loufrani L.", "AuthorID": "6602210726", "AffiliationID": "101526173", "AffiliationName": "Internal Medicine Department, Clinique de l'Anjou"}, "6602950252": {"Name": "Guihot A.L.", "AuthorID": "6602950252", "AffiliationID": "101526173", "AffiliationName": "Internal Medicine Department, Clinique de l'Anjou"}, "57194727654": {"Name": "Meroni P.L.", "AuthorID": "57194727654", "AffiliationID": "60006646", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology Research Department Auxologico Institute"}, "57193196812": {"Name": "Chighizola C.", "AuthorID": "57193196812", "AffiliationID": "60006646", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology Research Department Auxologico Institute"}, "23111571000": {"Name": "Pregnolato F.", "AuthorID": "23111571000", "AffiliationID": "60006646", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology Research Department Auxologico Institute"}, "7006577325": {"Name": "Borghi M.O.", "AuthorID": "7006577325", "AffiliationID": "60006646", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology Research Department Auxologico Institute"}, "36879964800": {"Name": "Shoenfeld Y.", "AuthorID": "36879964800", "AffiliationID": "60010188", "AffiliationName": "I.M.
