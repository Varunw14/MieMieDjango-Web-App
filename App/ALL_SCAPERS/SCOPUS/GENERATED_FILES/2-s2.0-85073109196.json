This work aims at the incorporation of the GE SIGNA PET/MR scanner in STIR and enables PET image reconstruction with data corrections. The data extracted from the scanner after an acquisition includes a list of raw data files (emission, normalisation, geometric and well counter calibration (wcc) factors), magnetic resonance attenuation correction (MRAC) images and the scanner-based reconstructions. The listmode (LM) file stores a list of 'prompt' events and the singles per crystal per second. MRAC images from the scanner are used for attenuation correction. The modifications to STIR that allow accurate histogramming of this LM data in the same sinogram organisation as the scanner are also described. This allows reconstruction of acquisition data with all data corrections using STIR, and independent of any software supplied by the manufacturer. The implementations were validated by comparing the histogrammed data, data corrections and final reconstruction using the ordered subset expectation maximisation (OSEM) algorithm with the equivalents from the GE-toolbox, supplied by the manufacturer for the scanner. There is no difference in the histogrammed counts whereas an overall relative difference of 6.7 \u00d7 10-8% and from 0.01% to 0.86% is seen in the normalisation and randoms correction sinograms respectively. The STIR reconstructed images have similar resolution and quantification but have some residual differences due to wcc factors, decay and deadtime corrections, as well as the offset between PET and MR gantries that will be addressed in future work. This work will enable the use of all current and future STIR algorithms, including penalized image reconstruction, motion correction and direct parametric image estimation, on data from GE SIGNA PET/MR scanners.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Attenuation correction", "Dead-time correction", "Emission tomography", "Expectation-maximisation", "PET image reconstruction", "Reconstructed image", "Resonance attenuation", "Software for tomographic image reconstruction"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073109196", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"]], "AuthorData": {"57204893983": {"Name": "Wadhwa P.", "AuthorID": "57204893983", "AffiliationID": "121081554", "AffiliationName": "Invicro"}, "7202566385": {"Name": "Buckley D.", "AuthorID": "7202566385", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Imaging Science, University of Leeds"}, "23480821300": {"Name": "Tsoumpas C.", "AuthorID": "23480821300", "AffiliationID": "121081554", "AffiliationName": "Invicro"}, "7003295371": {"Name": "Hallett W.", "AuthorID": "7003295371", "AffiliationID": "121081554", "AffiliationName": "Invicro"}, "7101894687": {"Name": "Gunn R.N.", "AuthorID": "7101894687", "AffiliationID": "121081554", "AffiliationName": "Invicro"}, "23480655200": {"Name": "Thielemans K.", "AuthorID": "23480655200", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "57076776500": {"Name": "Bertolli O.", "AuthorID": "57076776500", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "57205073110": {"Name": "Emond E.", "AuthorID": "57205073110", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "36971045500": {"Name": "Thomas B.A.", "AuthorID": "36971045500", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "15821657900": {"Name": "Efthimiou N.", "AuthorID": "15821657900", "AffiliationID": "60030469", "AffiliationName": "PET Research Centre, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Hull"}, "6507933908": {"Name": "Tohme M.", "AuthorID": "6507933908", "AffiliationID": "60106890", "AffiliationName": "GE Healthcare"}, "23478633600": {"Name": "Wangerin K.A.", "AuthorID": "23478633600", "AffiliationID": "60106890", "AffiliationName": "GE Healthcare"}, "14022727600": {"Name": "Delso G.", "AuthorID": "14022727600", "AffiliationID": "60106637", "AffiliationName": "GE Healthcare"}}}
