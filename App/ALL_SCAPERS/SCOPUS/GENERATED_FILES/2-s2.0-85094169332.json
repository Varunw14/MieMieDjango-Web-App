We have recently reported on a phase II, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial comparing postnatal rhIGF-1/rhIGFBP-3 replacement with standard of care (SOC) in extremely preterm infants (NCT01096784). Maximum severity of retinopathy of prematurity was the primary endpoint of the trial and presence of GMH-IVH/PHI one of the pre-specified secondary endpoints. Infants therefore received serial cranial ultrasound scans (CUS) between birth and term age. In this post-hoc analysis we present a detailed analysis of the CUS data of this trial and evaluate the effect of postnatal rhIGF-1/rhIGFBP-3 replacement on the incidence of different kinds of brain injury in extremely preterm infants. Methods: This report is an exploratory post-hoc analysis of a phase II trial in which infants <28 weeks gestational age were randomly allocated to rhIGF-1/rhIGFBP-3 or SOC. Serial cranial ultrasounds were performed between birth and term-equivalent age. Presence of germinal matrix hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage (GMH-IVH), periventricular hemorrhagic infarction (PHI), post-hemorrhagic ventricular dilatation, and white matter injury (WMI) were scored by two independent masked readers. Results: The analysis included 117 infants; 58 received rhIGF-1/rhIGFBP-3 and 59 received SOC. A trend toward less grade II\u2013III GMH-IVH and PHI was observed in treated infants vs. SOC. A subanalysis of infants without evidence of GMH-IVH at study entry (n = 104) showed reduced progression to GMH-IVH in treated infants (25.0% [13/52] vs. 40.4% [21/52]; not significant). No effects of rhIGF-1/rhIGFBP-3 on WMI were observed. Conclusion: The potential protective effect of rhIGF-1/rhIGFBP-3 on the occurrence of GMH-IVH/PHI appeared most pronounced in infants with no evidence of GMH-IVH at treatment start.", "AuthorKeywords": ["brain injury", "cerebral hemorrhage", "extremely preterm", "neonate", "recombinant human IGF-1"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094169332", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"55826391400": {"Name": "Horsch S.", "AuthorID": "55826391400", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Science, Intervention and Technology (CLINTEC), Karolinska Institutet"}, "56247650300": {"Name": "Hallberg B.", "AuthorID": "56247650300", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Science, Intervention and Technology (CLINTEC), Karolinska Institutet"}, "56967659500": {"Name": "Parodi A.", "AuthorID": "56967659500", "AffiliationID": "60016041, 60107402", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Department Mother and Child, IRCCS (Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico) Istituto Giannina Gaslini"}, "56659352400": {"Name": "Malova M.", "AuthorID": "56659352400", "AffiliationID": "60016041, 60107402", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Department Mother and Child, IRCCS (Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico) Istituto Giannina Gaslini"}, "7004261136": {"Name": "Ramenghi L.A.", "AuthorID": "7004261136", "AffiliationID": "60025153", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences, Rehabilitation, Ophthalmology, Genetics, Maternal and Child Health (DINOGMI), University of Genoa"}, "6505820266": {"Name": "Bj\u00f6rkman-Burtscher I.M.", "AuthorID": "6505820266", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Sciences, Radiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg University"}, "6504571661": {"Name": "Hansen-Pupp I.", "AuthorID": "6504571661", "AffiliationID": "60014077, 60029170, 60118584", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Sciences Lund, Pediatrics, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital, Lund University"}, "56275157800": {"Name": "Ley D.", "AuthorID": "56275157800", "AffiliationID": "60014077, 60029170, 60118584", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Sciences Lund, Pediatrics, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital, Lund University"}, "7006171979": {"Name": "Marlow N.", "AuthorID": "7006171979", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Academic Neonatology, UCL Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "23471892100": {"Name": "Beardsall K.", "AuthorID": "23471892100", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, University of Cambridge"}, "56908198700": {"Name": "Dunger D.", "AuthorID": "56908198700", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, University of Cambridge"}, "57204812564": {"Name": "van Weissenbruch M.", "AuthorID": "57204812564", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology, Vrije Universiteit University Medical Center, Amsterdam UMC"}, "24304129400": {"Name": "Smith L.E.H.", "AuthorID": "24304129400", "AffiliationID": "60030521, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Harvard Medical School, Boston Children's Hospital"}, "15845833400": {"Name": "Hamdani M.", "AuthorID": "15845833400", "AffiliationID": "122504722", "AffiliationName": "Global Clinical Development, Rare Metabolic Diseases, Shire, a Takeda Company"}, "57193763056": {"Name": "Barton N.", "AuthorID": "57193763056", "AffiliationID": "122504722", "AffiliationName": "Global Clinical Development, Rare Metabolic Diseases, Shire, a Takeda Company"}, "57204729345": {"Name": "Mangili A.", "AuthorID": "57204729345", "AffiliationID": "113880870", "AffiliationName": "Global Clinical Development, Rare Metabolic Diseases, Shire, a Takeda Company"}, "7007157089": {"Name": "Hellstr\u00f6m A.", "AuthorID": "7007157089", "AffiliationID": "60027675", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
