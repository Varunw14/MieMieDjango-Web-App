Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Three-dimensional (3D) printing application is a promising method for bone tissue engineering. For enhanced bone tissue regeneration, it is essential to have printable composite materials with appealing properties such as construct porous, mechanical strength, thermal properties, controlled degradation rates, and the presence of bioactive materials. In this study, polycaprolactone (PCL), gelatin (GEL), bacterial cellulose (BC), and different hydroxyapatite (HA) concentrations were used to fabricate a novel PCL/GEL/BC/HA composite scaffold using 3D printing method for bone tissue engineering applications. Pore structure, mechanical, thermal, and chemical analyses were evaluated. 3D scaffolds with an ideal pore size (~300 \u00b5m) for use in bone tissue engineering were generated. The addition of both bacterial cellulose (BC) and hydroxyapatite (HA) into PCL/GEL scaffold increased cell proliferation and attachment. PCL/GEL/BC/HA composite scaffolds provide a potential for bone tissue engineering applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D printing", "Bacterial cellulose", "Bone tissue engineering", "Gelatin", "Hydroxyapatite", "Polycaprolactone"], "IndexKeywords": ["3-D scaffolds", "Bacterial cellulose", "Bioactive material", "Bone tissue engineering", "Bone tissue regeneration", "Composite scaffolds", "Controlled degradation", "Three-dimensional (3D) printing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85093674274", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Polymers and Plastics", "MATE", "2507"]], "AuthorData": {"57219565122": {"Name": "Cakmak A.M.", "AuthorID": "57219565122", "AffiliationID": "60027981", "AffiliationName": "Center for Nanotechnology & Biomaterials Application and Research (NBUAM), Marmara University"}, "57191963506": {"Name": "Unal S.", "AuthorID": "57191963506", "AffiliationID": "60027981", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurological Sciences, Marmara University"}, "6603890996": {"Name": "Oktar F.N.", "AuthorID": "6603890996", "AffiliationID": "60027981", "AffiliationName": "Center for Nanotechnology & Biomaterials Application and Research (NBUAM), Marmara University"}, "57201480882": {"Name": "Sengor M.", "AuthorID": "57201480882", "AffiliationID": "60027981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Metallurgy and Materials Engineering, Faculty of Technology, Marmara University"}, "24338101800": {"Name": "Ekren N.", "AuthorID": "24338101800", "AffiliationID": "60027981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Faculty of Technology, Marmara University"}, "12797373800": {"Name": "Gunduz O.", "AuthorID": "12797373800", "AffiliationID": "60027981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Metallurgy and Materials Engineering, Faculty of Technology, Marmara University"}, "57190254873": {"Name": "Sahin A.", "AuthorID": "57190254873", "AffiliationID": "60027981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine/Genetic and Metabolic Diseases Research and Investigation Center, Marmara University"}, "24070966200": {"Name": "Kalaskar D.M.", "AuthorID": "24070966200", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60176023", "AffiliationName": "UCL Division of Surgery and Interventional Sciences, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
