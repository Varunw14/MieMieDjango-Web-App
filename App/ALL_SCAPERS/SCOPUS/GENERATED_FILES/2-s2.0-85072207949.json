When acetonitrile (MeCN) is used in the preparation of mobile phases the main solute characteristics affecting the chromatographic behavior of analytes are the molecular size and the hydrogen-bonding (both acidity and basicity) interactions. The former property is more favorable in the acetonitrile-rich mobile phase, reducing thus the retention, but the latter reveals a higher affinity for the water layer adsorbed on the stationary phase, enhancing retention. However, if the aprotic acetonitrile is replaced by methanol, a hydrogen-bond acidic solvent, solute hydrogen-bond basicity does not contribute any more to retention, quite the opposite. Thus, a slightly different selectivity is observed in methanol/water than in acetonitrile/water. Normal-phase mode and HILIC-MeCN share the same main factors affecting retention. For reversed-phase and immobilized artificial membrane (IAM) chromatography, the solute molecular size increase retention because of the lower amount of energy required in the formation of a cavity in the solvated stationary phase. On the contrary, the analyte hydrogen-bond basicity favors interactions with the hydroorganic mobile phase and reduces retention. The determined parameters justify the reversed selectivity commonly observed in HILIC in reference to reversed-phase. In most instances, the least retained solutes in reversed-phase are the most retained in HILIC.", "AuthorKeywords": ["HILIC", "IAM", "LFER", "Normal-phase", "Reversed-phase"], "IndexKeywords": ["Abraham solvation parameter model", "HILIC", "Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatographies", "Immobilized artificial membrane chromatographies", "LFER", "Linear free energy relationships", "Normal phase", "Reversed phase"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072207949", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"]], "AuthorData": {"8703351900": {"Name": "Subirats X.", "AuthorID": "8703351900", "AffiliationID": "60001576", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedicine (IBUB) and Department of Chemical Engineering and Analytical Chemistry, Universitat de Barcelona"}, "56929682600": {"Name": "Ros\u00e9s M.", "AuthorID": "56929682600", "AffiliationID": "60001576", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedicine (IBUB) and Department of Chemical Engineering and Analytical Chemistry, Universitat de Barcelona"}, "7202901240": {"Name": "Abraham M.H.", "AuthorID": "7202901240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
