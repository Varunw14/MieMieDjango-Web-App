We followed scoping review method recommended by Arksey and O\u2019Malley. Our inclusion criteria were based on three concepts: populations (stateless and undocumented people), issues (healthcare policies and regulations), and settings (10 ASEAN countries). Our findings suggest that none of the ASEAN countries have explicit healthcare policies for stateless people except Thailand. We also observed that ratification of international human rights treaties relating to the right to health does not necessarily translate into the provision of healthcare policies for stateless population. Although Thailand seems like the only country among 10 ASIAN countries having health policies for stateless populations in the country, the question remains whether having a policy would lead to a proper implementation by ensuring right to health.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ASEAN", "Health for all", "Right to health", "Statelessness", "Undocumented people"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075332652", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57211281751": {"Name": "Barua P.", "AuthorID": "57211281751", "AffiliationID": "60018391", "AffiliationName": "Independent Evaluation and Research Cell (IERC), BRAC International"}, "57191349419": {"Name": "Narattharaksa K.", "AuthorID": "57191349419", "AffiliationID": "60022498", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medical Science, Naresuan University"}, "55321437800": {"Name": "Bangpan M.", "AuthorID": "55321437800", "AffiliationID": "60117701, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Evidence for Policy and Practice Information and Co-ordinating Centre (EPPI-Centre), Department of Social Science, UCL Institute of Education"}, "55173676600": {"Name": "Suphanchaimat R.", "AuthorID": "55173676600", "AffiliationID": "60015728", "AffiliationName": "International Health Policy Program (IHPP), Ministry of Public Health"}, "14015058100": {"Name": "Chaiyakunapruk N.", "AuthorID": "14015058100", "AffiliationID": "60025488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacotherapy, College of Pharmacy, University of Utah"}}}
