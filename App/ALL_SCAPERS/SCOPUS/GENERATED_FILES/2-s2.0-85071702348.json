This study aimed to review the medications of people living with HIV (PLWH) and HIV-negative controls in the POPPY study and evaluate the frequency of polypharmacy and potential drug-drug interactions (PDDIs). Methods: PDDIs between non-antiretroviral (ARV) drugs were analysed using the Lexicomp database, and PDDIs between non-ARV and ARV drugs using the Liverpool drug interaction database. Between-group differences were assessed using c2, Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results: This analysis included 698 PLWH \u226550 years, 374 PLWH <50 years and 304 HIV-negative controls \u226550 years. The prevalence of polypharmacy was 65.8% in older PLWH, 48.1% in younger PLWH and 13.2% in the HIV-negative group. When ARVs were excluded, 29.8% of older PLWH and 14.2% of younger PLWH had polypharmacy. The prevalence of \u22651 PDDI involving non-ARV drugs was 36.1%, 20.3% and 16.4%, respectively, in older PLWH, younger PLWH and HIV-negative controls. In PLWH the prevalence of \u22651 PDDI involving ARV and non-ARV drugs was 57.3% in older PLWH and 32.4% in younger PLWH. Conclusions: Polypharmacy and PDDIs involving non-ARV/ ARV drugs and non-ARV/non-ARV drugs were common among older PLWH, highlighting the need for increased awareness and additional research on all types of PDDI.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Anti-Retroviral Agents", "Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active", "CD4 Lymphocyte Count", "Drug Interactions", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Polypharmacy", "Risk Factors", "United Kingdom", "Viral Load", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071702348", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57210852825": {"Name": "Halloran M.O.", "AuthorID": "57210852825", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, Trinity College Dublin"}, "57210852866": {"Name": "Boyle C.", "AuthorID": "57210852866", "AffiliationID": "60019449", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacy Department, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital"}, "57210853489": {"Name": "Kehoe B.", "AuthorID": "57210853489", "AffiliationID": "60019449", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacy Department, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital"}, "42160994800": {"Name": "Bagkeris E.", "AuthorID": "42160994800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "56466212800": {"Name": "Sabin C.", "AuthorID": "56466212800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "24471642700": {"Name": "Mallon P.", "AuthorID": "24471642700", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, University College Dublin"}, "57203678070": {"Name": "Post F.A.", "AuthorID": "57203678070", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57210854159": {"Name": "Vera J.", "AuthorID": "57210854159", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Brighton and Sussex University, Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "57206923926": {"Name": "Williams I.", "AuthorID": "57206923926", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "NHS Mortimer Market Centre"}, "57203666870": {"Name": "Anderson J.", "AuthorID": "57203666870", "AffiliationID": "60005523", "AffiliationName": "Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "11638976900": {"Name": "Winston A.", "AuthorID": "11638976900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Imperial College London"}, "7004703572": {"Name": "Boffito M.", "AuthorID": "7004703572", "AffiliationID": "60002484", "AffiliationName": "St Stephen's AIDS Trust, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital"}, "36242445300": {"Name": "Sachikonye M.", "AuthorID": "36242445300", "AffiliationID": "60138902", "AffiliationName": "iBase"}}}
