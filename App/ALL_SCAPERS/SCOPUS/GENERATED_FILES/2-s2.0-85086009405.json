Using a low-cost SLA 3D printer and freeware design software, a high surface area holder for a magnetic stirrer bead was developed and 3D printed containing p-toluenesulfonic acid. The devices were used to efficiently catalyze Mannich reactions in excellent yields and it was demonstrated that the devices can be re-used up to 5-times with excellent reproducibility.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Design and Development", "Design softwares", "High surface area", "Magnetic stirrers", "Mannich reactions", "Novel design", "Ptoluenesulfonic acid", "Reproducibilities"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086009405", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (miscellaneous)", "CHEM", "1601"], ["Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)", "CENG", "1501"], ["Process Chemistry and Technology", "CENG", "1508"], ["Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes", "CENG", "1507"]], "AuthorData": {"56258044400": {"Name": "Penny M.R.", "AuthorID": "56258044400", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "7102480402": {"Name": "Hilton S.T.", "AuthorID": "7102480402", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}}}
