I will analyse how Peruvian prisons have been historically used as sites of exclusion for political opponents of the Peruvian state. Then, through an analysis of literary responses to the massacres and the wider conflict, I will demonstrate how cultural producers have sought to recover Shining Path memories of violence, in order to highlight both the persistent socioeconomic conditions that precipitated Shining Path\u2019s insurrection and the continuing impunity for perpetrators of state violence. Finally, I will show that the recuperation of Shining Path memories in literary sources is undermined by the continuing silence of El Front\u00f3n in Lima\u2019s memoryscape, and say what this tells us about the limits of acceptable memory discourse in present day Peru.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cultural memory", "internal armed conflict", "Peruvian literature", "political violence", "Prison massacres", "Shining Path"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092488939", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["History", "ARTS", "1202"]], "AuthorData": {"57219395262": {"Name": "Willis D.", "AuthorID": "57219395262", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of the Americas, University College London"}}}
