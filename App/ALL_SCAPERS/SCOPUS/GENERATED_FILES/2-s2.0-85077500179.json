Benefitting from the high contrast of optical properties between amorphous and crystalline GST, the three proposed structures can act as reconfigurable and nonvolatile modulators and switches with excellent modulation depth 14 dB and fast response time in subnanosecond while possessing small footprints, simple frameworks, and easy fabrication. We provide solutions to design active devices in MIM waveguide systems and can find potential applications in more compact all-optical circuits for information processing and storage.", "AuthorKeywords": ["metal-insulator-metal", "phase-change material", "plasmon-induced transparency", "plasmonic modulator"], "IndexKeywords": ["Fast response time", "Induced transparency", "Metal insulator metals", "Metal-insulator-metal waveguides", "Modulation depth", "Small footprints", "Telecommunication bands", "Waveguide systems"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077500179", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57197772732": {"Name": "Zhang Z.", "AuthorID": "57197772732", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "National University of Defense Technology, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences"}, "56518336500": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "56518336500", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "National University of Defense Technology, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences"}, "56732089500": {"Name": "Huang J.", "AuthorID": "56732089500", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "National University of Defense Technology, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences"}, "57013633200": {"Name": "Chen D.", "AuthorID": "57013633200", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "National University of Defense Technology, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences"}, "57202129877": {"Name": "Xu S.", "AuthorID": "57202129877", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "National University of Defense Technology, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences"}, "57210391800": {"Name": "Xie W.", "AuthorID": "57210391800", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "National University of Defense Technology, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences"}, "16023467700": {"Name": "Yang J.", "AuthorID": "16023467700", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "National University of Defense Technology, Center of Material Science"}, "57192831289": {"Name": "Han Y.", "AuthorID": "57192831289", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "National University of Defense Technology, Center of Material Science"}, "55491491300": {"Name": "He X.", "AuthorID": "55491491300", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "National University of Defense Technology, Center of Material Science"}, "57208086316": {"Name": "Bai W.", "AuthorID": "57208086316", "AffiliationID": "60003302, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Optics and Electronics"}}}
