However, the large number of tunable parameters makes it difficult to identify optimal design \u201csweet spots\u201d without guiding principles. Here, we combine superselectivity theory with soft matter physics into a unified theoretical framework and we prove its validity using blood brain barrier cells as target. We apply our approach to polymersomes functionalized with targeting ligands to identify the most selective combination of parameters in terms of particle size, brush length and density, as well as tether length, affinity, and ligand number. We show that the combination of multivalent interactions into multiplexed systems enable interaction as a function of the cell phenotype, that is, which receptors are expressed. We thus propose the design of a \u201cbar-coding\u201d targeting approach that can be tailor-made to unique cell populations enabling personalized therapies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Blood-brain barrier", "Guiding principles", "Multiplexed systems", "Multivalent interactions", "Personalized therapies", "Soft-matter physics", "Theoretical framework", "Tunable parameter", "Animals", "Blood-Brain Barrier", "Cattle", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Humans", "Models, Biological", "Nanoparticles", "Rats"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078874209", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"40561700700": {"Name": "Tian X.", "AuthorID": "40561700700", "AffiliationID": "60001455", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physical Science and Information Technology, Anhui University"}, "57204254218": {"Name": "Battaglia G.", "AuthorID": "57204254218", "AffiliationID": "60032907", "AffiliationName": "Instituci\u00f3 Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avan\u00e7ats"}, "25622447800": {"Name": "Angioletti-Uberti S.", "AuthorID": "25622447800", "AffiliationID": "60012820, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}}}
