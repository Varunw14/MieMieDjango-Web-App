METHODS: MEDLINE/PubMed was systematically screened for studies reporting on LT in TAVI patients. Incidence [both clinical and subclinical, i.e. detected with computed tomography (CT)] of LT was the primary end point of the study. Predictors of LT evaluated at multivariable analysis and impact of LT on stroke were the secondary ones. RESULTS: Eighteen studies encompassing 11 124 patients evaluating incidence of LT were included. Pooled incidence of LT was 0.43% per month [5.16% per year, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21-0.72, I2 = 98%]. Pooled incidence of subclinical LT was 1.36% per month (16.32% per year, 95% CI 0.71-2.19, I2 = 94%). Clinical LT was less frequent (0.04% per month, 0.48% per year, 95% CI 0.00-0.19, I2 = 93%). LT increased the risk of stroke [odds ratio (OR) 4.21, 95% CI 1.27-13.98], and was more frequent in patients with a valve diameter of 28-mm (OR 2.89: 1.55-5.8), for balloon-expandable (OR 8: 2.1-9.7) or after valve-in-valve procedures (OR 17.1: 3.1-84.9). Oral anticoagulation therapy reduced the risk of LT (OR 0.43, 95% CI: 0.22-0.84, I2 = 64%), as well as the mean transvalvular gradient. CONCLUSIONS: LT represents an infrequent event after TAVI, despite increasing risk of stroke. Given its full reversal with warfarin, in high-risk patients (those with valve-in-valve procedures, balloon expandable or large-sized devices), a protocol which includes a control CT appears reasonable.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cerebrovascular events", "Leaflet thrombosis", "Stroke", "Transcatheter aortic valve implantation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anticoagulants", "Aortic Valve Stenosis", "Computed Tomography Angiography", "Female", "Heart Valve Prosthesis", "Humans", "Male", "Observational Studies as Topic", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Risk Factors", "Stroke", "Thrombosis", "Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071705841", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"36604133600": {"Name": "D'Ascenzo F.", "AuthorID": "36604133600", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin"}, "57202077524": {"Name": "Saglietto A.", "AuthorID": "57202077524", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin"}, "57208900115": {"Name": "Cortese M.", "AuthorID": "57208900115", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin"}, "7006570904": {"Name": "Moretti C.", "AuthorID": "7006570904", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin"}, "35169036200": {"Name": "D'Amico M.", "AuthorID": "35169036200", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin"}, "26039001600": {"Name": "Conrotto F.", "AuthorID": "26039001600", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin"}, "26027278400": {"Name": "Salizzoni S.", "AuthorID": "26027278400", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiac Surgery, Cardiovascular and Thoracic Department, University of Turin"}, "57210852408": {"Name": "Atzeni F.", "AuthorID": "57210852408", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiac Surgery, Cardiovascular and Thoracic Department, University of Turin"}, "57206451981": {"Name": "Rinaldi M.", "AuthorID": "57206451981", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiac Surgery, Cardiovascular and Thoracic Department, University of Turin"}, "24401460900": {"Name": "Latib A.", "AuthorID": "24401460900", "AffiliationID": "60082964", "AffiliationName": "Interventional Cardiology Unit, Cardiothoracic and Vascular Department, San Raffaele Scientific Institute"}, "27367956000": {"Name": "Franzone A.", "AuthorID": "27367956000", "AffiliationID": "60069922, 60010987", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Swiss Cardiovascular Center Bern, Bern University Hospital"}, "26665263900": {"Name": "Barbanti M.", "AuthorID": "26665263900", "AffiliationID": "60010146", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiology, Ferrarotto Hospital, University of Catania"}, "6507483548": {"Name": "Nietlispach F.", "AuthorID": "6507483548", "AffiliationID": "60019619", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Clinic, University Hospital of Zurich"}, "15759946800": {"Name": "Holy E.W.", "AuthorID": "15759946800", "AffiliationID": "60019619", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Clinic, University Hospital of Zurich"}, "6506017118": {"Name": "Burriesci G.", "AuthorID": "6506017118", "AffiliationID": "110119807", "AffiliationName": "Ri.MED Foundation"}, "57217043578": {"Name": "De Paoli A.", "AuthorID": "57217043578", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Radiology Unit, Department of Surgical Science, University of Turin"}, "6603362124": {"Name": "Fonio P.", "AuthorID": "6603362124", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Radiology Unit, Department of Surgical Science, University of Turin"}, "35327720800": {"Name": "Perl L.", "AuthorID": "35327720800", "AffiliationID": "60005037, 60005681", "AffiliationName": "Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University"}}}
