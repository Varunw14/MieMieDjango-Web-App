Evidence regarding the ideal follow-up strategy and the significance of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) kinetics after treatment is needed. In this study, we aimed to assess the value of the percentage of PSA reduction (%PSA reduction) after FT in predicting the likelihood of any additional treatment or any radical treatment. We retrospectively analysed a multicentre cohort of 703 men receiving FT for low- and intermediate-risk PCa. Overall, the rates of any additional treatment and any radical treatment were 30% and 13%, respectively. The median follow-up period was 41 mo. The median %PSA reduction after FT was 73%. At Cox multivariable analysis, %PSA reduction was an independent predictor of any additional treatment (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.96; p < 0.001) and radical treatment (HR: 0.97; p < 0.001) after FT. For %PSA reduction of>90%, the probability of any additional treatment within 5 yr was 20%. Conversely, for %PSA reduction of <10%, the probability of receiving any additional treatment within 5 yr was roughly 70%. This study is the first to assess the role of %PSA reduction in the largest multicentre cohort of men receiving FT for PCa. Given the lack of standardised follow-up strategies in the FT field, the use of the %PSA reduction should be considered. Patient summary: The percentage of prostate-specific antigen reduction is a useful tool to assess men following focal therapy (FT). It can assist the urologist in setting up an appropriate follow-up and during post-FT patient counselling.\u00a9 2020Percentage of prostate-specific antigen reduction is a useful tool to assess men following focal therapy for localised prostate cancer.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Focal therapy", "High-intensity focused ultrasound", "Minimally invasive therapy", "Outcome", "Prostate cancer", "Therapy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084828369", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"57169977600": {"Name": "Stabile A.", "AuthorID": "57169977600", "AffiliationID": "60123796, 60004158", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Institut Mutualiste Montsouris and Universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes"}, "7102168325": {"Name": "Montorsi F.", "AuthorID": "7102168325", "AffiliationID": "60009622, 60082964", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology and Division of Experimental Oncology, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"}, "9234389400": {"Name": "Briganti A.", "AuthorID": "9234389400", "AffiliationID": "60009622, 60082964", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology and Division of Experimental Oncology, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"}, "55199046500": {"Name": "Orczyk C.", "AuthorID": "55199046500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "7004667094": {"Name": "Emberton M.", "AuthorID": "7004667094", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "7402982572": {"Name": "Moore C.M.", "AuthorID": "7402982572", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "55255733900": {"Name": "Moschini M.", "AuthorID": "55255733900", "AffiliationID": "60033223", "AffiliationName": "Klinik f\u00fcr Urologie, Luzerner Kantonsspital"}, "6602729153": {"Name": "Cathala N.", "AuthorID": "6602729153", "AffiliationID": "60123796, 60004158", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Institut Mutualiste Montsouris and Universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes"}, "6603913119": {"Name": "Cathelineau X.", "AuthorID": "6603913119", "AffiliationID": "60123796, 60004158", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Institut Mutualiste Montsouris and Universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes"}, "55401743300": {"Name": "Sanchez-Salas R.", "AuthorID": "55401743300", "AffiliationID": "60123796, 60004158", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Institut Mutualiste Montsouris and Universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes"}, "55646665800": {"Name": "Giganti F.", "AuthorID": "55646665800", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7402266611": {"Name": "Allen C.", "AuthorID": "7402266611", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57220423487": {"Name": "Punwani S.", "AuthorID": "57220423487", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8147855500": {"Name": "Ahmed H.U.", "AuthorID": "8147855500", "AffiliationID": "60012558, 60111785, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial Urology, Charing Cross Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}}}
