At present, however, they are too expensive and thus economically unattractive. Optimizing flow batteries is thus an active area of research, with the aim of reducing cost by maximizing performance. This work addresses microstructural electrode optimizations by providing a modeling framework based on pore-networks to study the multiphysics involved in a flow battery, with a specific focus on pore-scale structure and its impact on transport processes. The proposed pore network approach was extremely cheap in computation cost (compared to direct numerical simulation) and therefore was used for parametric sweeps to search for optimum electrode structures in a reasonable time. It was found that that increasing porosity generally helps performance by increasing the permeability and flow rate at a given pressure drop, despite reducing reactive surface area per unit volume. As a more nuanced structural study, it was found that aligning fibers in the direction of flow helps performance by increasing permeability but showed diminishing returns beyond slight alignment. The proposed model was demonstrated in the context of a hydrogen bromine flow battery but could be applied to any system of interest.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Battery performance", "Electrode microstructures", "Electrode optimization", "Electrode structure", "Energy storage technologies", "Pore-network modeling", "Reactive surface area", "Renewable energy source"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073235820", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Electrochemistry", "CHEM", "1603"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"56701909800": {"Name": "Sadeghi M.", "AuthorID": "56701909800", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, McGill University"}, "56389335800": {"Name": "Kok M.", "AuthorID": "56389335800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56296920800": {"Name": "Aghighi M.", "AuthorID": "56296920800", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, McGill University"}, "39262078700": {"Name": "Merle G.", "AuthorID": "39262078700", "AffiliationID": "60006558", "AffiliationName": "Division of Orthopedic Surgery, McGill University Health Centre"}, "57211276523": {"Name": "Aganou M.", "AuthorID": "57211276523", "AffiliationID": "60014171", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Waterloo"}, "6507302334": {"Name": "Gostick J.", "AuthorID": "6507302334", "AffiliationID": "60014171", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Waterloo"}, "7003568041": {"Name": "Barralet J.", "AuthorID": "7003568041", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dentistry, McGill University"}}}
