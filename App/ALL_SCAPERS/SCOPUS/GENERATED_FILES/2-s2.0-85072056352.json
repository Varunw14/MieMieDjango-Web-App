Barriers and facilitators to engagement from family carers and people in early stages of dementia have been explored. However, specific barriers and facilitators to co-research with people with dementia have not previously been investigated. Objective: To discover the facilitators of, and barriers to, involving people with dementia as co-researchers, from the perspectives of people with dementia, gatekeepers (family caregivers, ethics committee members, service providers) and researchers. Design: Thematic analysis of data from individual interviews about the co-research experience. Results: Four themes emerged from interviews with 19 participants (five people with dementia): \u201cgetting one's head round it\u201d (assumptions about research and dementia; different forms of language); practicalities (eg transport; accessibility of communication); \u201cthis feeling of safety\u201d (perceptions of danger, protectiveness and opportunities for building trust); and motivations (\u201cmaking a difference\u201d and \u201ckeeping doing\u201d). Conclusions: Findings both replicate and extend previous knowledge on PPI in dementia. Cognitive capacity of potential co-researchers with dementia is only a part of the picture, with attitudes and expectations of researchers, gatekeepers and people with dementia also forming barriers. Researcher education, adequate resourcing, and both creativity and flexibility are needed to support recruitment of co-researchers with dementia and to enable meaningful co-research.", "AuthorKeywords": ["barriers", "co-research", "dementia", "facilitators", "peer research", "qualitative"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Caregivers", "Communication", "Dementia", "Female", "Focus Groups", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Patient Participation", "Qualitative Research", "Research Design", "Severity of Illness Index", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072056352", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57210966002": {"Name": "Waite J.", "AuthorID": "57210966002", "AffiliationID": "60170416", "AffiliationName": "Greenwich CMHT for Older Adults, Memorial Hospital, Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6602617245": {"Name": "Charlesworth G.", "AuthorID": "6602617245", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "6507156058": {"Name": "Poland F.", "AuthorID": "6507156058", "AffiliationID": "60011775", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park"}}}
