Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Gerontological Society of America.Objectives: Modeling the health and care trajectories of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) is essential to identify inequalities and support needs, yet because of the small sample of LGB people in any one survey, current evidence relies on studies that have poor generalizability and low power. This study assesses the magnitude of health inequalities among older LGB people across 10 outcomes, informed by evidence on the health trajectories and distinct LGB history of the United Kingdom. Method: A systematic review was conducted of representative data sources on older LGB and heterosexual people's health and care status in the United Kingdom. Individual Participant Data (IPD) meta-analysis was employed to synthesize data from up to 25 different sources. To account for the intricacies of individual data sets, the analysis employed a two-stage approach where an odds ratio and standard error was calculated for each data set individually, before being meta-analyzed through DerSimonian and Laird random effects models. Results: Among men aged 50+, being gay, bisexual, or having another nonheterosexual orientation is associated with an increased risk of reporting long-term illness and health-related limitations. Indicators of mental health also suggest that gay and bisexual men are more likely to report low life satisfaction and to have attempted suicide over their life time. Among women, differences are apparent with regards to self-rated health as well as with engagement with risky health behaviors. Discussion: The findings corroborate the minority stress theory, but they also generate new questions for researchers around when and how these inequalities emerge.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Inequality", "Life course", "Minority stress", "Sexuality", "Well-being"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091125587", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Life-span and Life-course Studies", "SOCI", "3319"]], "AuthorData": {"25824329300": {"Name": "Kneale D.", "AuthorID": "25824329300", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "EPPI-Centre, UCL Institute of Education, University College"}, "55574208395": {"Name": "Thomas J.", "AuthorID": "55574208395", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "EPPI-Centre, UCL Institute of Education, University College"}, "56640690300": {"Name": "French R.", "AuthorID": "56640690300", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, Cardiff University"}}}
