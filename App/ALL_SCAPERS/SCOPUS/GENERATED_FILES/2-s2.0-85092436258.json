Even with robotic kinematic information, automatically segmenting surgical steps presents numerous challenges because surgical demonstrations are characterized by high variability in style, duration and order of actions. In order to extract discriminative features from the kinematic signals and boost recognition accuracy, we propose a multi-task recurrent neural network for simultaneous recognition of surgical gestures and estimation of a novel formulation of surgical task progress. To show the effectiveness of the presented approach, we evaluate its application on the JIGSAWS dataset, that is currently the only publicly available dataset for surgical gesture recognition featuring robot kinematic data. We demonstrate that recognition performance improves in multi-task frameworks with progress estimation without any additional manual labelling and training.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Discriminative features", "Kinematic information", "Kinematic signals", "Ordering of actions", "Progress estimations", "Recognition accuracy", "Robot kinematics", "Surgical gestures"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092436258", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57210786015": {"Name": "Van Amsterdam B.", "AuthorID": "57210786015", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences (WEISS)"}, "7006920406": {"Name": "Clarkson M.J.", "AuthorID": "7006920406", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences (WEISS)"}, "57217833493": {"Name": "Stoyanov D.", "AuthorID": "57217833493", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences (WEISS)"}}}
