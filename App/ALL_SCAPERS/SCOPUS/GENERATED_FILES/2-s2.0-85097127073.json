We investigate the possibility of detecting baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) at redshifts z > 7.6 for use as a standard ruler. We use data from the hydrodynamic simulation BLUETIDES in conjunction with the gigaparsec-scale Outer Rim simulation and a model for patchy reionization to create mock RST High Latitude Survey grism data for Lyman \u03b1 emission line selected galaxies at redshifts z = 7.4 to z = 10, covering 2280 deg2. We measure the monopoles of galaxies in the mock catalogues and fit the BAO features. We find that for a line flux of L = 7 \u00d7 10\u221217 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122, the 5\u03c3 detection limit for the current design, the BAO feature is partially detectable (measured in three out of four survey quadrants analysed independently). The resulting root mean square error on the angular diameter distance to z = 7.7 is 7.9 per cent. If we improve the detection sensitivity by a factor of two (i.e. L = 3.5 \u00d7 10\u221217 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122), the distance error reduces to 1.4 per cent. We caution that many more factors are yet to be modelled, including dust obscuration, the damping wing due to the intergalactic medium, and low redshift interlopers. If these issues do not strongly affect the results, or different observational techniques (such as use of multiple lines) can mitigate them, RST, or similar instruments may be able to constrain the angular diameter distance to the high redshift universe.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dark energy", "Galaxies: statistics", "Large-scale structure of Universe"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85097127073", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57194787675": {"Name": "Satpathy S.", "AuthorID": "57194787675", "AffiliationID": "60027950", "AffiliationName": "McWilliams Center for Cosmology, Carnegie Mellon University"}, "57219583866": {"Name": "An Z.", "AuthorID": "57219583866", "AffiliationID": "60027950", "AffiliationName": "McWilliams Center for Cosmology, Carnegie Mellon University"}, "35299209400": {"Name": "Croft R.A.C.", "AuthorID": "35299209400", "AffiliationID": "60170546", "AffiliationName": "ARC Centre of Excellence for All Sky Astrophysics in 3 Dimensions (ASTRO 3D)"}, "57200591754": {"Name": "Matteo T.D.", "AuthorID": "57200591754", "AffiliationID": "60170546", "AffiliationName": "ARC Centre of Excellence for All Sky Astrophysics in 3 Dimensions (ASTRO 3D)"}, "56152658800": {"Name": "Tenneti A.", "AuthorID": "56152658800", "AffiliationID": "60027950", "AffiliationName": "McWilliams Center for Cosmology, Carnegie Mellon University"}, "54580801600": {"Name": "Feng Y.", "AuthorID": "54580801600", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Berkeley Center for Cosmological Physics, Department of Physics, University of California Berkeley"}, "7004112645": {"Name": "Heitmann K.", "AuthorID": "7004112645", "AffiliationID": "60028609", "AffiliationName": "HEP, MCS Divisions, Argonne National Laboratory"}, "35079263400": {"Name": "Rossi G.", "AuthorID": "35079263400", "AffiliationID": "60027884", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Sejong University"}}}
