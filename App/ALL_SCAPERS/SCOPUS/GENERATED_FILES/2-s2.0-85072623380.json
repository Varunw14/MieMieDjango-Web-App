We recently identified germline loss of function mutations in Janus Associated Kinase 1 (JAK1) causing primary immunodeficiency characterized by infections and associated with early onset, fatal high-grade bladder carcinoma. Somatic mutations in JAK1, required for immune cell signaling in response to interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3), have been associated with several non-hematopoietic and hematopoietic cancer cell types but pathogenic mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate that JAK1 is required for the intrinsic IFN\u03b3 response of urothelial cells impacting immunogenicity and cell survival. Specifically, JAK1-deficient urothelial cells showed reduced surface expression of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and programmed death-ligand-1 (PD-L1) after IFN\u03b3 stimulation and were resistant to IFN\u03b3-induced apoptosis and lymphocyte-mediated killing. In addition, we identify a previously unknown role for IFN\u03b3 signaling in modulating urothelial differentiation. Together, our findings support a role for urothelial cell JAK1 in immune surveillance and development of bladder cancer. Our results have implications for patients with rare JAK1 PID and, more broadly, inform development of biomarker and targeted therapies for urothelial carcinoma.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bladder cancer", "IFN\u03b3 signaling", "immunodeficiency", "JAK1", "urothelium"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomarkers", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cytotoxicity, Immunologic", "Disease Susceptibility", "Epithelial Cells", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Humans", "Immunohistochemistry", "Interferon-gamma", "Janus Kinase 1", "Lymphocytes", "Mucous Membrane", "RNA, Messenger", "STAT1 Transcription Factor", "Telomerase", "Urinary Bladder Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072623380", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"55700841700": {"Name": "Daza-Cajigal V.", "AuthorID": "55700841700", "AffiliationID": "115902509", "AffiliationName": "Human Immunopathology Research Laboratory, Institut d'Investigaci\u00f3 Sanitaria de Palma (IdISPa)"}, "57210969517": {"Name": "Albuquerque A.S.", "AuthorID": "57210969517", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London"}, "8778070100": {"Name": "Burns S.O.", "AuthorID": "8778070100", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "37661952100": {"Name": "Pearson J.", "AuthorID": "37661952100", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Jack Birch Unit, Department of Biology, York Biomedical Research Institute, University of York"}, "14028268700": {"Name": "Hinley J.", "AuthorID": "14028268700", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Jack Birch Unit, Department of Biology, York Biomedical Research Institute, University of York"}, "56905173600": {"Name": "Mason A.S.", "AuthorID": "56905173600", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Jack Birch Unit, Department of Biology, York Biomedical Research Institute, University of York"}, "6508047500": {"Name": "Stahlschmidt J.", "AuthorID": "6508047500", "AffiliationID": "60020454", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, St James's University Hospital"}, "7006023540": {"Name": "Southgate J.", "AuthorID": "7006023540", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Jack Birch Unit, Department of Biology, York Biomedical Research Institute, University of York"}, "7005085037": {"Name": "Thrasher A.J.", "AuthorID": "7005085037", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Section of Molecular and Cellular Immunology, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57208518563": {"Name": "Mishra V.", "AuthorID": "57208518563", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
