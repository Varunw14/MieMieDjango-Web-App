Annals of Neurology published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of American Neurological Association.Objective: Long-term cognitive decline is an adverse outcome after major surgery associated with increased risk for mortality and morbidity. We studied the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum biochemical inflammatory response to a standardized orthopedic surgical procedure and the possible association with long-term changes in cognitive function. We hypothesized that the CSF inflammatory response pattern after surgery would differ in patients having long-term cognitive decline defined as a composite cognitive z score of \u22651.0 compared to patients without long-term cognitive decline at 3 months postsurgery. Methods: Serum and CSF biomarkers of inflammation and blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) integrity were measured preoperatively and up to 48 hours postoperatively, and cognitive function was assessed preoperatively and at 2 to 5 days and 3 months postoperatively. Results: Surgery was associated with a pronounced increase in inflammatory biomarkers in both CSF and blood throughout the 48-hour study period. A principal component (PC) analysis was performed on 52 inflammatory biomarkers. The 2 first PC (PC1 and PC2) construct outcome variables on CSF biomarkers were significantly associated with long-term cognitive decline at 3 months, but none of the PC construct serum variables showed a significant association with long-term cognitive decline at 3 months. Patients both with and patients without long-term cognitive decline showed early transient increases of the astroglial biomarkers S-100B and glial fibrillary acidic protein in CSF, and in BBB permeability (CSF/serum albumin ratio). Interpretation: Surgery rapidly triggers a temporal neuroinflammatory response closely associated with long-term cognitive outcome postsurgery. The findings of this explorative study require validation in a larger surgical patient cohort.
