Their impact on mortality and morbidity is unclear. We conducted a prospective investigation of the VWFADAMTS13 axis in 292 adults (acute IS, n = 103; TIA, n = 80; controls, n = 109) serially from presentation until .6 weeks. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Score (NIHSS) and modified Rankin scale (MRS) were used to assess stroke severity. Presenting median VWF antigen (VWF:Ag)/ADAMTS13Ac ratios were: IS, 2.42 (range, 0.78-9.53); TIA, 1.89 (range, 0.41-8.14); and controls, 1.69 (range, 0.25-15.63). Longitudinally, the median VWF:Ag/ADAMTS13Ac ratio decreased (IS, 2.42 to 1.66; P = .0008; TIA, 1.89 to 0.65; P<.0001). The VWF:Ag/ADAMTS13Ac ratio was higher at presentation in IS patients who died (3.683 vs 2.014; P<.0001). A presenting VWF:Ag/ADAMTS13Ac ratio .2.6 predicted mortality (odds ratio, 6.33; range, 2.22-18.1). Those with a VWF:Ag/ADAMTS13Ac ratio in the highest quartile (.3.091) had 31% increased risk mortality. VWF:Ag/ADAMTS13Ac ratio at presentation of ischemic brain injury was associated with higher MRS (P = .021) and NIHSS scores (P= .029) at follow-up. Thrombolysis resulted in prompt reduction of the VWF:Ag/ADAMTS13Ac ratio and significant improvement in MRS on follow-up. A raised VWF:Ag/ADAMTS13Ac ratio at presentation of acute IS or TIA is associated with increased mortality and poorer functional outcome. A ratio of 2.6 seems to differentiate outcome. Prompt reduction in the ratio in thrombolysed patients was associated with decreased mortality and morbidity. The VWF: Ag/ADAMTS13Ac ratio is a biomarker for the acute impact of an ischemic event and longerterm outcome.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082190524", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"56767367600": {"Name": "Taylor A.", "AuthorID": "56767367600", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (UCLH)"}, "57204021388": {"Name": "Vendramin C.", "AuthorID": "57204021388", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Haemostasis Research Unit, University College London"}, "8709944400": {"Name": "Scully M.", "AuthorID": "8709944400", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "Cardiometabolic Programme, National Institute for Health Research, UCLH/UC Biomedical Research Centre London"}, "57200291434": {"Name": "Singh D.", "AuthorID": "57200291434", "AffiliationID": "100609883", "AffiliationName": "Haemostasis Department, Health Services Laboratory"}, "55624573300": {"Name": "Brown M.M.", "AuthorID": "55624573300", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Research Centre, Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
