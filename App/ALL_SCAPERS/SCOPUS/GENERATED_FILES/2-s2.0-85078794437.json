All rights reserved.Background. Development of amyloidosis post solid-organ transplantation has not been reported, although plasma cell neoplasms are a rare form of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder, which could be complicated by light chain amyloidosis (AL) amyloidosis. Methods. We searched our database of 5112 patients seen between 1994 and 2018 with a diagnosis of amyloidosis post solid-organ transplant. Patients were excluded if the amyloid diagnosis preceded the transplant date. The indication and type of organ transplant were recorded in addition to the amyloidosis type, organs involved, treatment given, and survival. Results. Thirty patients were identified. The median age at diagnosis with amyloidosis was 52 years (range 33\u201377). The median time from transplantation to diagnosis was 10.5 years (0.58\u201336). The grafts were kidney (N = 25, 83.3%), liver (N = 2, 6.7%), heart (N = 2, 6.7%), and combined heart, lung, and kidney (N = 1, 3.3%). The type of amyloidosis was systemic AL (N = 14, 47%), serum amyloid A amyloidosis (AA) (N = 11, 37%), localized AL (N = 3, 10%), wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) (N = 1, 3.3%), and amyloid of uncertain type (N = 1, 3.3%). Renal graft dysfunction was seen in 11 of 25 (44%) cases. Median graft survival was 185 months (96\u2013269), and median survival from diagnosis with amyloidosis was 45 months (2\u201389); median survival by amyloidosis type was localized AL: 64 months (20\u201367), systemic AL: 23.5 months (0\u201395), ATTR amyloidosis: 17 months, and AA, 15 months (0\u201377). Conclusions. This series is the first description of amyloidosis post solid-organ transplant; 30 cases among 5112 amyloid patients >24 years suggests that amyloidosis may occur post solid-organ transplantation with an overall poor survival.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Amyloidosis", "Child", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Graft Rejection", "Humans", "Incidence", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Organ Transplantation", "Risk Factors", "Survival Rate", "Time Factors", "Transplant Recipients", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078794437", "SubjectAreas": [["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"33568211200": {"Name": "Sharpley F.A.", "AuthorID": "33568211200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Amyloidosis & Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine (Royal Free Campus)"}, "16306839900": {"Name": "Fontana M.", "AuthorID": "16306839900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Amyloidosis & Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine (Royal Free Campus)"}, "7005657127": {"Name": "Gilbertson J.A.", "AuthorID": "7005657127", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Amyloidosis & Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine (Royal Free Campus)"}, "7003539031": {"Name": "Gillmore J.D.", "AuthorID": "7003539031", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Amyloidosis & Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine (Royal Free Campus)"}, "35464959200": {"Name": "Hawkins P.N.", "AuthorID": "35464959200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Amyloidosis & Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine (Royal Free Campus)"}, "50361564300": {"Name": "Mahmood S.", "AuthorID": "50361564300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Amyloidosis & Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine (Royal Free Campus)"}, "57196120999": {"Name": "Manwani R.", "AuthorID": "57196120999", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Amyloidosis & Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine (Royal Free Campus)"}, "55343433500": {"Name": "Martinez-Naharro A.", "AuthorID": "55343433500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Amyloidosis & Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine (Royal Free Campus)"}, "56619484400": {"Name": "Quarta C.", "AuthorID": "56619484400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Amyloidosis & Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine (Royal Free Campus)"}, "55985701600": {"Name": "Rezk T.M.", "AuthorID": "55985701600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Amyloidosis & Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine (Royal Free Campus)"}, "14012189400": {"Name": "Rowczenio D.", "AuthorID": "14012189400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Amyloidosis & Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine (Royal Free Campus)"}, "55621355900": {"Name": "Sachchithanantham S.", "AuthorID": "55621355900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Amyloidosis & Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine (Royal Free Campus)"}, "36647033100": {"Name": "Whelan C.J.", "AuthorID": "36647033100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Amyloidosis & Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine (Royal Free Campus)"}, "6506002568": {"Name": "Wechalekar A.D.", "AuthorID": "6506002568", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Amyloidosis & Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine (Royal Free Campus)"}, "7004915734": {"Name": "Lachmann H.J.", "AuthorID": "7004915734", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Amyloidosis & Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine (Royal Free Campus)"}}}
