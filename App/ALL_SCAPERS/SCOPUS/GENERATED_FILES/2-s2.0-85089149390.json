Taking the data deposited in the GISAID database, we made predictions using the IEDB analysis resource (TepiTool) to gauge how variants in the SARS-CoV-2 genome may change peptide binding to the most frequent MHC-class I and -II alleles in Africa, Asia and Europe. We caracterized how a single mutation in the wildtype sequence of of SARS-CoV-2 could influence the peptide binding of SARS-CoV-2 variants to MHC class II, but not to MHC class I alleles. Assuming the ORF8 (L84S) mutation is biologically significant, selective pressure from MHC class II alleles may select for viral varients and subsequently shape the quality and quantity of cellular immune responses aginast SARS-CoV-2. MHC 4-digit typing along with viral sequence analysis should be considered in studies examining clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autoimmunity", "COVID-19", "Cross-reactivity", "Cytokines", "Disease association", "Epitope", "HLA", "MHC", "MHC binding", "Peptides", "SARS", "SARS-CoV-2", "T-cells", "Viral variants"], "IndexKeywords": ["Africa", "Alleles", "Asia", "Betacoronavirus", "Coronavirus Infections", "Europe", "Histocompatibility Antigens Class I", "Histocompatibility Antigens Class II", "Humans", "Pandemics", "Pneumonia, Viral"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089149390", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57208627940": {"Name": "de Sousa E.", "AuthorID": "57208627940", "AffiliationID": "60113882", "AffiliationName": "ImmunoSurgery Unit, Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown, Avenida Bras\u00edlia"}, "57197865346": {"Name": "L\u00e9rias J.R.", "AuthorID": "57197865346", "AffiliationID": "60113882", "AffiliationName": "ImmunoSurgery Unit, Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown, Avenida Bras\u00edlia"}, "7004422039": {"Name": "Maeurer M.", "AuthorID": "7004422039", "AffiliationID": "60031216", "AffiliationName": "I Medical Clinical, University of Mainz"}, "14633861700": {"Name": "Ligeiro D.", "AuthorID": "14633861700", "AffiliationID": "60196684", "AffiliationName": "Lisbon Centre for Blood and Transplantation (Instituto Portugu\u00eas do Sangue e Transplanta\u00e7\u00e3o, IPST"}, "57214602643": {"Name": "Zhang C.", "AuthorID": "57214602643", "AffiliationID": "60069744", "AffiliationName": "Treatment and Research Center for Infectious Diseases, The Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases"}, "55569193600": {"Name": "Wang F.S.", "AuthorID": "55569193600", "AffiliationID": "60069744", "AffiliationName": "Treatment and Research Center for Infectious Diseases, The Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases"}, "6601911681": {"Name": "Agrati C.", "AuthorID": "6601911681", "AffiliationID": "60072494", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Infectious Diseases, Lazzaro Spallanzani"}, "57208096848": {"Name": "Ippolito G.", "AuthorID": "57208096848", "AffiliationID": "60072494", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Infectious Diseases, Lazzaro Spallanzani"}, "57212430874": {"Name": "Osman M.", "AuthorID": "57212430874", "AffiliationID": "60016418, 60071723", "AffiliationName": "York Biomedical Research Institute, University of York, United Kingdom and Emerging and Re-Emerging Diseases, University of Khartoum"}, "12545932500": {"Name": "El-Kafrawy S.A.", "AuthorID": "12545932500", "AffiliationID": "60004582", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Laboratory Technology, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, King Abdulaziz University"}, "23090055800": {"Name": "Azhar E.I.", "AuthorID": "23090055800", "AffiliationID": "60004582", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Laboratory Technology, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, King Abdulaziz University"}, "57216109256": {"Name": "Zumla A.", "AuthorID": "57216109256", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60176023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London and NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, UCL Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
