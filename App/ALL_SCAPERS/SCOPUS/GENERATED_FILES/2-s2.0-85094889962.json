Contact tracing and case isolation are common methods for controlling infectious disease outbreaks. However, the effectiveness of any contact tracing system rests on public engagement. Numerous factors may influence an individual\u2019s willingness to engage with a contact tracing system. Understanding these factors has become urgent during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective To identify facilitators and barriers to uptake of, and engagement with, contact tracing during infectious disease outbreaks. Method A rapid systematic review was conducted to identify papers based on primary research, written in English, and that assessed facilitators, barriers, and other factors associated with the uptake of, and engagement with, a contact tracing system. Principal findings Four themes were identified as facilitators to the uptake of, and engagement with, contact tracing: collective responsibility; personal benefit; co-production of contact tracing systems; and the perception of the system as efficient, rigorous and reliable. Five themes were identified as barriers to the uptake of, and engagement with, contact tracing: privacy concerns; mistrust and/or apprehension; unmet need for more information and support; fear of stigmatization; and mode-specific challenges. Conclusions By focusing on the factors that have been identified, contact tracing services are more likely to get people to engage with them, identify more potentially ill contacts, and reduce transmission.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Betacoronavirus", "Contact Tracing", "Coronavirus Infections", "Disease Outbreaks", "Humans", "Pandemics", "Patient Participation", "Pneumonia, Viral", "Privacy", "Social Responsibility", "Stereotyping", "Trust"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094889962", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55312820100": {"Name": "Megnin-Viggars O.", "AuthorID": "55312820100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Centre for Outcomes Research and Effectiveness, Educational & Health Psychology, University College London"}, "55413209200": {"Name": "Carter P.", "AuthorID": "55413209200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Centre for Outcomes Research and Effectiveness, Educational & Health Psychology, University College London"}, "57188672699": {"Name": "Melendez-Torres G.J.", "AuthorID": "57188672699", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "Peninsula Technology Assessment Group, University of Exeter Medical School"}, "54400611100": {"Name": "Weston D.", "AuthorID": "54400611100", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Emergency Response Department Science & Technology, Behavioural Science Team, Public Health England"}, "7201409301": {"Name": "Rubin G.J.", "AuthorID": "7201409301", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}}}
