Southeast Asian hunter-gatherers also practice egalitarianism, however, and their musical practices represent a seeming anomaly alongside those of many African hunter-gatherer groups. Discussion of \u2018hunter-gatherer musics\u2019 that includes Southeast Asian perspectives has therefore been absent, even though cross-cultural, continent-spanning research with hunter-gatherers is common on topics such as politics, economics, and subsistence. Insights into egalitarianism can be gained through attention to the diversity in hunter-gatherer musical practices. This discussion of Ju|'hoan (Namibia) and Batek (Malaysia) musical practices demonstrates that egalitarianism can be understood in terms of its flexibility.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aesthetics", "diversity", "egalitarianism", "flexibility", "Hunter-gatherer", "polyphony"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075079095", "SubjectAreas": [["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"], ["Music", "ARTS", "1210"]], "AuthorData": {"57210206361": {"Name": "Rudge A.", "AuthorID": "57210206361", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Advanced Studies, University College London"}}}
