Biotechnology and Bioengineering published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Osteochondral tissue engineering aims to regenerate functional tissue-mimicking physiological properties of injured cartilage and its subchondral bone. Given the distinct structural and biochemical difference between bone and cartilage, bilayered scaffolds, and bioreactors are commonly employed. We present an osteochondral culture system which cocultured ATDC5 and MC3T3-E1 cells on an additive manufactured bilayered scaffold in a dual-chamber perfusion bioreactor. Also, finite element models (FEM) based on the microcomputed tomography image of the manufactured scaffold as well as on the computer-aided design (CAD) were constructed; the microenvironment inside the two FEM was studied and compared. In vitro results showed that the coculture system supported osteochondral tissue growth in terms of cell viability, proliferation, distribution, and attachment. In silico results showed that the CAD and the actual manufactured scaffold had significant differences in the flow velocity, differentiation media mixing in the bioreactor and fluid-induced shear stress experienced by the cells. This system was shown to have the desired microenvironment for osteochondral tissue engineering and it can potentially be used as an inexpensive tool for testing newly developed pharmaceutical products for osteochondral defects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["additive tissue engineering", "bilayered scaffold", "coculture", "finite element analysis", "osteochondral tissue engineering"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bilayered scaffolds", "Coculture", "Microcomputed tomography", "Osteochondral defects", "Osteochondral tissue engineering", "Osteochondral tissues", "Pharmaceutical products", "Physiological properties", "Animals", "Bone and Bones", "Cartilage", "Cell Culture Techniques", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Line", "Cell Proliferation", "Cellular Microenvironment", "Coculture Techniques", "Computer Simulation", "Mice", "Tissue Scaffolds", "X-Ray Microtomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072849332", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology", "IMMU", "2402"]], "AuthorData": {"57195615743": {"Name": "Xue R.", "AuthorID": "57195615743", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials, Faculty of Science and Engineering, University of Manchester"}, "57211164224": {"Name": "Chung B.", "AuthorID": "57211164224", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials, Faculty of Science and Engineering, University of Manchester"}, "6602075256": {"Name": "Cartmell S.H.", "AuthorID": "6602075256", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials, Faculty of Science and Engineering, University of Manchester"}, "55581409800": {"Name": "Tamaddon M.", "AuthorID": "55581409800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculo-Skeletal Science, University College London"}, "57188879979": {"Name": "Liu C.", "AuthorID": "57188879979", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculo-Skeletal Science, University College London"}, "55503114300": {"Name": "Carr J.", "AuthorID": "55503114300", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Imaging Facility, University of Manchester"}}}
