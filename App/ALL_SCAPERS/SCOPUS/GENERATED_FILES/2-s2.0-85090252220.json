Objective: The aim of this study was to assess participants' use of key CBT and MI components, the presence of change talk and sustain talk within their responses, and whether these data are associated with drinking outcomes after 3 months. Methods: An exploratory secondary data analysis was conducted on data collected in 2008 from the definitive randomized trial of DYD (N=503). Past week alcohol use at baseline and 3-month follow-up were measured with the TOT-AL. Covariates included baseline alcohol use, age, gender, education level, and word count of the responses. Use of MI and CBT components and presence of change talk and sustain talk were coded by two independent coders (Cohen \u03ba range 0.91-1). Linear model regressions on the subsample of active users (n=410) are presented along with a negative binomial regression. Results: The most commonly used component was the listing of pros and cons of drinking. The number of listed high-risk situations was associated with lower alcohol use at 3-month follow-up (Badj \u22122.15, 95% CI \u22123.92 to \u22120.38, P=.02). Findings on the effects of the percentage of change talk and the number of listed strategies to deal with high-risk situations were inconsistent. Conclusions: An unguided web-based alcohol moderation program can elicit change talk and sustain talk. This secondary analysis suggests that the number of listed high-risk situations can predict alcohol use at 3-month follow-up. Other components show inconsistent findings and should be studied further.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alcohol use", "Cognitive behavioural therapy", "Digital health", "EHealth", "Engagement", "Motivational interviewing", "Self-management"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Alcohol Drinking", "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy", "Data Analysis", "Female", "Humans", "Internet-Based Intervention", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Motivational Interviewing", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090252220", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"57201441067": {"Name": "Mujcic A.", "AuthorID": "57201441067", "AffiliationID": "60008312", "AffiliationName": "Trimbos Institute, Netherlands National Institute of Mental Health and Addiction"}, "16432450600": {"Name": "Linke S.", "AuthorID": "16432450600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "eHealth Unit, Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "26657997700": {"Name": "Hamilton F.", "AuthorID": "26657997700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "eHealth Unit, Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "57218774145": {"Name": "Phillips A.", "AuthorID": "57218774145", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, King's College London"}, "23492587500": {"Name": "Khadjesari Z.", "AuthorID": "23492587500", "AffiliationID": "60000112, 60176145", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park"}}}
