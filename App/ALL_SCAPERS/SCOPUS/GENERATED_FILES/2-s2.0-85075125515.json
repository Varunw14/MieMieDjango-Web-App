KGaA, WeinheimA novel photonic method for remote monitoring of task-related hemodynamic changes in human brain activation is presented. Physiological processes associated with neural activity, such as nano-vibrations due to blood flow and tissue oxygenation in the brain, are detected by remote sensing of nano-acoustic vibrations using temporal spatial analysis of defocused self-interference random patterns. Temporal nanometric changes of the speckle pattern due to visual task-induced hemodynamic responses were tracked by this method. Reversing visual checkerboard stimulation alternated with rest epochs, and responsive signals were identified in occipital lobe using near-infrared spectroscopy. Temporal vibrations associated with these hemodynamic response functions were observed using three different approaches: (a) single spot illumination at active and control areas simultaneously, (b) subspots cross-correlation-based analysis, and (c) multiwavelength measurement using a magnitude-squared wavelet coherence function. Findings show remote sensing of task-specific neural activity in the human brain.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biosensing", "laser speckles", "remote sensing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biosensing", "Cerebral hemodynamics", "Hemodynamic changes", "Hemodynamic response", "Hemodynamic response functions", "Laser speckle", "Multiwavelength measurements", "Physiological process"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075125515", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56340879100": {"Name": "Ozana N.", "AuthorID": "56340879100", "AffiliationID": "60106789, 60002765", "AffiliationName": "The Bar-Ilan Institute of Nanotechnology and Advanced Materials, Bar-Ilan University"}, "7005705399": {"Name": "Zalevsky Z.", "AuthorID": "7005705399", "AffiliationID": "60106789, 60002765", "AffiliationName": "The Bar-Ilan Institute of Nanotechnology and Advanced Materials, Bar-Ilan University"}, "36789839000": {"Name": "Noah J.A.", "AuthorID": "36789839000", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Yale School of Medicine"}, "57188577368": {"Name": "Zhang X.", "AuthorID": "57188577368", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Yale School of Medicine"}, "7402959957": {"Name": "Ono Y.", "AuthorID": "7402959957", "AffiliationID": "60022180", "AffiliationName": "Health Science and Medical Engineering Laboratory, Department of Physiology and Neuroscience, School of Science and Technology, Meiji University"}, "35299240000": {"Name": "Hirsch J.", "AuthorID": "35299240000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
