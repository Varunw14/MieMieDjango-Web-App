Fluid Mech., vol. 850, 2018, pp. 179-211) we described a theory for the evolution of density fronts in a rotating reference frame subject to strong vertical mixing using an asymptotic expansion in small Rossby number, . We found that the front reaches a balanced state where vertical diffusion is balanced by horizontal advection in the buoyancy equation. The depth-averaged buoyancy obeys a nonlinear diffusion equation which admits a similarity solution corresponding to horizontal spreading of the front. Here we use numerical simulations of the full momentum and buoyancy equations to investigate this problem for a wide range of Rossby and Ekman numbers. We examine the accuracy of our asymptotic solution and find that many aspects of the solution are valid for . However, the asymptotic solution departs from the numerical simulations for small Ekman numbers where the dominant balance in the momentum equation changes. We trace the source of this discrepancy to a depth-independent geostrophic flow that develops on both sides of the front and we develop a modification to the theory described in Crowe & Taylor (2018) to account for this geostrophic flow. The refined theory closely matches the numerical simulations, even for . Finally, we develop a new scaling for the intense vertical velocity that can develop in thin bands at the edges of the front.", "AuthorKeywords": ["mixing and dispersion", "ocean circulation", "ocean processes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Asymptotic expansion", "Asymptotic solutions", "Horizontal advection", "Mixing and dispersions", "Nonlinear diffusion equations", "Ocean circulation", "Ocean process", "Rotating reference frame"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073147136", "SubjectAreas": [["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"57202803294": {"Name": "Crowe M.", "AuthorID": "57202803294", "AffiliationID": "60119937, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, University of Cambridge, Centre for Mathematical Sciences"}, "55741154500": {"Name": "Taylor J.", "AuthorID": "55741154500", "AffiliationID": "60119937, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, University of Cambridge, Centre for Mathematical Sciences"}}}
