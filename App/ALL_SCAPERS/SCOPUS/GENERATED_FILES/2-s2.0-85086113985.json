The optimal product formulation for a homogeneous film-forming solution was sought by designing an empirical Box\u2013Behnken model simulation, based on three independent variables: the concentrations of chitosan (1.5\u20132.0% (w/v)), extracted powder-form chestnut extract (0.5\u20131.0% (w/v)) and plasticizer glycerol (30.0\u201390.0% (w/w); determined per mass of polysaccharide). Obtained linear (MC), quadratic (TS or EB), and two-factor interaction (TPC) sets were found to be significant (p < 0.05), to fit well with characteristic experimental data (0.969 < R2 < 0.992), and could be considered predictive. Although all system parameters were influential, the level of polyol played a vital continuous role in defining EB, MC, and TS, while the variation of the chestnut extract caused an expected connected change in affecting TPC. The component relationship formula of chemical mixture fractions (1.93% (w/v) of chitosan, 0.97% (w/v) chestnut extract and 30.0% (w/w) of glycerol) yielded the final applicable material of adequate physico-mechanical properties (MC = 17.0%, TS = 16.7 MPa, EB = 10.4%, and TPC = 19.4 mgGAE gfilm\u22121). Further statistical validation of the concept revealed a sufficient specific accuracy with the computed maximal absolute residual error up to 22.2%. Herein-proposed design methodology can thus be translated to smart packaging fabrication generally.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Active chitosan-based film", "Bio-based film-forming solution", "Box\u2013Behnken experimental design methodology", "Chestnut wood extract", "Physico-mechanical properties", "Simultaneous model-based optimization"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086113985", "SubjectAreas": [["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"]], "AuthorData": {"57191985055": {"Name": "Baji\u0107 M.", "AuthorID": "57191985055", "AffiliationID": "60008358", "AffiliationName": "Department of Catalysis and Chemical Reaction Engineering, National Institute of Chemistry"}, "57210131345": {"Name": "Oberlintner A.", "AuthorID": "57210131345", "AffiliationID": "60008358", "AffiliationName": "Department of Catalysis and Chemical Reaction Engineering, National Institute of Chemistry"}, "57215043139": {"Name": "K\u00f5rge K.", "AuthorID": "57215043139", "AffiliationID": "60068861", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Biotechnology, Tallinn University of Technology"}, "15080792600": {"Name": "Likozar B.", "AuthorID": "15080792600", "AffiliationID": "60031106", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Technology, University of Ljubljana"}, "54949721600": {"Name": "Novak U.", "AuthorID": "54949721600", "AffiliationID": "60008358", "AffiliationName": "Department of Catalysis and Chemical Reaction Engineering, National Institute of Chemistry"}}}
