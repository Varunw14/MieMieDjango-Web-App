We focus on the pre-school period, an important life stage for the formation of trust and an age where war exposure may persist throughout life. We find robust evidence that individuals exposed to combats in the first six years of life display lower trust and social engagement well into adulthood. In light of the well-known relationship between trust and collective action, our results lend credence to the theory that violent conflict inhibits well-functioning government in long run.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Childhood experiences", "Conflict", "Social preferences", "Trust", "World War II"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072711915", "SubjectAreas": [["Finance", "ECON", "2003"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"36720294600": {"Name": "Conzo P.", "AuthorID": "36720294600", "AffiliationID": "122252526", "AffiliationName": "Collegio Carlo Alberto"}, "57191057859": {"Name": "Salustri F.", "AuthorID": "57191057859", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Health Economics Research Centre, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford"}}}
