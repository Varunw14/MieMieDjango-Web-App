The wealth of formats, methods, and technological solutions has led to increased availability and cost-effectiveness of clinical care, however, it has simultaneously generated a multitude of terms. With this paper, we first aim to establish whether a terminology issue exists in the field of Internet-delivered psychological interventions. If so, we aim to determine its implications for research, education, and practice. Furthermore, we intend to discuss solutions to mitigate the problem; in particular, we propose the concept of a common glossary. We invited 23 experts in the field of Internet-delivered interventions to respond to four questions, and employed the Delphi method to facilitate a discussion. We found that experts overwhelmingly agreed that there were terminological challenges, and that it had significant consequences for conducting research, treating patients, educating students, and informing the general public about Internet-delivered interventions. A cautious agreement has been reached that formulating a common glossary would be beneficial for the field to address the terminology issue. We end with recommendations for the possible formats of the glossary and means to disseminate it in a way that maximizes the probability of broad acceptance for a variety of stakeholders.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Consensus statement", "Digital health", "Internet", "Internet-delivered interventions", "Psychotherapy", "Terminology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086504302", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"55971350000": {"Name": "Smoktunowicz E.", "AuthorID": "55971350000", "AffiliationID": "60028378", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Stockholm University"}, "6603291354": {"Name": "Carlbring P.", "AuthorID": "6603291354", "AffiliationID": "60028378", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Stockholm University"}, "7102366025": {"Name": "Barak A.", "AuthorID": "7102366025", "AffiliationID": "60002999", "AffiliationName": "Department of Counseling and Human Development, University of Haifa"}, "7202645907": {"Name": "Andersson G.", "AuthorID": "7202645907", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet"}, "55933429800": {"Name": "Rozental A.", "AuthorID": "55933429800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, UCL"}, "7004230253": {"Name": "Banos R.M.", "AuthorID": "7004230253", "AffiliationID": "60001602", "AffiliationName": "CIBER Fisiopatologia Obesidad y Nutrici\u00f3n (CIBEROBN), Instituto Salud Carlos III"}, "7004121622": {"Name": "Botella C.", "AuthorID": "7004121622", "AffiliationID": "124583126", "AffiliationName": "Uiversitat Jaume I"}, "55169251100": {"Name": "Berger T.", "AuthorID": "55169251100", "AffiliationID": "60020486", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, University of Bern"}, "26032030100": {"Name": "Dear B.F.", "AuthorID": "26032030100", "AffiliationID": "60019544, 60088314", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Macquarie University"}, "57208160990": {"Name": "Titov N.", "AuthorID": "57208160990", "AffiliationID": "60019544, 60088314", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Macquarie University"}, "26021773600": {"Name": "Donker T.", "AuthorID": "26021773600", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Neuro and Developmental Psychology, Vrije Universiteit"}, "15925963800": {"Name": "Riper H.", "AuthorID": "15925963800", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Neuro and Developmental Psychology, Vrije Universiteit"}, "42061325600": {"Name": "Ebert D.D.", "AuthorID": "42061325600", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Behavioural and Movement Sciences, Clinical, Neuro- & Developmental Psychology, Vrije Universiteit"}, "7004056182": {"Name": "Hadjistavropoulos H.", "AuthorID": "7004056182", "AffiliationID": "60030101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Regina"}, "7006685175": {"Name": "Hodgins D.C.", "AuthorID": "7006685175", "AffiliationID": "60002306", "AffiliationName": "University of Calgary"}, "6506425962": {"Name": "Kaldo V.", "AuthorID": "6506425962", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Psychiatry Research, Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, & Stockholm Health Care Services"}, "55614489700": {"Name": "Mohr D.C.", "AuthorID": "55614489700", "AffiliationID": "60007363", "AffiliationName": "Center for Behavioral Intervention Technologies, Department of Preventive Medicine, Northwestern University"}, "35307724600": {"Name": "Nordgreen T.", "AuthorID": "35307724600", "AffiliationID": "60030280", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, Haukeland University Hospital"}, "7102483399": {"Name": "Powers M.B.", "AuthorID": "7102483399", "AffiliationID": "60031742", "AffiliationName": "Baylor University Medical Center"}, "6602698418": {"Name": "Ritterband L.M.", "AuthorID": "6602698418", "AffiliationID": "60030846, 60021918", "AffiliationName": "Center for Behavioral Health & Technology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurobehavioral Sciences, University of Virginia"}, "35491626800": {"Name": "Schueller S.M.", "AuthorID": "35491626800", "AffiliationID": "60007278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Science, University of California, Irvine"}, "56224653200": {"Name": "Weise C.", "AuthorID": "56224653200", "AffiliationID": "60012556", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Division of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, Philipps\u2013University of Marburg"}}}
