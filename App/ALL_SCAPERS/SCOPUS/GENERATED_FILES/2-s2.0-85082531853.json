In the X-linked meiotic drive system (SR) of a stalk-eyed fly, we found that SR males have greatly enlarged testes and maintain high fertility despite the destruction of half of their sperm, even when challenged with fertilizing large numbers of females. Conversely, we observed reduced allocation of resources to the accessory glands that probably explains the lower mating frequency of SR males. Body size and eye span were also reduced, which are likely to impair viability and precopulatory success. We discuss the potential evolutionary causes of these differences between drive and standard males.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Accessory gland", "Meiotic drive", "Multiple mating", "Sex ratio distorter", "Sexual selection", "Sperm competition", "Stalk-eyed fly", "Testis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Body Size", "Copulation", "Diptera", "Female", "Fertility", "Male", "Meiosis", "Sex Ratio", "Spermatozoa", "Testis", "X Chromosome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082531853", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"]], "AuthorData": {"57199404740": {"Name": "Meade L.", "AuthorID": "57199404740", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution, and Environment, University College London"}, "57210893364": {"Name": "Finnegan S.R.", "AuthorID": "57210893364", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution, and Environment, University College London"}, "57204775340": {"Name": "Kad R.", "AuthorID": "57204775340", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution, and Environment, University College London"}, "7103024394": {"Name": "Fowler K.", "AuthorID": "7103024394", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution, and Environment, University College London"}, "7006043549": {"Name": "Pomiankowski A.", "AuthorID": "7006043549", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "CoMPLEX, University College London"}}}
