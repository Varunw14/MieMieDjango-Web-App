With improvements in diagnostic and management practices, we have now updated the HCI with new data. METHODS: We evaluated nine aspects of health care in Cox proportional hazards models on time from TB diagnosis to death. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate the probability of death by HCI quartile. RESULTS: Of 1396 eligible individuals (72% male, 59% from Eastern Europe), 269 died within 12 months. Use of rifamycin/isoniazid/pyrazinamide-based treatment (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50\u20130.89), TB drug susceptibility testing (DST) and number of active TB drugs (DST \u00fe,3 drugs (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.80\u20131.48), DST \u00fe \u22653 drugs (HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.35\u20130.70) vs. no DST), recent HIV-RNA measurement (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.50\u20130.82) and combination antiretroviral therapy use (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53\u20130.97) were associated with mortality. These factors contributed respectively 5, \u20131, 8, 5 and 4 to the HCI. Lower HCI was associated with an increased probability of death; 30% (95% CI 26\u201335) vs. 9% (95% CI 6\u201313) in the lowest vs. the highest quartile. CONCLUSION: We found five potentially modifiable health care components that were associated with mortality among TB-HIV positive individuals. Validation of our HCI in other TB cohorts could enhance our findings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Health care index", "HIV", "TB"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095802544", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57200038020": {"Name": "Roen A.O.", "AuthorID": "57200038020", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL), Centre for Clinical Research, Epidemiology, Modelling and Evaluation (CREME), Institute for Global Health, UCL"}, "7006513758": {"Name": "Mocroft A.", "AuthorID": "7006513758", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL), Centre for Clinical Research, Epidemiology, Modelling and Evaluation (CREME), Institute for Global Health, UCL"}, "14322170800": {"Name": "Podlekareva D.", "AuthorID": "14322170800", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "CHIP, Department of Infectious Diseases, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "57214719138": {"Name": "Lundgren J.D.", "AuthorID": "57214719138", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "CHIP, Department of Infectious Diseases, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "7005723136": {"Name": "Kirk O.", "AuthorID": "7005723136", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "CHIP, Department of Infectious Diseases, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "55547118364": {"Name": "Miller R.F.", "AuthorID": "55547118364", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Clinical Research in Infection and Sexual Health, Institute for Global Health, UCL London"}, "7004024274": {"Name": "Panteleev A.", "AuthorID": "7004024274", "AffiliationID": "113335763", "AffiliationName": "Department of HIV/TB, TB Hospital 2"}, "57209061309": {"Name": "Skrahina A.", "AuthorID": "57209061309", "AffiliationID": "112863185", "AffiliationName": "The Republican Scientific and Practical Center for Pulmonology and TB"}, "7102494372": {"Name": "Miro J.M.", "AuthorID": "7102494372", "AffiliationID": "60001576, 60030315, 60010814", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Diseases Service, Hospital Clinic, August Pi i Sunyer Biomedical Research Institute, University of Barcelona"}, "55322441100": {"Name": "Cayla J.A.", "AuthorID": "55322441100", "AffiliationID": "60030315, 60085099", "AffiliationName": "Servicio de Epidemiolog\u00eda, Agencia de Salud P\u00fablica de Barcelona, CIBER Epidemiolog\u00eda y Salud P\u00fablica"}, "56642777200": {"Name": "Tetradov S.", "AuthorID": "56642777200", "AffiliationID": "60033150", "AffiliationName": "Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy"}, "57219861994": {"Name": "Derisova E.", "AuthorID": "57219861994", "AffiliationID": "101889135", "AffiliationName": "Botkin Infectious Disease Hospital"}, "57203665372": {"Name": "Furrer H.", "AuthorID": "57203665372", "AffiliationID": "60010987, 60020486", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern"}, "56785746500": {"Name": "Losso M.H.", "AuthorID": "56785746500", "AffiliationID": "60001846", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunocompromised, Hospital JM Ramos Mejia, Pabell\u00f3n de Clin\u00edca"}, "57194138824": {"Name": "Vassilenko A.", "AuthorID": "57194138824", "AffiliationID": "117996317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, City Clinical Hospital of Infectious Diseases"}, "57203678240": {"Name": "Girardi E.", "AuthorID": "57203678240", "AffiliationID": "60072494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Ospedale L Spallanzani, National Institute for Infectious Diseases"}, "57203678070": {"Name": "Post F.A.", "AuthorID": "57203678070", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
