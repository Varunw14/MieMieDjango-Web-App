Karger AG, Basel.Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the HLA haplotype frequencies and genetic profiles of the Kuwaiti population. Materials and Methods: Whole venous blood was obtained from 595 healthy, unrelated Kuwaiti volunteers. The study population was genotyped for HLA class I (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C) and class II (HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1) loci using sequence-specific oligonucleotide (SSO) probe-based hybridization and high-resolution HLA genotyping. Haplotype frequencies were estimated using an implementation of the expectation maximization algorithm that resolves both phase and allelic ambiguity. The Kuwaiti population was compared with other populations from the US National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP), by running a principal component analysis (PCA) on the relevant haplotype frequencies. Results: The most common HLA class I alleles in Kuwait were HLA-A\u221702:01g, HLA-C\u221706:02g, and HLA-B\u221750:01g with frequencies of 16, 14, and 12%, respectively. The most common HLA class II alleles in Kuwait were HLA-DQB1\u221702:01g and HLA-DRB1\u221707:01 with frequencies of 29.7 and 16.5%, respectively. The most common Kuwaiti haplotype observed was HLA-A\u221702:01g\u223cHLA-C\u221706:02g\u223cHLA-B\u221750:01g\u223cHLA-DRB1\u221707:01\u223cHLA-DQB1\u221702:01g at a frequency of 2.3%. The PCA demonstrated close genetic proximity of the Kuwaiti population with Middle Eastern, Southeast Asian, and North African populations in the NMDP. Conclusion: Identifying the haplotype diversity in the Kuwaiti population will contribute to the selection of an HLA-match for HSCT, disease associations, pharmacogenomics, and knowledge of pop-ulation HLA diversity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Genetic profile", "HLA haplotype frequency", "Human leukocyte antigen", "Kuwait"], "IndexKeywords": ["Genetic Profile", "Genetic Variation", "Haplotypes", "HLA Antigens", "Humans", "Kuwait"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078867783", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"56024889300": {"Name": "Ameen R.", "AuthorID": "56024889300", "AffiliationID": "60038812", "AffiliationName": "Medical Laboratory Department, Faculty of Allied Health, Health Sciences Center, Kuwait University"}, "6603046069": {"Name": "Al Shemmari S.H.", "AuthorID": "6603046069", "AffiliationID": "60038812", "AffiliationName": "Medicine Department, Health Sciences Center, Kuwait University"}, "55942654100": {"Name": "Marsh S.G.E.", "AuthorID": "55942654100", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60020641", "AffiliationName": "Anthony Nolan Research Institute, UCL Cancer Institute, Royal Free Campus"}}}
