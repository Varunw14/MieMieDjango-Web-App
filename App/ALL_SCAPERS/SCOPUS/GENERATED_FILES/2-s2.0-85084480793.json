In this study, we aimed to determine the protein expression and colocalisation of FRA1, c-Myc, Cyclin D1, and MMP7 in normal (NT), tumour (T), hyperplastic epidermis and/or squamous papilloma (Hyp/Pap), poorly-differentiated (PDSCC), or well-differentiated (WDSCC) EpSCC using a tissue array approach. Further objectives were to correlate protein expression to (i) levels of inflammation, using a convolutional neural network (ii) equine papillomavirus 2 (EcPV2) infection, detected using PCR amplification. We found an increase in expression of FRA1 in EpSCC compared to NT samples. c-Myc expression was higher in Hyp/Pap and WDSCC but not PDSCC whereas MMP7 was reduced in WDSCC compared with NT. There was a significant increase in the global intersection coefficient (GIC) of FRA1 with MMP7, c-Myc, and Cyclin D1 in EpSCC. Conversely, GIC for MMP7 with c-Myc was reduced in EpSCC tissue. Inflammation was positively associated with EcPV2 infection in both NT and EpSCC but not Hyp/Pap. Changes in protein expression could be correlated with EcPV2 for Cyclin D1 and c-Myc. Our results evaluate novel biomarkers of EpSCC and a putative correlation between the expression of biomarkers, EcPV2 infection and inflammation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Carcinoma, Squamous Cell", "Cyclin D1", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Horses", "Male", "Matrix Metalloproteinase 7", "Papillomaviridae", "Papillomavirus Infections", "Penile Neoplasms", "Protein Binding", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc", "ROC Curve", "Tissue Array Analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084480793", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57191540326": {"Name": "Arthurs C.", "AuthorID": "57191540326", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Prostate Cancer Research Centre at the Centre for Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, King\u2019s College London"}, "57216738698": {"Name": "Xie B.", "AuthorID": "57216738698", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Prostate Cancer Research Centre at the Centre for Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, King\u2019s College London"}, "57216755389": {"Name": "Machulla N.", "AuthorID": "57216755389", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Prostate Cancer Research Centre at the Centre for Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, King\u2019s College London"}, "57216742711": {"Name": "Cao K.", "AuthorID": "57216742711", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Prostate Cancer Research Centre at the Centre for Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, King\u2019s College London"}, "56904385200": {"Name": "Ahmed A.", "AuthorID": "56904385200", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Prostate Cancer Research Centre at the Centre for Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, King\u2019s College London"}, "25636181300": {"Name": "Suarez-Bonnet A.", "AuthorID": "25636181300", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathobiology and Population Sciences, Royal Veterinary College"}, "57204003880": {"Name": "Willis C.", "AuthorID": "57204003880", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathobiology and Population Sciences, Royal Veterinary College"}, "6508041786": {"Name": "Priestnall S.L.", "AuthorID": "6508041786", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathobiology and Population Sciences, Royal Veterinary College"}, "7005068471": {"Name": "Mair T.S.", "AuthorID": "7005068471", "AffiliationID": "60016144", "AffiliationName": "Bell Equine Veterinary Clinic"}, "15035543800": {"Name": "Millar M.", "AuthorID": "15035543800", "AffiliationID": "60010973, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Queen\u2019s Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh"}, "6602690023": {"Name": "Thrasivoulou C.", "AuthorID": "6602690023", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, The Centre for Cell and Molecular Dynamics, Rockefeller Building, University College London"}}}
