One in 10 women develops a surgical-site infection after cesarean section. The PREPS pilot trial was developed to assess the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial of vaginal cleansing with chlorhexidine before cesarean section, to reduce infectious morbidity. Material and methods: A multi-center, open-label, parallel-group pilot randomized controlled trial across 4 UK maternity units. Women aged \u226516 years, undergoing elective or emergency cesarean section, \u226534 weeks of gestation, and able to give informed consent were eligible. Women were randomized 1:1 to chlorhexidine 0.05% or no cleansing and were followed up until 6 weeks after cesarean section. The feasibility of a larger randomized controlled trial was assessed by the pilot trial\u2019s recruitment, ability to use verbal consent in an emergency, adherence, follow-up and withdrawal rates. The main clinical outcome collected was Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) classification of endometritis at 30 days. Trial registration number is ISRCTN33435996. Results: A total of 320 women (128% of target) were randomized. Of these, 93% (95% CI 89%-95%) received their allocated intervention. Of the 88 women who had an emergency cesarean section, verbal consent was initially given by 32 (36%) women, with the remainder having sufficient time to give written consent. Endometritis (CDC definition) was collected from medical notes of 96% of women, 68% (95% CI 63%-73%) were followed up at both 14 and 30 days by telephone, and we were able to collect patient-reported outcomes. In the vaginal cleansing arm 2/152 (1.3%) women had endometritis compared with 1/155 (0.7%) in the no cleansing arm (RR 2.08, 95% CI 0.19-22.31). Conclusions: It is possible to perform a randomized controlled trial in women undergoing an elective or emergency cesarean section, using a verbal-followed-by-written consent process, while maintaining high adherence and retaining women in the trial.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cesarean section", "chlorhexidine", "endometritis", "pilot projects", "sepsis", "surgical wound infection", "vaginal cleansing", "vaginal douching"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077163897", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"57204760804": {"Name": "Hodgetts-Morton V.", "AuthorID": "57204760804", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research, University of Birmingham"}, "57210124426": {"Name": "Farmer N.", "AuthorID": "57210124426", "AffiliationID": "60170285", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "16053411900": {"Name": "Morris R.K.", "AuthorID": "16053411900", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit, Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham"}, "55286710600": {"Name": "Hewitt C.A.", "AuthorID": "55286710600", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit, Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham"}, "39862481700": {"Name": "Wilson A.", "AuthorID": "39862481700", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit, Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham"}, "57212583179": {"Name": "Dixon E.", "AuthorID": "57212583179", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit, Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham"}, "56745864600": {"Name": "Brocklehurst P.", "AuthorID": "56745864600", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit, Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham"}, "35560730300": {"Name": "Hardy P.", "AuthorID": "35560730300", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit, Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham"}, "55489555300": {"Name": "Weckesser A.", "AuthorID": "55489555300", "AffiliationID": "60100434", "AffiliationName": "Center for Social Care, Health and Related Research, Faculty of Health, Education and Life Sciences, Birmingham City University, City South Campus"}}}
