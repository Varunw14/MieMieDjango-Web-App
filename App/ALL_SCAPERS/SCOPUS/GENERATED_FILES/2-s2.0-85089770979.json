The model is based upon ensemble or population dynamics that generate outcomes, like new cases and deaths over time. The purpose of this model is to quantify the uncertainty that attends predictions of relevant outcomes. By assuming suitable conditional dependencies, one can model the effects of interventions (e.g., social distancing) and differences among populations (e.g., herd immunity) to predict what might happen in different circumstances. Technically, this model leverages state-of-the-art variational (Bayesian) model inversion and comparison procedures, originally developed to characterise the responses of neuronal ensembles to perturbations. Here, this modelling is applied to epidemiological populations-to illustrate the kind of inferences that are supported and how the model per se can be optimised given timeseries data. Although the purpose of this paper is to describe a modelling protocol, the results illustrate some interesting perspectives on the current pandemic; for example, the nonlinear effects of herd immunity that speak to a self-organised mitigation process.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bayesian", "Compartmental models", "Coronavirus", "Dynamic causal modelling", "Epidemiology", "Variational"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089770979", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"25031569200": {"Name": "Razi A.", "AuthorID": "25031569200", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Turner Institute for Brain and Mental Health and Monash Biomedical Imaging, Monash University"}, "36080215500": {"Name": "Friston K.J.", "AuthorID": "36080215500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "57194038258": {"Name": "Parr T.", "AuthorID": "57194038258", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "38962379500": {"Name": "Zeidman P.", "AuthorID": "38962379500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "23099601700": {"Name": "Flandin G.", "AuthorID": "23099601700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "23995713600": {"Name": "Litvak V.", "AuthorID": "23995713600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "57201873636": {"Name": "Price C.J.", "AuthorID": "57201873636", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "54903227600": {"Name": "Lambert C.", "AuthorID": "54903227600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "21742214400": {"Name": "Daunizeau J.", "AuthorID": "21742214400", "AffiliationID": "60120341, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Institut du Cerveau et de la Moelle \u00e9pini\u00e8re, INSERM UMRS"}, "16229874600": {"Name": "Hulme O.J.", "AuthorID": "16229874600", "AffiliationID": "113459879", "AffiliationName": "London Mathematical Laboratory, Hammersmith"}, "55830349800": {"Name": "Billig A.J.", "AuthorID": "55830349800", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Ear Institute, University College London"}, "12345357400": {"Name": "Moran R.J.", "AuthorID": "12345357400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuroimaging Science, Department of Neuroimaging, IoPPN, King's College London"}}}
