Published by the American Physical Society.In contrast to bulk materials, nanoscale crystal growth is critically influenced by size- A nd shape-dependent properties. However, it is challenging to decipher how stoichiometry, in the realm of mixed-valence elements, can act to control physical properties, especially when complex bonding is implicated by short- A nd long-range ordering of structural defects. Here, solution-grown iron-oxide nanocrystals (NCs) of the pilot w\u00fcstite system are found to convert into iron-deficient rock-salt and ferro-spinel subdomains but attain a surprising tetragonally distorted local structure. Cationic vacancies within chemically uniform NCs are portrayed as the parameter to tweak the underlying properties. These lattice imperfections are shown to produce local exchange-anisotropy fields that reinforce the nanoparticles' magnetization and overcome the influence of finite-size effects. The concept of atomic-scale defect control in subcritical-size NCs aspires to become a pathway to tailor-made properties with improved performance for hyperthermia heating over defect-free NCs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Atomic-scale defects", "Exchange anisotropy", "Finite size effect", "Iron oxide nanocrystals", "Lattice imperfection", "Long range orders", "Nanoscale crystals", "Structural defect"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077441551", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55410872000": {"Name": "Lappas A.", "AuthorID": "55410872000", "AffiliationID": "60029857, 60019181", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Electronic Structure and Laser, Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas"}, "56019498700": {"Name": "Antonaropoulos G.", "AuthorID": "56019498700", "AffiliationID": "60001524", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Crete"}, "55961354400": {"Name": "Brintakis K.", "AuthorID": "55961354400", "AffiliationID": "60029857, 60019181", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Electronic Structure and Laser, Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas"}, "36188335000": {"Name": "Kostopoulou A.", "AuthorID": "36188335000", "AffiliationID": "60029857, 60019181", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Electronic Structure and Laser, Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas"}, "16508072100": {"Name": "Vasilakaki M.", "AuthorID": "16508072100", "AffiliationID": "60001104", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, National Center for Scientific Research Demokritos"}, "7004145955": {"Name": "Trohidou K.N.", "AuthorID": "7004145955", "AffiliationID": "60001104", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, National Center for Scientific Research Demokritos"}, "6603955113": {"Name": "Iannotti V.", "AuthorID": "6603955113", "AffiliationID": "60017293, 60110813", "AffiliationName": "CNR-SPIN, Department of Physics E.
