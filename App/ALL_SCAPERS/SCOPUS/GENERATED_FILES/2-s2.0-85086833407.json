Knowledge about the importance of epistemic trust and its determinants has been accumulating over the last few years, with important implications for psychotherapy and specific significance for the transition to VCP. The present paper provides a brief background on the concept of epistemic trust, research on the determinants of its development and the integrative framework it provides for some traditional concepts in psychotherapy, such as the therapeutic alliance. In particular, research on ostensive cuing, which requires significant modification in a remote delivery context, has important implications in the transition to VCP. We will advance some suggestions while illustrating the ideas with clinical case studies. This knowledge may be of value to psychotherapists, who are required to make substantial changes in the nature of the encounter with their patients, and may help them identify benefits and hindrances that might arise from this transition, as well as pointing out techniques that may encourage effective adaptation to the change.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Covid-19", "Epistemic trust", "ostensive cues", "video conferencing psychotherapy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086833407", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57217230654": {"Name": "Fisher S.", "AuthorID": "57217230654", "AffiliationID": "60002999", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Haifa"}, "57217231719": {"Name": "Guralnik T.", "AuthorID": "57217231719", "AffiliationID": "60002999", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Haifa"}, "37123226000": {"Name": "Zilcha-Mano S.", "AuthorID": "37123226000", "AffiliationID": "60002999", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Haifa"}, "57215570165": {"Name": "Fonagy P.", "AuthorID": "57215570165", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}}}
