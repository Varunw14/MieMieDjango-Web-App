Aim: This study sought to investigate the types and predictors of carer burden at first-episode psychosis in the largest, most ethnically diverse and comprehensively characterised sample to date. Method: This study involved a cross-sectional survey of carers of people with first-episode psychosis presenting to Harrow and Hillingdon Early Intervention in Psychosis service between 2011 and 2017. Carers completed self-report measures assessing their illness beliefs, coping styles and caregiving experiences (i.e. burden). Thirty carer and patient sociodemographic and clinical factors were also collected. Mixed effects linear regression modelling was conducted to account for clustering of carers by patient, with carer burden (and its 8 subtypes) investigated as dependent variables. Results: The sample included data on 254 carers (aged 18\u201374 years) and 198 patients (aged 14\u201336 years). Regression modelling identified 35 significant predictors of carer burden and its subtypes at first-episode psychosis. Higher total burden was independently predicted by perceiving greater negative consequences of the illness for the patient (B =.014, p <.001, 95% CI: [.010\u2013.018]) and the carer (B =.008, p =.002, 95% CI: [.003\u2013.013]), and engaging in avoidant-focussed coping (B =.010, p =.006, 95% CI: [.003\u2013.016]). Lower burden was independently predicted by patients being in a relationship (B = \u2212.075, p =.047, 95% CI: [\u2212.149 to \u2212.001]). Predictors of the eight burden subtypes (difficult behaviours, negative symptoms, stigma, problems with services, effects on family, dependency, loss and need to backup) are also included in the article. Conclusion: Findings can be used to inform the identification of carers \u2018at-risk\u2019 of experiencing burden and highlight potential targets for theraputic intervention to lower carer buden.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carer burden", "coping styles", "first-episode psychosis", "illness beliefs", "psychosis", "subjective burden"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086324593", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57217119925": {"Name": "Charles S.", "AuthorID": "57217119925", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "57218240440": {"Name": "Kirkbride J.B.", "AuthorID": "57218240440", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "57217105425": {"Name": "Lyons N.", "AuthorID": "57217105425", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "57217107326": {"Name": "Man L.C.", "AuthorID": "57217107326", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "57217102828": {"Name": "Floyd C.", "AuthorID": "57217102828", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "57217105806": {"Name": "Widuch K.", "AuthorID": "57217105806", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "57217108908": {"Name": "Brown L.", "AuthorID": "57217108908", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "56530198300": {"Name": "James G.", "AuthorID": "56530198300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "56530708200": {"Name": "Afsharzadegan R.", "AuthorID": "56530708200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "57200970420": {"Name": "Souray J.", "AuthorID": "57200970420", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "11838976200": {"Name": "Raune D.", "AuthorID": "11838976200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "6506669145": {"Name": "Onwumere J.", "AuthorID": "6506669145", "AffiliationID": "60162114", "AffiliationName": "Harrow and Hillingdon Early Intervention in Psychosis Service, Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
