All rights reserved.This article overviews the type of transmission utilized by central 5-HT-containing neurones, including synaptic, paracrine (volume) transmission and the 5-HT receptors subtypes involved in these processes. Central autonomic regulation has been chosen as the model system as consistent changes in neurophysiological and end organ endpoints can be measured during activation of fairly well defined central neuronal pathways (reflexes). Effects manipulations of the 5-HT system can be investigated on these evoked events thus determining the importance of 5-HT transmission in this system. Data focusing on parasympathetic and sympathetic regulation are considered, with additional reference to the sensory input.", "AuthorKeywords": ["5-HT receptors", "5-Hydroxtrypatmine", "Airway regulation", "Bladder", "Central cardiovascular regulation", "Gut", "Micturition", "Paracrine transmission", "Synaptic transmission", "Volume transmission"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079568286", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"7005352395": {"Name": "Ramage A.G.", "AuthorID": "7005352395", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
