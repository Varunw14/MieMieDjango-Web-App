All rights reserved.MicroRNA-31 (miR-31) is overexpressed in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), a deadly disease associated with dietary Zn deficiency and inflammation. In a Zn deficiency-promoted rat ESCC model with miR-31 up-regulation, cancer-associated inflammation, and a high ESCC burden following N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine (NMBA) exposure, systemic antimiR-31 delivery reduced ESCC incidence from 85 to 45% (P = 0.038) and miR-31 gene knockout abrogated development of ESCC (P = 1 \u00d7 10\u22126). Transcriptomics, genome sequencing, and metabolomics analyses in these Zn-deficient rats revealed the molecular basis of ESCC abrogation by miR-31 knockout. Our identification of EGLN3, a known negative regulator of nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB), as a direct target of miR-31 establishes a functional link between oncomiR-31, tumor suppressor target EGLN3, and up-regulated NF-\u03baB\u2013controlled inflammation signaling. Interaction among oncogenic miR-31, EGLN3 down-regulation, and inflammation was also documented in human ESCCs. miR-31 deletion resulted in suppression of miR-31\u2013associated EGLN3/NF-\u03baB\u2013controlled inflammatory pathways. ESCC-free, Zn-deficient miR-31\u2212/\u2212 rat esophagus displayed no genome instability and limited metabolic activity changes vs. the pronounced mutational burden and ESCC-associated metabolic changes of Zn-deficient wild-type rats. These results provide conclusive evidence that miR-31 expression is necessary for ESCC development.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Constitutive miR-31 knockout rat", "Esophageal cancer rat model", "Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma", "In vivo antimiR-31 delivery", "Zinc deficiency"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Carcinogens", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Dietary Supplements", "Esophageal Neoplasms", "Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma", "Esophagus", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Gene Knockout Techniques", "Humans", "Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-Proline Dioxygenases", "Male", "MicroRNAs", "Neoplasms, Experimental", "NF-kappa B", "Nitrosamines", "Rats", "Rats, Transgenic", "Signal Transduction", "Zinc"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081744649", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"7005621612": {"Name": "Fong L.Y.", "AuthorID": "7005621612", "AffiliationID": "60009189", "AffiliationName": "Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University"}, "57188646259": {"Name": "Jing R.", "AuthorID": "57188646259", "AffiliationID": "60015277", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Anatomy, and Cell Biology, Thomas Jefferson University"}, "7201468271": {"Name": "Farber J.L.", "AuthorID": "7201468271", "AffiliationID": "60015277", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Anatomy, and Cell Biology, Thomas Jefferson University"}, "15025456200": {"Name": "Smalley K.J.", "AuthorID": "15025456200", "AffiliationID": "60009189", "AffiliationName": "Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University"}, "16302702000": {"Name": "Taccioli C.", "AuthorID": "16302702000", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Animal Medicine, Production and Health, University of Padova"}, "7003620207": {"Name": "Palamarchuk A.", "AuthorID": "7003620207", "AffiliationID": "60002058, 60003500", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University"}, "7101976858": {"Name": "Huebner K.", "AuthorID": "7101976858", "AffiliationID": "60002058, 60003500", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University"}, "7202975031": {"Name": "Croce C.M.", "AuthorID": "7202975031", "AffiliationID": "60002058, 60003500", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University"}, "57200949577": {"Name": "Tagliazucchi G.M.", "AuthorID": "57200949577", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Genetics Institute, Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "57193161056": {"Name": "Fan S.", "AuthorID": "57193161056", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "NIH West Coast Metabolomics Center, UC Davis Genome Center, University of California"}, "57211726924": {"Name": "Fiehn O.", "AuthorID": "57211726924", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "NIH West Coast Metabolomics Center, UC Davis Genome Center, University of California"}, "55520704900": {"Name": "Altemus J.", "AuthorID": "55520704900", "AffiliationID": "60006297", "AffiliationName": "University Laboratory Animal Resources, University of Pennsylvania"}}}
