Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Landslides are a common natural hazard that causes casualties and unprecedented economic losses every year, especially in vulnerable developing countries. Considering the high cost of in-situ monitoring equipment and the sparse coverage of monitoring points, the Sentinel-1 images and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique were used to conduct landslide monitoring and analysis. The Muyubao landslide in the Three Gorges Reservoir area in China was taken as a case study. A total of 37 images from March 2016 to September 2017 were collected, and the displacement time series were extracted using the Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterer (StaMPS) small baselines subset method. The comparison to global positioning system monitoring results indicated that the InSAR processing of the Muyubao landslide was accurate and reliable. Combined with the field investigation, the deformation evolution and its response to triggering factors were analyzed. During this monitoring period, the creeping process of the Muyubao landslide showed obvious spatiotemporal deformation differences. The changes in the reservoir water level were the trigger of the Muyubao landslide, and its deformation mainly occurred during the fluctuation period and high-water level period of the reservoir.", "AuthorKeywords": ["InSAR", "Landslide deformation", "Reservoir water level", "Sentinel-1", "Three Gorges Reservoir area (China)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Displacement time series", "Field investigation", "In- situ monitoring", "Interferometric synthetic aperture radars", "Landslide monitoring", "Persistent scatterers", "Reservoir water level", "Three gorges reservoir area"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092900774", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"55976019600": {"Name": "Zhou C.", "AuthorID": "55976019600", "AffiliationID": "60001604", "AffiliationName": "Engineering Research Center of Rock-Soil Drilling & Excavation and Protection, Ministry of Education"}, "55577794600": {"Name": "Shi X.", "AuthorID": "55577794600", "AffiliationID": "60006019", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography and Information Engineering, China University of Geosciences"}, "55976717100": {"Name": "Cao Y.", "AuthorID": "55976717100", "AffiliationID": "60006019", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering, China University of Geosciences"}, "8905848100": {"Name": "Yin K.", "AuthorID": "8905848100", "AffiliationID": "60006019", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering, China University of Geosciences"}, "57204796345": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "57204796345", "AffiliationID": "60006019", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering, China University of Geosciences"}, "7003483555": {"Name": "Catani F.", "AuthorID": "7003483555", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Earth Science Department, School of Sciences, University of Florence"}, "55919919600": {"Name": "Ahmed B.", "AuthorID": "55919919600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction (IRDR), University College London (UCL)"}}}
