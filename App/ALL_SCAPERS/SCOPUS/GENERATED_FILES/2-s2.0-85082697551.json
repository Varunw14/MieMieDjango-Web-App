We employ a three-dimensional semiclassical model that fully accounts for electron and nuclear motion in strong fields. For different pairs of wavelengths, we compute the probabilities of the FDI pathways as a function of the ratio of the two field strengths. We identify a pathway of frustrated double ionization that is not present in strongly driven molecules with linear fields. In this pathway the first ionization step is \"frustrated\" and electronic correlation is essentially absent. This pathway is responsible for enhancing frustrated double ionization with CRTC fields. We also employ a simple model that predicts many of the main features of the probabilities of the FDI pathways as a function of the ratio of the two field strengths.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Counter rotating", "Double ionization", "Electronic correlation", "Field strengths", "Nuclear motions", "Semiclassical model", "Simple modeling", "Triatomic molecules"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082697551", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57205241380": {"Name": "Katsoulis G.P.", "AuthorID": "57205241380", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57216163113": {"Name": "Sarkar R.", "AuthorID": "57216163113", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "6603477664": {"Name": "Emmanouilidou A.", "AuthorID": "6603477664", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
