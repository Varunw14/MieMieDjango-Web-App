Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.Confirming a conjecture of Gy\u00e1rf\u00e1s, we prove that, for all natural numbers k and r, the vertices of every r-edge-colored complete k-uniform hypergraph can be partitioned into a bounded number (independent of the size of the hypergraph) of monochromatic tight cycles. We further prove that, for all natural numbers p and r, the vertices of every r-edge-colored complete graph can be partitioned into a bounded number of pth powers of cycles, settling a problem of Elekes, Soukup, Soukup, and Szentmikl\u00f3ssy [Discrete Math., 340 (2017), pp. 2053-2069]. In fact we prove a common generalization of both theorems which further extends these results to all host hypergraphs of bounded independence number.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bounded independence", "Complete graphs", "Hypergraph", "Natural number"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089852407", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"]], "AuthorData": {"57195276187": {"Name": "Bustamante S.", "AuthorID": "57195276187", "AffiliationID": "60012464", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda Matem\u00e1tica, Universidad de Chile"}, "57195275775": {"Name": "Corsten J.", "AuthorID": "57195275775", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "London School of Economics and Political Science"}, "57195281798": {"Name": "Frankl N.", "AuthorID": "57195281798", "AffiliationID": "60000308", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Combinatorial and Geometric Structures, MIPT"}, "6507195510": {"Name": "Skokan J.", "AuthorID": "6507195510", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "London School of Economics and Political Science"}, "37087562400": {"Name": "Pokrovskiy A.", "AuthorID": "37087562400", "AffiliationID": "60009016, 60033387", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, Mathematics, and Statistics, Birkbeck College, University of London"}}}
