The approach brings multimodal social semiotics into conversation with translanguaging to problematize the notion of languages as bounded systems, and to illustrate how emergent multilingual learners deploy their knowledge of the features of different language scripts and modalities to maximise their communicative capacity. We focus on the emergent translanguaging practices of Chinese immigrant children when using WeChat\u2014a popular Chinese social media that is widely used by young families in their everyday language and literacy practices. Reporting on a study of nine immigrant families in southeast London, we home in on one boy aged eight years and his younger brother aged six years, with mixed Chinese (mother) and Portuguese (father) immigrant heritage. Through fine-grained multimodal analysis of online exchanges between the older brother and contacts in their mother\u2019s WeChat network, we illustrate the multimodal, translinguistic and polyadic nature of his language use in practice and reflect briefly on the disjuncture between his home uses of multiple languages and his schooling. We also consider how the younger brother is socialised into translanguaging practices by observing and occasionally participating in his older sibling\u2019s online chat. The findings address a gap in research knowledge by illustrating how social media can enrich opportunities for young children\u2019s emergent translanguaging practices and heritage language learning.", "AuthorKeywords": ["immigrant families", "multilingual children", "multimodality", "Social media", "social semiotics", "translanguaging"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071725643", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"56156916300": {"Name": "Zhao S.", "AuthorID": "56156916300", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Linguistics & English Language, University of Edinburgh"}, "22833925100": {"Name": "Flewitt R.", "AuthorID": "22833925100", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
