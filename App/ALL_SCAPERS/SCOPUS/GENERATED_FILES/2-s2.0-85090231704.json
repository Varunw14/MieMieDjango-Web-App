There is potential for under and over-treatment if trial regimens are strictly adhered to in clinical practice where titrating dose to clinical response is recommended. Methods: We report the response to high-dose IVIg (>2 g/kg/6 weeks) in a subgroup of patients with definite CIDP or MMNCB who were unresponsive to \u2018usual\u2019 dosing. IVIg frequency and dosing was determined for each individual by subjective and objective outcome measures for impairment, grip strength, and activity and participation. Results: Six patients (three with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), three with MMN) were included. Two patients (one CIDP and one MMNCB) returned to full-time work on fractionated IVIg doses of 5 g/kg/month and 9 g/kg/month. Patient three (CIDP) failed numerous other immunosuppressants but responded to short-term fractionated 4 g/kg/month of IVIg. Patient four has severe, refractory, childhood-onset CIDP, remains stable but dependent currently on 6.9 g/kg/month of IVIg. Patients five and six, both with MMNCB, required short term 4.5\u20135 g/kg/month to recover significant bilateral hand strength. No IVIg-related adverse events occurred in any individual. Conclusions: These six cases demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of a treatment approach that includes individualised but evidence-based clinical assessment and, when necessary, high-doses of IVIg to restore patients\u2019 strength and ability to participate in activities of daily activities.
