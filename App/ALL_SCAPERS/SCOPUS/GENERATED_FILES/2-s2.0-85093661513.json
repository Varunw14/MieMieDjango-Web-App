Published by BMJ.Background: To describe 10-year trends in visual outcomes, anatomical outcomes and treatment burden of patients receiving antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). Methods: Retrospective cohort study of treatment-na\u00efve, first-affected eyes with nAMD started on ranibizumab before January 1, 2009. The primary outcome was time to best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) falling \u226435 ETDRS letters after initiating anti-VEGF therapy. Secondary outcomes included time to BCVA reaching \u226570 letters, proportion of eyes with BCVA \u226570 and \u226435 letters in 10 years, mean trend of BCVA and central retinal thickness over 10 years, and mean number of injections. Results: For our cohort of 103 patients, Kaplan-Meier analyses demonstrated median time to BCVA reaching \u226435 and \u226570 letters were 37.8 (95% CI 22.2 to 65.1) and 8.3 (95% CI 4.8 to 20.9) months after commencing anti-VEGF therapy, respectively. At the final follow-up, BCVA was \u226435 letters and \u226570 letters in 41.1% and 21%, respectively, in first-affected eyes, while this was the case for 5.4% and 48.2%, respectively, in a patient's better-seeing eye. Mean injection number was 37.0\u00b124.2 per eye and 53.6\u00b130.1 at patient level (63.1% of patients required injections in both eyes). Conclusions: The chronicity of nAMD disease and its management highlights the importance of long-term visual prognosis. Our analyses suggest that one in five patients will retain good vision (BCVA \u226570 ETDRS letters) in the first-affected eye at 10 years after starting anti-VEGF treatment; yet, one in two patients will have good vision in their better-seeing eye. Moreover, our data suggest that early treatment of nAMD is associated with better visual outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Choroid", "Degeneration", "Macula", "Retina", "Treatment Medical"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85093661513", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"57208736549": {"Name": "Arpa C.", "AuthorID": "57208736549", "AffiliationID": "60026556", "AffiliationName": "Ophthalmology Department, Fondazione Irccs Policlinico San Matteo"}, "57196260132": {"Name": "Khalid H.", "AuthorID": "57196260132", "AffiliationID": "60011568", "AffiliationName": "Ophthalmology Department, Tanta University"}, "57201365173": {"Name": "Chandra S.", "AuthorID": "57201365173", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital, Nhs Foundation Trust"}, "57209035230": {"Name": "Wagner S.", "AuthorID": "57209035230", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital, Nhs Foundation Trust"}, "56600218500": {"Name": "Faes L.", "AuthorID": "56600218500", "AffiliationID": "60033223", "AffiliationName": "Medical Retina, Cantonal Hospital Lucerne"}, "57197711348": {"Name": "Pooprasert P.", "AuthorID": "57197711348", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital, Nhs Foundation Trust"}, "55553202300": {"Name": "Chopra R.", "AuthorID": "55553202300", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital, Nhs Foundation Trust"}, "57202232830": {"Name": "Moraes G.", "AuthorID": "57202232830", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital, Nhs Foundation Trust"}, "35221042600": {"Name": "Balaskas K.", "AuthorID": "35221042600", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital, Nhs Foundation Trust"}, "24480921100": {"Name": "Keane P.A.", "AuthorID": "24480921100", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital, Nhs Foundation Trust"}, "35547907400": {"Name": "Sivaprasad S.", "AuthorID": "35547907400", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital, Nhs Foundation Trust"}, "57209181179": {"Name": "Fu D.J.", "AuthorID": "57209181179", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital, Nhs Foundation Trust"}, "57194024408": {"Name": "Fasler K.", "AuthorID": "57194024408", "AffiliationID": "60019619", "AffiliationName": "Zurich University Hospital, Department of Ophthalmology"}}}
