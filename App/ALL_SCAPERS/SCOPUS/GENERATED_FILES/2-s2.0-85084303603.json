In particular, data is an important element for occupant-centric design and operation as occupants\u2019 presence and actions are affected by a high degree of uncertainty and, hence, are hard to model in general. For such research, data handling is an important challenge, and following an open science paradigm based on open data can increase efficiency and transparency of scientific work. This article reviews current practices and infrastructure for open data-driven research on occupant-centric design and operation of buildings. In particular, it covers related work on open data in general and for the built environment in particular, presents survey results for existing scientific practices, reviews technical solutions for handling data and metadata, discusses ethics and privacy protection and analyses principles for the sharing of open data. In summary, this study establishes the status quo and presents an outlook on future work for methods and infrastructures to support the open data community within the built environment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anonymi", "ation", "Data publishing", "Data use", "FAIR Data", "Metadata schema", "Occupant behavior", "Ontology", "Open data", "z"], "IndexKeywords": ["Built environment", "Current practices", "Data and metadata", "Degree of uncertainty", "Design and operations", "Privacy protection", "Related works", "Technical solutions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084303603", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"]], "AuthorData": {"15044658500": {"Name": "Kj\u00e6rgaard M.B.", "AuthorID": "15044658500", "AffiliationID": "60019160", "AffiliationName": "SDU Software Engineering, University of Southern Denmark"}, "57136804200": {"Name": "Sangogboye F.C.", "AuthorID": "57136804200", "AffiliationID": "60019160", "AffiliationName": "SDU Software Engineering, University of Southern Denmark"}, "57202461094": {"Name": "Schwee J.H.", "AuthorID": "57202461094", "AffiliationID": "60019160", "AffiliationName": "SDU Software Engineering, University of Southern Denmark"}, "35242108200": {"Name": "Ardakanian O.", "AuthorID": "35242108200", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta"}, "55331189400": {"Name": "Carlucci S.", "AuthorID": "55331189400", "AffiliationID": "60013141", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Norwegian University of Science and Technology"}, "35368332400": {"Name": "Dong B.", "AuthorID": "35368332400", "AffiliationID": "60030551", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, College of Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University"}, "57196765409": {"Name": "Firth S.K.", "AuthorID": "57196765409", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, Building and Civil Engineering, Loughborough University"}, "57209599638": {"Name": "Gao N.", "AuthorID": "57209599638", "AffiliationID": "60011362", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science and Information Technology, School of Science, RMIT University"}, "55479822600": {"Name": "Rahaman M.S.", "AuthorID": "55479822600", "AffiliationID": "60011362", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science and Information Technology, School of Science, RMIT University"}, "7801420000": {"Name": "Salim F.D.", "AuthorID": "7801420000", "AffiliationID": "60011362", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science and Information Technology, School of Science, RMIT University"}, "55839916800": {"Name": "Huebner G.M.", "AuthorID": "55839916800", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Energy Institute, Bartlett School of Environment, Energy and Resources, University College London"}, "7006750113": {"Name": "Mahdavi A.", "AuthorID": "7006750113", "AffiliationID": "60018163", "AffiliationName": "Department of Building Physics and Building Ecology, Vienna University of Technology"}, "56067366800": {"Name": "Wolosiuk D.", "AuthorID": "56067366800", "AffiliationID": "60018163", "AffiliationName": "Department of Building Physics and Building Ecology, Vienna University of Technology"}, "57208037171": {"Name": "Zhu Y.", "AuthorID": "57208037171", "AffiliationID": "60007566", "AffiliationName": "Department of Construction Management, College of Engineering, Louisiana State University"}}}
