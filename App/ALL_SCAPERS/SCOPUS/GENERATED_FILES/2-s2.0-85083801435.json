Our objective was to study whether WML can be automatically segmented from CT images using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The second aim was to compare CT segmentation with MRI segmentation. Methods: The brain images from the Helsinki University Hospital clinical image archive were systematically screened to make CT-MRI image pairs. Selection criteria for the study were that both CT and MRI images were acquired within 6 weeks. In total, 147 image pairs were included. We used CNN to segment WML from CT images. Training and testing of CNN for CT was performed using 10-fold cross-validation, and the segmentation results were compared with the corresponding segmentations from MRI. Results: A Pearson correlation of 0.94 was obtained between the automatic WML volumes of MRI and CT segmentations. The average Dice similarity index validating the overlap between CT and FLAIR segmentations was 0.68 for the Fazekas 3 group. Conclusion: CNN-based segmentation of CT images may provide a means to evaluate the severity of WML and establish a link between CT WML patterns and the current standard MRI-based visual rating scale.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cerebral small vessel disease", "Computed tomography", "Convolutional neural network", "Machine learning", "White matter lesions"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083801435", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"56288621600": {"Name": "Pitk\u00e4nen J.", "AuthorID": "56288621600", "AffiliationID": "60016987, 60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital"}, "23980183900": {"Name": "Marinkovic I.", "AuthorID": "23980183900", "AffiliationID": "60016987, 60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital"}, "6506485992": {"Name": "Curtze S.", "AuthorID": "6506485992", "AffiliationID": "60016987, 60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital"}, "55363308000": {"Name": "Sibolt G.", "AuthorID": "55363308000", "AffiliationID": "60016987, 60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital"}, "35464245000": {"Name": "Jokinen H.", "AuthorID": "35464245000", "AffiliationID": "60002952, 60029080", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Logopedics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki"}, "55643278300": {"Name": "Erkinjuntti T.", "AuthorID": "55643278300", "AffiliationID": "60016987, 60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital"}, "24381877400": {"Name": "Melkas S.", "AuthorID": "24381877400", "AffiliationID": "60016987, 60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital"}, "6603098087": {"Name": "Koikkalainen J.", "AuthorID": "6603098087", "AffiliationID": "60159758, 60033191", "AffiliationName": "Combinostics Ltd., Tampere, Finland and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland"}, "57203162629": {"Name": "Nieminen T.", "AuthorID": "57203162629", "AffiliationID": "60159758, 60033191", "AffiliationName": "Combinostics Ltd., Tampere, Finland and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland"}, "8324761200": {"Name": "L\u00f6tj\u00f6nen J.", "AuthorID": "8324761200", "AffiliationID": "60159758, 60033191", "AffiliationName": "Combinostics Ltd., Tampere, Finland and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland"}, "57219777292": {"Name": "Rueckert D.", "AuthorID": "57219777292", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60116090", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Image Analysis Group, Department of Computing, Imperial College London"}, "7102989379": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "7102989379", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and University College London"}, "57212615213": {"Name": "Schmidt R.", "AuthorID": "57212615213", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center"}, "7004486153": {"Name": "Pantoni L.", "AuthorID": "7004486153", "AffiliationID": "60002200, 60030318", "AffiliationName": "L.
