The C2 spectrum is characterized by many band systems with new ones still being actively identified; astronomical observations involve eight of these bands. Recently, Furtenbacher et al. presented a set of 5699 empirical energy levels for 12C2, distributed among 11 electronic states and 98 vibronic bands, derived from 42 experimental studies and obtained using the MARVEL (Measured Active Rotational-Vibrational Energy Levels) procedure. Here, we add data from 13 new sources and update data from 5 sources. Many of these data sources characterize high-lying electronic states, including the newly detected 3 3\u03a0g state. Older studies have been included following improvements in the MARVEL procedure that allow their uncertainties to be estimated. These older works in particular determine levels in the C 1\u03a0g state, the upper state of the insufficiently characterized Deslandres-d'Azambuja (C 1\u03a0g-A 1\u03a0u) band. The new compilation considers a total of 31 323 transitions and derives 7047 empirical (marvel) energy levels spanning 20 electronic and 142 vibronic states. These new empirical energy levels are used here to update the 8states C2 ExoMol line list. This updated line list is highly suitable for high-resolution cross-correlation studies in astronomical spectroscopy of, for example, exoplanets, as 99.4 per cent of the transitions with intensities over 10-18 cm molecule-1 at 1000 K have frequencies determined by empirical energy levels.", "AuthorKeywords": ["astronomical data bases: miscellaneous", "comets: general", "molecular data", "opacity", "planets and satellites: Atmospheres", "stars: low-mass"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095497317", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"26423856700": {"Name": "McKemmish L.K.", "AuthorID": "26423856700", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of New South Wales"}, "57212507214": {"Name": "Syme A.M.", "AuthorID": "57212507214", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of New South Wales"}, "57201812219": {"Name": "Tennyson J.", "AuthorID": "57201812219", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of New South Wales"}, "7006170430": {"Name": "Csaszar A.G.", "AuthorID": "7006170430", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of New South Wales"}, "57204556729": {"Name": "Borsovszky J.", "AuthorID": "57204556729", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "35605893200": {"Name": "Yurchenko S.N.", "AuthorID": "35605893200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "10541128500": {"Name": "Furtenbacher T.", "AuthorID": "10541128500", "AffiliationID": "60025187, 60100914", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemistry, ELTE E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lorand University and MTA-ELTE Complex Chemical Systems Research Grou"}}}
