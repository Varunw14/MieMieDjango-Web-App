A key step in this process is estimating fiber orientation distribution (FOD), often done from a model such as constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD). Multi-shell (MS) multi-tissue CSD (M-CSD) provides a robust WM FOD by estimating the relative contribution to the dMRI signal from each tissue type (WM, grey matter, and cerebrospinal fluid), however, single-shell (SS) single tissue CSD (S-CSD) cannot independently estimate the signal contribution for each tissue type. S-CSD is therefore less accurate estimating FOD in voxels where multiple tissues are present. Due to that inaccuracy, tractography using S-CSD often generates more spurious WM streamlines compared to M-CSD. In this work, we present a framework to regress the M-CSD model coefficients from the S-CSD model coefficients using a convolutional neural network (CNN) in order to improve tractography. We construct a training dataset comprising acquired MS dMRI and paired synthetic SS dMRI, generated by selecting the outer shell from the MS dMRI. We select a High Resolution Network (HighResNet) as our choice of CNN to ensure subtle details of the CSD models are preserved during regression. The HighResNet is trained to perform patch-based regression from the S-CSD model coefficients and a co-registered T1-wieghted MR (T1) to the M-CSD model coefficients. We evaluate the method on patients with epilepsy who appeared structurally normal on T1. Four WM tracts related to language are extracted using a ROI-based probabilistic tractography. For comparison, M-CSD is as a pseudo ground truth. The original S-CSD generated tracts with Dice of 0.53\u20130.64, and the HighResNet regressed CSD models generated tracts with Dice of 0.73\u20130.77. We demonstrate HighResNet can regress M-CSD model coefficients from S-CSD model coefficients resulting in tracts more similar to the M-CSD generated tracts and with fewer spurious streamlines than S-CSD generated tracts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deep learning", "Diffusion weighted image", "Tractography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Fiber orientation distribution", "High resolution", "Model coefficient", "Probabilistic tractography", "Relative contribution", "Signal contribution", "Spherical deconvolution", "Training dataset"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095865838", "SubjectAreas": [["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Geometry and Topology", "MATH", "2608"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"57194789300": {"Name": "Lucena O.", "AuthorID": "57194789300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "57219298090": {"Name": "Sparks R.", "AuthorID": "57219298090", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "36931857600": {"Name": "Vos S.B.", "AuthorID": "36931857600", "AffiliationID": "60030943", "AffiliationName": "Epilepsy Society MRI Unit"}, "57215026527": {"Name": "Duncan J.", "AuthorID": "57215026527", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "54954062300": {"Name": "Vakharia V.", "AuthorID": "54954062300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, University College London"}}}
