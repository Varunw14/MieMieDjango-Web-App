We explore caregiver and community perceptions, and care-seeking experience, of childhood pneumonia, to understand contexts that drive pediatric service uptake in Nigeria. Methods: Community group discussions and qualitative interviews with caregivers in Lagos and Jigawa states were completed between 1 November 2018 and 31 May 2019. Participants were recruited from purposively sampled health facility catchment areas with assistance from facility staff. We used episodic interviews, asking caregivers (Jigawa = 20; Lagos = 15) to recount specific events linked to quests for therapy. Community group discussions (n = 3) used four vignettes from real pneumonia cases to frame a discussion around community priorities for healthcare and community-led activities to improve child survival. Data were analyzed using the framework method. Results: We found poor knowledge of pneumonia-specific symptoms and risk factors among caregivers and community members, with many attributing pneumonia to cold air exposure. Interviews highlighted that care-seeking decision making involved both husbands and wives, but men often made final decisions. In Lagos, older female relatives also shaped quests for therapy. Cost was a major consideration. In both states, there were accounts of dissatisfaction with health workers\u2019 attitudes and a general acceptance of vaccination services. Conclusion: There is a need for community-based approaches to improve caregiver knowledge and care seeking for under-five children with pneumonia. Messaging should attend to knowledge of symptoms, risk factors, family dynamics, and community responsibilities in healthcare service delivery and utilization.", "AuthorKeywords": ["caregivers", "community", "Nigeria", "pediatric", "pneumonia", "quests for therapy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Caregivers", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Delivery of Health Care", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Nigeria", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Pneumonia", "Qualitative Research", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078734515", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"55524273100": {"Name": "Bakare A.A.", "AuthorID": "55524273100", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Public Health, Karolinska Institute"}, "56238681300": {"Name": "King C.", "AuthorID": "56238681300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "57196316478": {"Name": "Graham H.", "AuthorID": "57196316478", "AffiliationID": "60018680", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, University College Hospital"}, "7004203991": {"Name": "Falade A.G.", "AuthorID": "7004203991", "AffiliationID": "60006270", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan"}, "57202332218": {"Name": "Agwai I.C.", "AuthorID": "57202332218", "AffiliationID": "60006270", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Faculty of Public Health, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan"}, "57214328078": {"Name": "Shittu F.", "AuthorID": "57214328078", "AffiliationID": "60006270", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Promotion and Education, Faculty of Public Health, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan"}, "16021435300": {"Name": "Colbourn T.", "AuthorID": "16021435300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "57214328862": {"Name": "Iuliano A.", "AuthorID": "57214328862", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "57191896778": {"Name": "Aranda Z.", "AuthorID": "57191896778", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "55369842400": {"Name": "Burgess R.A.", "AuthorID": "55369842400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "35756146700": {"Name": "McCollum E.D.", "AuthorID": "35756146700", "AffiliationID": "60001117", "AffiliationName": "Eudowood Division of Respiratory Sciences, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"}, "57214332111": {"Name": "Isah A.", "AuthorID": "57214332111", "AffiliationID": "60109245", "AffiliationName": "Save the Children International"}, "57214328120": {"Name": "Bahiru S.", "AuthorID": "57214328120", "AffiliationID": "60109245", "AffiliationName": "Save the Children International"}, "57214463264": {"Name": "Valentine P.", "AuthorID": "57214463264", "AffiliationID": "60109245", "AffiliationName": "Save the Children UK"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
