However, the measure\u2019s suitability for younger adolescents has recently been called into question by readability analysis. To provide further insight into the age-appropriateness of the self-report Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, readability was assessed at the item level alongside consideration of item quality criteria, its factor structure was analyzed, and measurement invariance between adolescents in Year 7 (age 11-12 years) versus Year 9 (age 13-15 years) was tested. The measure showed a wide range of reading ages, and the theorized factor structure was unacceptable. Measurement invariance was therefore considered for a flexible exploratory structural equation model, and no evidence of differences between age groups was found. Suggestions are made for the measure\u2019s revision based on these findings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adolescents", "exploratory structural equation modelling", "measurement invariance", "mental health", "readability", "Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079732042", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"]], "AuthorData": {"57206889809": {"Name": "Black L.", "AuthorID": "57206889809", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "University of Manchester"}, "57194704583": {"Name": "Mansfield R.", "AuthorID": "57194704583", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "University of Manchester"}, "56427872800": {"Name": "Panayiotou M.", "AuthorID": "56427872800", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "University of Manchester"}}}
