Objective To evaluate patients\u2019 knowledge about their oral anticoagulants and the potential role for community pharmacists in optimising safety. Setting Community pharmacies in England. Methods An online survey-based evaluation conducted over a 5-month period to ascertain patients\u2019 knowledge, use of anticoagulant alert cards, compliance with national monitoring requirements for warfarin, and frequency and nature of community pharmacist involvement in optimisation. Differences between patients on direct-acting oral anticoagulant agents and warfarin were assessed using Chi squared tests. Main outcome measure Patients\u2019 knowledge and use of anticoagulant alert cards. Results A total of 1515 pharmacies participated. Of 22,624 patients, 97% knew that they were taking anticoagulants; 20% had alert cards with them at time of dispensing; 17% had no card and 10% refuted their usefulness. Patients on warfarin were more aware of interactions with over-the-counter or herbal medicines than those on direct-acting oral anticoagulant agents. Of the patients on warfarin, 82% confirmed monitoring in the previous 12 weeks in accordance with national standards, with the international normalised ratio value known for 76%. Pharmacists intervened in a fifth of the patients to issue an alert card, contact the general practitioner for a change in the prescription or due to interacting medicines. Conclusion Patients had reasonable knowledge of their anticoagulation therapy, but areas for improvement were identified. Community pharmacists are well placed to optimise the safe use of anticoagulants.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anticoagulant alert card", "Community pharmacy practice", "Oral anticoagulant", "Patient knowledge", "Patient safety"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090299902", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacy", "HEAL", "3611"], ["Toxicology", "PHAR", "3005"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"6603352762": {"Name": "Jani Y.H.", "AuthorID": "6603352762", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "57218801979": {"Name": "Hirani B.", "AuthorID": "57218801979", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "57220430785": {"Name": "Livingstone C.", "AuthorID": "57220430785", "AffiliationID": "115285462", "AffiliationName": "NHS Specialist Pharmacy Service, Medicines Use and Safety"}}}
