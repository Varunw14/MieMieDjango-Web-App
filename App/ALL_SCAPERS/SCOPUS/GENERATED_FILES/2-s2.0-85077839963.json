Biological models of burst suppression are given as dynamical systems with slow and fast states. The aim of this paper is to give a method to identify parameters of a mesoscopic model of burst suppression that can provide insights into study underlying generators of intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) data. An optimisation technique based upon a genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to find feasible model parameters to replicate burst patterns in the iEEG data with paroxysmal transitions. Then, a continuous-discrete unscented Kalman filter (CD-UKF) is used to infer hidden states of the model and to enhance the identification results from the GA. The results show promise in finding the model parameters of a partially observed mesoscopic model of burst suppression.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biological models", "Burst suppression", "Continuous-discrete unscented kalman filters", "Mesoscopic modeling", "Neural mass models", "Neuronal activities", "Optimisation techniques", "Physiological recordings"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077839963", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"57209365153": {"Name": "Jafarian A.", "AuthorID": "57209365153", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Dept.
