As an exemplar interactive task, we use text-entry: a pervasive and highly complex interaction. We quantify data related to interaction combining systematic studies (i.e., error, speed, accuracy) and semi-structured workshops with experts (e.g., cognitive load, heuristics). We then formalize these factors in a mathematical model and use optimization algorithms (i.e. simulated annealing) to find an optimum gesture mapping. We demonstrated our method in a text-entry application (i.e., complex interactive dialogue) comparing our approach with other computationally determined mappings using naive cost functions. Our results showed that the designers mapping (with all factors weighted by designers) presented a good balance on performance in all factors involved (speed, accuracy, comfort, memorability, etc.), consistently performing better than purely computational mappings. The results indicate that our hybrid approach can yield better results than either pure user-driven methodologies or pure data-driven approaches, for our application context featuring a large solution space and complex high-level factors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Computational approaches", "Gestural interaction", "Optimization", "Semi-automated interaction design"], "IndexKeywords": ["Application contexts", "Computational approach", "Data-driven approach", "Gestural interaction", "High-level factors", "Interaction design", "Optimization algorithms", "Semi-automatic generation"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072861421", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57192186226": {"Name": "Montano-Murillo R.", "AuthorID": "57192186226", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics/Interact Lab, University of Sussex"}, "57215517228": {"Name": "Martinez-Plasencia D.", "AuthorID": "57215517228", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics/Interact Lab, University of Sussex"}, "35389893300": {"Name": "Subramanian S.", "AuthorID": "35389893300", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics/Interact Lab, University of Sussex"}, "37072348400": {"Name": "Han T.", "AuthorID": "37072348400", "AffiliationID": "60009697", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Manitoba"}, "6603711401": {"Name": "Irani P.", "AuthorID": "6603711401", "AffiliationID": "60009697", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Manitoba"}}}
