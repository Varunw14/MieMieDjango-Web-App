Both parasites are staggeringly prevalent, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas, and are associated with substantial morbidity. Infection is initiated by ingestion of infective eggs, which hatch in the intestine. Thereafter, T. trichiura larvae moult within intestinal epithelial cells, with adult worms embedded in a partially intracellular niche in the large intestine, whereas A. lumbricoides larvae penetrate the gut mucosa and migrate through the liver and lungs before returning to the lumen of the small intestine, where adult worms dwell. Both species elicit type 2 anti-parasite immunity. Diagnosis is typically based on clinical presentation (gastrointestinal symptoms and inflammation) and the detection of eggs or parasite DNA in the faeces. Prevention and treatment strategies rely on periodic mass drug administration (generally with albendazole or mebendazole) to at-risk populations and improvements in water, sanitation and hygiene. The effectiveness of drug treatment is very high for A. lumbricoides infections, whereas cure rates for T. trichiura infections are low. Novel anthelminthic drugs are needed, together with vaccine development and tools for diagnosis and assessment of parasite control in the field.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085634770", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"7003647297": {"Name": "Else K.J.", "AuthorID": "7003647297", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60111801", "AffiliationName": "Lydia Becker Institute for Immunology and Inflammation, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre"}, "7006845878": {"Name": "Grencis R.K.", "AuthorID": "7006845878", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60111801", "AffiliationName": "Lydia Becker Institute for Immunology and Inflammation, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre"}, "32867784000": {"Name": "Keiser J.", "AuthorID": "32867784000", "AffiliationID": "60023588", "AffiliationName": "University of Basel"}, "55539916200": {"Name": "Holland C.V.", "AuthorID": "55539916200", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Department of Zoology, School of Natural Sciences, Trinity College Dublin"}, "7006226532": {"Name": "Sattelle D.B.", "AuthorID": "7006226532", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Respiratory Biology, UCL Respiratory, Rayne Building, University College London"}, "9036129700": {"Name": "Fujiwara R.T.", "AuthorID": "9036129700", "AffiliationID": "60030074", "AffiliationName": "Department of Parasitology, Institute of Biological Sciences (ICB), Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"}, "10144490000": {"Name": "Bueno L.L.", "AuthorID": "10144490000", "AffiliationID": "60030074", "AffiliationName": "Department of Parasitology, Institute of Biological Sciences (ICB), Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"}, "6603776485": {"Name": "Asaolu S.O.", "AuthorID": "6603776485", "AffiliationID": "60011031", "AffiliationName": "Department of Zoology, Obafemi Awolowo University"}, "23036940300": {"Name": "Sowemimo O.A.", "AuthorID": "23036940300", "AffiliationID": "60011031", "AffiliationName": "Department of Zoology, Obafemi Awolowo University"}, "7402087724": {"Name": "Cooper P.J.", "AuthorID": "7402087724", "AffiliationID": "60109350", "AffiliationName": "Facultad de Ciencias Medicas, de la Salud y la Vida, Universidad Internacional del Ecuador"}}}
