Importantly, unlike solid-state physics, the common test bed for new ideas in topological physics, topological photonics provides an ideal platform to study wave mixing and other nonlinear interactions. These are well-known topics in classical nonlinear optics but largely unexplored in the context of topological photonics. Here, we investigate nonlinear interactions of one-way edge modes in frequency mixing processes in topological photonic crystals. We present a detailed analysis of the band topology of two-dimensional photonic crystals with hexagonal symmetry and demonstrate that nonlinear optical processes, such as second- and third-harmonic generation, can be conveniently implemented via one-way edge modes in this setup. Moreover, we demonstrate that more exotic phenomena, such as slow-light enhancement of nonlinear interactions and harmonic generation upon interaction of backward-propagating (left-handed) edge modes, can also be realized. Our work opens up new avenues towards topology-protected frequency mixing processes in photonics.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Hexagonal symmetry", "Light enhancement", "Light-matter interactions", "Mode interactions", "Nonlinear interactions", "Nonlinear optical process", "Second and third harmonics", "Two-dimensional photonic crystals"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084406846", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57216209901": {"Name": "Lan Z.", "AuthorID": "57216209901", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55487309400": {"Name": "You J.W.", "AuthorID": "55487309400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004097868": {"Name": "Panoiu N.C.", "AuthorID": "7004097868", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
