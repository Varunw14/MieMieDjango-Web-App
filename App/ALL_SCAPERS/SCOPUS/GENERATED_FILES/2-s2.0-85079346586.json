Chern number also identifies the topological properties of the photonic topological insulators (PTIs), thus it is of crucial importance in PTI design. In this paper, we develop a first principle computatioal method for the Chern number of 2D gyrotropic photonic crystals (PCs), starting from the Maxwell\u2019s equations. Firstly, we solve the Hermitian generalized eigenvalue equation reformulated from the Maxwell\u2019s equations by using the full-wave finite-difference frequency-domain (FDFD) method. Then the Chern number is obtained by calculating the integral of Berry curvature over the first Brillouin zone. Numerical examples of both transverse-electric (TE) and transverse-magnetic (TM) modes are demonstrated, where convergent Chern numbers can be obtained using rather coarse grids, thus validating the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Finite difference frequency domain methods", "First Brillouin zone", "First principle calculations", "Generalized eigenvalue equations", "Topological invariants", "Topological properties", "Transverse electrics", "Transverse magnetic modes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079346586", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"55429756600": {"Name": "Zhao R.", "AuthorID": "55429756600", "AffiliationID": "123781804", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Environmental Sensing, Department of Education of Anhui Province"}, "57193135010": {"Name": "Xie G.D.", "AuthorID": "57193135010", "AffiliationID": "123781804", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Environmental Sensing, Department of Education of Anhui Province"}, "12243904200": {"Name": "Huang Z.", "AuthorID": "12243904200", "AffiliationID": "123781804", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Environmental Sensing, Department of Education of Anhui Province"}, "57116687500": {"Name": "Chen M.L.N.", "AuthorID": "57116687500", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}, "57216209901": {"Name": "Lan Z.", "AuthorID": "57216209901", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56419475000": {"Name": "Sha W.E.I.", "AuthorID": "56419475000", "AffiliationID": "60003970", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Micro-nano Electronic Devices and Smart Systems of Zhejiang Province, College of Information Science Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University"}}}
