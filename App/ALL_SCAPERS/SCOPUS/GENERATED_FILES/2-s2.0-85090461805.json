CO2 mass transfer can be influenced strongly by the in-situ liberation of light oil components from live oil forming a distinct gas phase. This mechanism has been overlooked in the past for studying CO2 and oil interactions in tight formations. In this work, a series of analytical solutions and numerical simulations were developed to identify the effect on EOR by CO2 due to the liberation of a light hydrocarbon gas phase from live oil in shales. The analytical model demonstrated faster diffusion of CO2 in the two-phase system due to the presence of this gas phase. Using numerical approaches, laboratory-scale simulations indicated that in-situ gas formation can increase oil recovery by 35%. At the field-scale, an additional oil recovery of 9.8% could be attained. Also, the CO2 storage capacity of shale formations could be significantly enhanced due to capillary trapping of CO2 in the liberated gas. The results of this study could potentially be used to improve evaluations of the potential of CO2 EOR in shale reservoirs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CO2 injection", "CO2 storage", "Enhanced oil recovery", "huff-n-puff", "phase behavior", "shale oil", "simulation", "unconventionals"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carbon dioxide injection", "Enhanced oil recovery", "Light hydrocarbon", "Numerical approaches", "Oil recoveries", "Shale formation", "Tight formation", "Two phase systems"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090461805", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Nuclear Energy and Engineering", "ENER", "2104"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"]], "AuthorData": {"56316281400": {"Name": "Mahzari P.", "AuthorID": "56316281400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "57194246995": {"Name": "Jones A.P.", "AuthorID": "57194246995", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "57195018773": {"Name": "Oelkers E.H.", "AuthorID": "57195018773", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}}}
