However, it is unclear whether these inequalities differ across time, nor if they are consistent across different SEP indicators. Methods British birth cohorts born in 1946, 1958 and 1970 were used, and multiple SEP indicators in early and adult life were examined. Deaths were identified via national statistics or notifications. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate associations between ridit scored SEP indicators and all-cause mortality risk - from 26 to 43 years (n=40 784), 26 to 58 years (n=35 431) and 26 to 70 years (n=5353). Results More disadvantaged SEP was associated with higher mortality risk - magnitudes of association were similar across cohort and each SEP indicator. For example, HRs (95% CI) from 26 to 43 years comparing lowest to highest paternal social class were 2.74 (1.02 to 7.32) in 1946c, 1.66 (1.03 to 2.69) in 1958c, and 1.94 (1.20 to 3.15) in 1970c. Paternal social class, adult social class and housing tenure were each independently associated with mortality risk. Conclusions Socioeconomic circumstances in early and adult life show persisting associations with premature mortality from 1971 to 2016, reaffirming the need to address socioeconomic factors across life to reduce inequalities in survival to older age.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Inequalities", "Mortality", "Socio-economic"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092784571", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"56392959200": {"Name": "Fluharty M.E.", "AuthorID": "56392959200", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Ucl Institute of Education, Centre for Longitudinal Studies"}, "14020124700": {"Name": "Ploubidis G.", "AuthorID": "14020124700", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Ucl Institute of Education, Centre for Longitudinal Studies"}, "55790281500": {"Name": "Bann D.", "AuthorID": "55790281500", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Ucl Institute of Education, Centre for Longitudinal Studies"}, "57204025615": {"Name": "Hardy R.", "AuthorID": "57204025615", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Ucl Institute of Education, Cohort and Longitudinal Studies Enhancement Resources"}, "56747964600": {"Name": "Pongiglione B.", "AuthorID": "56747964600", "AffiliationID": "60021796", "AffiliationName": "Bocconi University, Centre for Research on Health and Social Care Management"}}}
