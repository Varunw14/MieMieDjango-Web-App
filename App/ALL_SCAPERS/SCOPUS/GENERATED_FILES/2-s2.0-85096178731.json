Study 1 investigated these outcomes for 43 girls and 38 boys, aged 4 to 11 years, with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH, a genetic condition causing increased adrenal androgen production beginning prenatally) compared to similarly-aged, unaffected relatives (41 girls, 31 boys). The predicted sex differences were found for all of the outcome measures. Furthermore, girls with CAH showed increased male-typical and decreased female-typical behavior and toy and playmate preferences compared to unaffected girls. Study 2 investigated the relationship of amniotic fluid testosterone to gender-typed behavior and toy and playmate preferences in typically developing children (48 girls, 44 boys) aged 3 to 5 years. Although the predicted sex differences were found for all of the outcome measures, amniotic fluid testosterone was not a significant correlate, in the predicted direction, of any outcome measure for either sex. The results of study 1 provide additional support for an influence of prenatal androgen exposure on children's gender-typed behavior, including toy and playmate preferences. The results of study 2 do not, but amniotic fluid testosterone may be an insufficiently sensitive measure of early androgen exposure. A more sensitive and reliable measure of prenatal androgen exposure may be needed to consistently detect relations to later gender typed behavior in non-clinical populations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amniotic fluid testosterone", "Androgen", "Congenital adrenal hyperplasia", "Gender-typed play behavior", "Playmate preferences", "Prenatal testosterone exposure", "Sex differences", "Toy preferences"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096178731", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"], ["Endocrine and Autonomic Systems", "NEUR", "2807"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"56402553900": {"Name": "Spencer D.", "AuthorID": "56402553900", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Cambridge"}, "8108722800": {"Name": "Pasterski V.", "AuthorID": "8108722800", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60017488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, University of Cambridge, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "56402957700": {"Name": "Neufeld S.A.S.", "AuthorID": "56402957700", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Cambridge"}, "7102576790": {"Name": "Hines M.", "AuthorID": "7102576790", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Cambridge"}, "7101770591": {"Name": "Glover V.", "AuthorID": "7101770591", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology, Imperial College London"}, "7402142375": {"Name": "O'Connor T.G.", "AuthorID": "7402142375", "AffiliationID": "60012831, 60024746", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Rochester Medical Center"}, "57203616076": {"Name": "Hindmarsh P.C.", "AuthorID": "57203616076", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "56365856800": {"Name": "Hughes I.A.", "AuthorID": "56365856800", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60017488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, University of Cambridge, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "6701333811": {"Name": "Acerini C.L.", "AuthorID": "6701333811", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60017488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, University of Cambridge, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}}}
