In this work, an abrupt change in acoustic regime is observed during operation of a PEMWE as the current density is increased from 0.5 to 1.0 A cm\u22122. This regime change is marked by a sudden drop in the number of acoustic hits, while hit duration, amplitude, and energy increase significantly. It is found that the change in acoustic regime coincides with a significant extension of the stagnant bubble region in the flow channels of the PEMWE, observed with high-speed optical imaging. These results demonstrate that acoustic emission can be used effectively as an operando diagnostic tool to monitor bubble formation (two-phase flow conditions) in PEMWEs, facilitating rapid testing or prototyping, and contributing to operational safety.", "AuthorKeywords": ["acoustic emission", "flow channels", "flow regime", "gas bubble", "mass transport", "operando diagnostics", "polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolyser"], "IndexKeywords": ["Diagnostic tools", "Electrochemical energy conversions", "Energy increase", "Non destructive", "Operational safety", "Optical imaging", "Polymer electrolyte membranes", "Water electrolyser"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094974634", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"57201278292": {"Name": "Maier M.", "AuthorID": "57201278292", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, UCL"}, "57195986377": {"Name": "Majasan J.", "AuthorID": "57195986377", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, UCL"}, "55778639400": {"Name": "Owen R.E.", "AuthorID": "55778639400", "AffiliationID": "60172680", "AffiliationName": "The Faraday Institution, Quad One, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "55869997100": {"Name": "Robinson J.B.", "AuthorID": "55869997100", "AffiliationID": "60172680", "AffiliationName": "The Faraday Institution, Quad One, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "56487982500": {"Name": "Dodwell J.", "AuthorID": "56487982500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, UCL"}, "57203174305": {"Name": "Wu Y.", "AuthorID": "57203174305", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, UCL"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.R.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60172680", "AffiliationName": "The Faraday Institution, Quad One, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.J.L.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60172680", "AffiliationName": "The Faraday Institution, Quad One, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "57202240331": {"Name": "Meyer Q.", "AuthorID": "57202240331", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, UNSW"}, "55556957100": {"Name": "Castanheira L.", "AuthorID": "55556957100", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}, "56140429400": {"Name": "Hinds G.", "AuthorID": "56140429400", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}}}
