International Journal of Robust and Nonlinear Control published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.This article addresses the problem of distributed secondary voltage control of an islanded microgrid (MG) from a cyber-physical perspective. An event-triggered distributed model predictive control (DMPC) scheme is designed to regulate the voltage magnitude of each distributed generators (DGs) in order to achieve a better trade-off between the control performance and communication and computation burdens. By using two novel event triggering conditions that can be easily embedded into the DMPC for the application of MG control, the computation and communication burdens are significantly reduced with negligible compromise of control performance. In addition, to reduce the sensor cost and to eliminate the negative effects of nonlinearity, an adaptive nonasymptotic observer is utilized to estimate the internal and output signals of each DG. Thanks to the deadbeat observation property, the observer can be applied periodically to cooperate with the DMPC-based voltage regulator. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control method has been tested on a simple configuration with four DGs and the modified IEEE-13 test system through several representative scenarios.", "AuthorKeywords": ["distributed model predictive control", "event-triggered control", "microgrid", "nonasymptotic observer", "resilience"], "IndexKeywords": ["Computation burden", "Control performance", "Distributed generator (DGs)", "Distributed Model predictive Control", "Event-triggering", "Islanded microgrid", "Secondary voltage control", "Voltage magnitude"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091285476", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Aerospace Engineering", "ENGI", "2202"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57201446561": {"Name": "Ge P.", "AuthorID": "57201446561", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "57204629999": {"Name": "Teng F.", "AuthorID": "57204629999", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "56021899900": {"Name": "Chen B.", "AuthorID": "56021899900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
