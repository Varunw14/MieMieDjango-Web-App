While the preferential exclusion effects of excipients are well known, the additional presence and impact of specific protein-excipient interactions have proven to be more elusive to identify and characterize. We have taken a combined approach of in silico molecular docking and hydrogen deuterium exchange-mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to characterize the interactions between granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and some common excipients. These interactions were related to their influence on the thermal-melting temperatures (Tm) for the nonreversible unfolding of G-CSF in liquid formulations. The residue-level interaction sites predicted in silico correlated well with those identified experimentally and highlighted the potential impact of specific excipient interactions on the Tm of G-CSF.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aggregation", "excipient", "formulation", "prediction", "stability"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095830437", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"57219872919": {"Name": "Wood V.E.", "AuthorID": "57219872919", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "6701589883": {"Name": "Dalby P.A.", "AuthorID": "6701589883", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56245252500": {"Name": "Groves K.", "AuthorID": "56245252500", "AffiliationID": "60005889", "AffiliationName": "National Measurement Laboratory, LGC Ltd."}, "55559403100": {"Name": "Cryar A.", "AuthorID": "55559403100", "AffiliationID": "60005889", "AffiliationName": "National Measurement Laboratory, LGC Ltd."}, "36917373400": {"Name": "Quaglia M.", "AuthorID": "36917373400", "AffiliationID": "60005889", "AffiliationName": "National Measurement Laboratory, LGC Ltd."}, "6602448229": {"Name": "Matejtschuk P.", "AuthorID": "6602448229", "AffiliationID": "60000365", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Biological Standards and Control"}}}
