It argues that besides environmental forces and managerial rationality, the organisational dimension needs to be accounted for. Addressing the mixed empirical evidence in the relevant literature, we conceptualise the organisational dimension as a meso-level intervening variable mediating both external influences (outside-inside) and organisational action (inside-outside). We operationalise the organisational dimension along three components: organisational structure, identity and centrality, which are further elaborated in sub-components and indicators. A set of hypotheses to be tested in empirical research is provided. The paper offers new perspectives on the dynamics of change in higher education and on strategic agency of organisational actors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Determinism", "Higher education", "Institutionalism", "Intentionality", "Organisational actorhood", "Strategic positioning"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076514687", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"35772284300": {"Name": "Fumasoli T.", "AuthorID": "35772284300", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "57192806343": {"Name": "Barbato G.", "AuthorID": "57192806343", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, Management and Quantitative Methods, Universit\u00e0 degli studi di Milano"}, "7004614949": {"Name": "Turri M.", "AuthorID": "7004614949", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, Management and Quantitative Methods, Universit\u00e0 degli studi di Milano"}}}
