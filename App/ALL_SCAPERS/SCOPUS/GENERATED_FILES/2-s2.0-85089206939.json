Here, we test the viability and robustness of BFSD-EIT in stroke diagnosis. Methods: A realistic 4-layer Finite Element Method (FEM) head model with and without bleed and clot lesions is developed. Performance is assessed with test parameters including: measurement noise, electrode placement errors, contact impedance errors, deviations in assumed tissue conductivity, deviations in assumed anatomy, and a frequency-dependent background. A final test is performed using ischemic patient data. Results are assessed using images and quantitative metrics. Results: BFSD-EIT may be feasible for stroke diagnosis if a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of \u226560 dB is achievable. Sensitivity to errors in electrode positioning is seen with a tolerance of only \u00b15 mm, but a tolerance of up to \u00b130 mm is possible if symmetry is maintained between symmetrically opposite partner electrodes. The technique is robust to errors in contact impedance and assumed tissue conductivity up to at least \u00b150%. Asymmetric internal anatomy affects performance but may be tolerable for tissues with frequency-dependent conductivity. Errors in assumed external geometry marginally affect performance. A frequency-dependent background does not affect performance with carefully chosen frequency points or use of multiple frequency points across a band. The Global Left-Hand Side (LHS) & Right-Hand Side (RHS) Mean Intensity metric is particularly robust to errors. Conclusion: BFSD-EIT is a promising technique for stroke diagnosis, provided parameters are within the tolerated ranges. Significance: BFSD-EIT may prove an important step forward in imaging of static scenes such as stroke.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electrical impedance tomography", "reconstruction algorithm", "stroke imaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electrode placement", "Electrode positioning", "Frequency dependent", "Frequency dependent conductivity", "Multiple frequency", "Quantitative metrics", "Sensitivity to errors", "Tissue conductivity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089206939", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Health Information Management", "HEAL", "3605"]], "AuthorData": {"57197771651": {"Name": "McDermott B.", "AuthorID": "57197771651", "AffiliationID": "60008539", "AffiliationName": "Translational Medical Device Lab, National University of Ireland Galway"}, "15846128900": {"Name": "O'Halloran M.", "AuthorID": "15846128900", "AffiliationID": "60008539", "AffiliationName": "Translational Medical Device Lab, National University of Ireland Galway"}, "35090450400": {"Name": "Porter E.", "AuthorID": "35090450400", "AffiliationID": "60008539", "AffiliationName": "Translational Medical Device Lab, National University of Ireland Galway"}, "56673693400": {"Name": "Avery J.", "AuthorID": "56673693400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}}}
