Particularly when the lifetimes of these states approach the millisecond timescale, identifying the relevant structures and the mechanism by which they interconvert remains a tremendous challenge. Here we introduce a novel combination of accelerated MD (aMD) simulations and Markov state modelling (MSM) to explore these 'excited' conformational states. Applying this to the highly dynamic protein CypA, a protein involved in immune response and associated with HIV infection, we identify five principally populated conformational states and the atomistic mechanism by which they interconvert. A rational design strategy predicted that the mutant D66A should stabilise the minor conformations and substantially alter the dynamics, whereas the similar mutant H70A should leave the landscape broadly unchanged. These predictions are confirmed using CPMG and R1\u03c1 solution state NMR measurements. By efficiently exploring functionally relevant, but sparsely populated conformations with millisecond lifetimes in silico, our aMD/MSM method has tremendous promise for the design of dynamic protein free energy landscapes for both protein engineering and drug discovery.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Atomistic mechanism", "Conformational state", "Dynamic proteins", "Energy landscape", "Immune response", "Protein engineering", "Rational design", "Solution state NMR"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081788034", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"54079713600": {"Name": "Ju\u00e1rez-Jim\u00e9nez J.", "AuthorID": "54079713600", "AffiliationID": "60027272, 60181355", "AffiliationName": "EaStCHEM School of Chemistry, University of Edinburgh David"}, "57203191974": {"Name": "Gupta A.A.", "AuthorID": "57203191974", "AffiliationID": "60027272, 60181355", "AffiliationName": "EaStCHEM School of Chemistry, University of Edinburgh David"}, "54883902500": {"Name": "Mey A.S.J.S.", "AuthorID": "54883902500", "AffiliationID": "60027272, 60181355", "AffiliationName": "EaStCHEM School of Chemistry, University of Edinburgh David"}, "57195063971": {"Name": "Georgiou C.", "AuthorID": "57195063971", "AffiliationID": "60027272, 60181355", "AffiliationName": "EaStCHEM School of Chemistry, University of Edinburgh David"}, "56819019500": {"Name": "Ioannidis H.", "AuthorID": "56819019500", "AffiliationID": "60027272, 60181355", "AffiliationName": "EaStCHEM School of Chemistry, University of Edinburgh David"}, "54390957300": {"Name": "De Simone A.", "AuthorID": "54390957300", "AffiliationID": "60027272, 60181355", "AffiliationName": "EaStCHEM School of Chemistry, University of Edinburgh David"}, "7103050396": {"Name": "Barlow P.N.", "AuthorID": "7103050396", "AffiliationID": "60027272, 60181355", "AffiliationName": "EaStCHEM School of Chemistry, University of Edinburgh David"}, "7003726395": {"Name": "Hulme A.N.", "AuthorID": "7003726395", "AffiliationID": "60027272, 60181355", "AffiliationName": "EaStCHEM School of Chemistry, University of Edinburgh David"}, "15520146800": {"Name": "Michel J.", "AuthorID": "15520146800", "AffiliationID": "60027272, 60181355", "AffiliationName": "EaStCHEM School of Chemistry, University of Edinburgh David"}, "57189592844": {"Name": "Karunanithy G.", "AuthorID": "57189592844", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory, University of Oxford South"}, "12753648200": {"Name": "Baldwin A.J.", "AuthorID": "12753648200", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory, University of Oxford South"}, "7005817000": {"Name": "Walkinshaw M.D.", "AuthorID": "7005817000", "AffiliationID": "118781749", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences Michael Swann Building, Max Born Crescent"}}}
