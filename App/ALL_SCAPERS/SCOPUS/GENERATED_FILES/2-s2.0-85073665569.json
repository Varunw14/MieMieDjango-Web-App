Both types of movements are within the range of normal movement kinematics and muscle synergies, but appear repetitive and without appropriate context embedment. Historically, there have been many attempts to separate the 2 types of movements, but because of their phenomenological overlap, clinical distinction may be prone to error, and misdiagnoses may often occur. Most importantly, the 2 types of movement may coexist. Here, we review the available literature on the 2 types of motor phenomena and demonstrate some of the difficulties in distinguishing tics from functional tic-like movements on clinical grounds. We also highlight similarities and differences in pathophysiologic characteristics, documenting the significance of action monitoring, attentional allocation, and behavioral reinforcement in both types of movements, as well as in their risk factors. We discuss the overlap of current behavioral treatments for tics and functional tic-like movements and emphasize implications of diagnostic mislabeling. Such implications include the need to tailor behavioral treatment approaches to individual phenomenological profiles and guiding decision making for severe patients requiring invasive interventions, such as deep brain stimulation. A deeper insight from clinicians with respect to persisting challenges in classifying and differentiating these motor phenomena could accelerate the development of reliable clinical and physiologic markers (i.e., next generation phenotyping) and a neurobiology-driven therapeutic approach for these motor phenomena.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Humans", "Tic Disorders", "Tics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073665569", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"37101265800": {"Name": "Ganos C.", "AuthorID": "37101265800", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Charit\u00e9 University Medicine Berlin"}, "7003948139": {"Name": "Martino D.", "AuthorID": "7003948139", "AffiliationID": "60192954, 60002306, 60000953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Hotchkiss Brain Institute"}, "6507630454": {"Name": "Espay A.J.", "AuthorID": "6507630454", "AffiliationID": "60025152", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, James J. and Joan A.
