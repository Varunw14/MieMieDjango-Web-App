However, the specific cognitive mechanisms by which being watched triggers these changes are poorly understood. Here we test the hypothesis that these changes happen because the belief in being watched increases self-referential processing. We used a novel deceptive video-conference paradigm, where participants believe a video-clip is (or is not) a live feed of a confederate watching them. Participants completed four tasks measuring self-referential processing, prosocial behaviour and self-awareness under these two belief settings. Although the belief manipulation and self-referential effect task were effective, there were no changes on self-referential processing between the two settings, nor on prosocial behaviour and self-awareness. Based on previous evidence and these findings, we propose that further research on the role of the self, social context and personality traits will help elucidating the mechanisms underlying audience effects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Audience effect", "Being watched", "Reputation management", "Self-referential processing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Awareness", "Female", "Humans", "Interpersonal Relations", "Male", "Self Concept", "Social Behavior", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075815036", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"57204121640": {"Name": "Ca\u00f1igueral R.", "AuthorID": "57204121640", "AffiliationID": "60109771", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, Alexandra House"}, "38060964400": {"Name": "Hamilton A.F.d.C.", "AuthorID": "38060964400", "AffiliationID": "60109771", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, Alexandra House"}}}
