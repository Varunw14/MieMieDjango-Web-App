No relevant studies which have assessed research priorities in healthcare-associated infection (HCAI) that have involved patients' and carers' opinions were identified in the literature. Aim: The Healthcare-Associated Infections Priority Setting Partnership was established to identify the top research priorities in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of HCAI in the UK, considering the opinions of all these groups. Methods: The methods broadly followed the principles of the James Lind Alliance (JLA) priority setting activity. Findings: In total, 259 unique valid research questions were identified from 221 valid responses to a consultation of patients, carers and healthcare professionals after seeking their opinions for research priorities. The steering committee of the priority setting partnership rationalized these to 50 unique questions. A literature review established that for these questions there were no recent high-quality systematic reviews, high-quality systematic reviews which concluded that further studies were necessary, or the steering committee considered that further research was required despite the conclusions of recent systematic reviews. An interim survey ranked the 50 questions, and the 10 main research priorities were identified from the top 32 questions by consensus at a final priority setting workshop of patients, carers and healthcare professionals using group discussions. Conclusions: A priority setting process using JLA methods and principles involving patients, carers and healthcare professionals was used to identify the top 10 priority areas for research related to HCAI. Basic, translational, clinical and public health research would be required to address these uncertainties.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antibiotic resistance", "Antimicrobial resistance", "Healthcare-associated infections", "Point-of-care testing", "Research priorities"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Biomedical Research", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cross Infection", "Female", "Health Personnel", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Patients", "Pregnancy", "Research", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073023648", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"55609288400": {"Name": "Wilson P.", "AuthorID": "55609288400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Microbiology and Virology, University College London Hospital NHS Trust"}, "57203105290": {"Name": "FitzGerald G.", "AuthorID": "57203105290", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Microbiology and Virology, University College London Hospital NHS Trust"}, "16301178800": {"Name": "Gurusamy K.S.", "AuthorID": "16301178800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "57197776116": {"Name": "Morley R.", "AuthorID": "57197776116", "AffiliationID": "123526687", "AffiliationName": "James Lind Alliance"}, "56731182100": {"Name": "Whiting C.", "AuthorID": "56731182100", "AffiliationID": "60172638", "AffiliationName": "James Lind Alliance, National Institute for Health Research Evaluation, Trials and Studies Coordinating Centre"}, "57204026207": {"Name": "Maeso B.", "AuthorID": "57204026207", "AffiliationID": "60172638", "AffiliationName": "James Lind Alliance, National Institute for Health Research Evaluation, Trials and Studies Coordinating Centre"}, "57034789100": {"Name": "Bennett S.", "AuthorID": "57034789100", "AffiliationID": "105197141", "AffiliationName": "Healthcare-Associated Infection (HCAI) Service Users Research Forum (SURF)"}, "57189796624": {"Name": "Bostock J.", "AuthorID": "57189796624", "AffiliationID": "105197141", "AffiliationName": "Healthcare-Associated Infection (HCAI) Service Users Research Forum (SURF)"}, "57035137000": {"Name": "Cann M.", "AuthorID": "57035137000", "AffiliationID": "123534882", "AffiliationName": "MRSA Action UK"}, "36989666700": {"Name": "Thompson P.", "AuthorID": "36989666700", "AffiliationID": "105197141", "AffiliationName": "Healthcare-Associated Infection (HCAI) Service Users Research Forum (SURF)"}, "57213993073": {"Name": "Tingle A.", "AuthorID": "57213993073", "AffiliationID": "105197141", "AffiliationName": "Healthcare-Associated Infection (HCAI) Service Users Research Forum (SURF)"}, "6603308208": {"Name": "Brealey D.", "AuthorID": "6603308208", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital NHS Trust, NIHR University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre"}, "57213380218": {"Name": "Kiernan M.", "AuthorID": "57213380218", "AffiliationID": "60004814", "AffiliationName": "Richard Wells Research Centre, University of West London"}, "7007082696": {"Name": "Leaper D.", "AuthorID": "7007082696", "AffiliationID": "60032343", "AffiliationName": "University of Huddersfield"}, "57204832377": {"Name": "Moore M.", "AuthorID": "57204832377", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "University of Southampton"}, "56425777600": {"Name": "Oppenheim B.", "AuthorID": "56425777600", "AffiliationID": "60012191", "AffiliationName": "Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham"}}}
