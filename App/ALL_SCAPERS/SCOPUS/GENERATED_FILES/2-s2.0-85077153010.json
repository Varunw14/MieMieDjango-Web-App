Understanding their social impacts is necessary to improve effectiveness and minimize negative consequences. However, quantifying the impacts of conservation measures that affect large geographic areas and diverse peoples is expensive and methodologically challenging, particularly because such evaluations should capture locally defined conceptions of well-being while permitting policy-relevant comparisons. Here, we measure the impact of Tanzania\u2019s Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs), a national community-based conservation and poverty reduction initiative. We use a novel, cost-effective impact evaluation method based on participatory wealth ranking and Bayesian multilevel modelling. We find that from 2007 to 2015 the impacts of WMAs on wealth were small and variable, with no clear evidence of widespread poverty reduction. Accompanying qualitative data suggest that apparently positive effects in one WMA cannot be directly attributed to WMA activities. Our results suggest that current WMA policy needs to be revisited if it is to promote positive local development.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Community-based conservations", "Conservation measures", "Geographic areas", "Impact evaluation", "Local development", "Poverty reduction", "Qualitative data", "Wildlife management"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077153010", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Food Science", "AGRI", "1106"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"], ["Nature and Landscape Conservation", "ENVI", "2309"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"23990561700": {"Name": "Keane A.", "AuthorID": "23990561700", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of GeoSciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "7402458071": {"Name": "Lund J.F.", "AuthorID": "7402458071", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Food and Resource Economics, University of Copenhagen"}, "55833041600": {"Name": "Bluwstein J.", "AuthorID": "55833041600", "AffiliationID": "60024631", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geosciences, University of Fribourg"}, "30967633400": {"Name": "Nielsen M.R.", "AuthorID": "30967633400", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Food and Resource Economics, University of Copenhagen"}, "35301788600": {"Name": "Burgess N.D.", "AuthorID": "35301788600", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Macroecology, Evolution and Climate, University of Copenhagen"}, "56056178500": {"Name": "Homewood K.", "AuthorID": "56056178500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University College London"}}}
