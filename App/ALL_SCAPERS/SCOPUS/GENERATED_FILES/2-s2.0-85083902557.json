Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Using data from the PRIME Study, an observational study of the menopause in women living with HIV in England, we explored the association between menopausal symptoms and: (i) antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and (ii) HIV clinic attendance. We measured menopausal symptom severity with the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS, score \u226517 indicating severe symptoms), adherence with the CPCRA Antiretroviral Medication Adherence Self-Report Form, and ascertained HIV clinic attendance via self-report. Odds ratios were obtained using logistic regression. Women who reported severe menopausal symptoms had greater odds of suboptimal ART adherence (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2.22; 95% CI 1.13, 4.35) and suboptimal clinic attendance (AOR 1.52; 95% CI 1.01, 2.29). When psychological, somatic and urogenital domains of the MRS were analysed individually there was no association between adherence and severe symptoms (all p > 0.1), however there was an association between suboptimal HIV clinic attendance and severe somatic (AOR 1.98; 95% CI 1.24, 3.16) and psychological (AOR 1.76; 95% CI 1.17, 2.65) symptoms. Severe menopausal symptoms were significantly associated with sub-optimal ART adherence and HIV clinic attendance, however we cannot infer causality, highlighting the need for longitudinal data.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adherence", "ageing", "clinic attendance", "hiv", "Menopause", "women"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083902557", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57195234962": {"Name": "Solomon D.", "AuthorID": "57195234962", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "56466212800": {"Name": "Sabin C.A.", "AuthorID": "56466212800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "7006284234": {"Name": "Burns F.", "AuthorID": "7006284234", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57209757944": {"Name": "Gilson R.", "AuthorID": "57209757944", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "24332902500": {"Name": "Tariq S.", "AuthorID": "24332902500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "55402502600": {"Name": "Allan S.", "AuthorID": "55402502600", "AffiliationID": "60101776", "AffiliationName": "Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust"}, "7004340653": {"Name": "de Ruiter A.", "AuthorID": "7004340653", "AffiliationID": "60110877", "AffiliationName": "ViiV Healthcare"}, "35581226900": {"Name": "Fox J.", "AuthorID": "35581226900", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Guy\u2019s & St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust"}, "37007455300": {"Name": "Dhairyawan R.", "AuthorID": "37007455300", "AffiliationID": "60007800", "AffiliationName": "Barking, Havering and Redbridge NHS Trust"}, "6603346674": {"Name": "Gilleece Y.", "AuthorID": "6603346674", "AffiliationID": "60100018", "AffiliationName": "Brighton & Sussex Medical School"}, "55722574900": {"Name": "Jones R.", "AuthorID": "55722574900", "AffiliationID": "60032993", "AffiliationName": "Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57203678070": {"Name": "Post F.", "AuthorID": "57203678070", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55962135600": {"Name": "Reeves I.", "AuthorID": "55962135600", "AffiliationID": "60005523", "AffiliationName": "Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35476403300": {"Name": "Ross J.", "AuthorID": "35476403300", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6602482250": {"Name": "Ustianowski A.", "AuthorID": "6602482250", "AffiliationID": "60007321, 60009274", "AffiliationName": "North Manchester General Hospital, Penine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "57216566090": {"Name": "Shepherd J.", "AuthorID": "57216566090", "AffiliationID": "60120382", "AffiliationName": "UK Community Advisory Board"}}}
