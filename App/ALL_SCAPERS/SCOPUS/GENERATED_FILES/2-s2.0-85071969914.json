This proposed integrated envelope consisted of two layers, including the base part and insulation part. Construction solid wastes were applied as raw materials and the influences of the raw material ratio, additive content, and sintering temperature on micro and macro performances were investigated. The experiment results show that the optimal sample was sintered at 1200 \u00b0C, with raw materials of 50 wt% waste glass, 40 wt% mineral wool waste, 10 wt% waste quartz for both parts, and with another 2 wt% SiC and 1\u20133 wt% Na3PO4\u00b712H2O for the insulation part. The corresponding optimal samples have the best performance, such as the dense base, a uniform pore structure, and good thermal insulation. Moreover, the energy analysis results revealed that this proposed material has good environmental sustainability and could efficiently reduce the negative impact of thermal bridges with the energy conservation of 8.18%.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Building energy-saving", "Construction solid waste", "Integrated envelope", "Thermal bridges"], "IndexKeywords": ["Additive contents", "Building energy saving", "Energy evaluation", "Environmental sustainability", "Integrated envelope", "Sintering temperatures", "Thermal bridge", "Uniform pore structures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071969914", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57205480160": {"Name": "Ji R.", "AuthorID": "57205480160", "AffiliationID": "60018273", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil and Resource Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing"}, "57205222313": {"Name": "Zheng Y.", "AuthorID": "57205222313", "AffiliationID": "60018273", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil and Resource Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing"}, "57201212643": {"Name": "Chen Z.", "AuthorID": "57201212643", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "Department of Energy and Resources Engineering, College of Engineering, Peking University"}, "55504215000": {"Name": "Wei S.", "AuthorID": "55504215000", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London (UCL)"}}}
