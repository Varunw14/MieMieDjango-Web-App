Recent experimental work has shown, though, that increasing the pressure to values between 1 and 2 GPa (10-20 kbar) leads to a marked increase of methane solubility in water, for temperatures which are well below the critical temperature for water. Here, we perform molecular dynamics simulations based on classical force fields - which are well-used and have been validated at ambient conditions - for different values of pressure and temperature. We find the expected increase in miscibility for mixtures of methane and supercritical water; however, our model fails to reproduce the experimentally observed increase in methane solubility at large pressures and below the critical temperature of water. This points to the need to develop more accurate force fields for methane and methane-water mixtures under pressure.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Classical force fields", "Classical potentials", "Computational studies", "Critical temperatures", "Methane solubility", "Molecular dynamics simulations", "Pressure and temperature", "Supercritical water"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072686771", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57193205994": {"Name": "Pruteanu C.G.", "AuthorID": "57193205994", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "6603834603": {"Name": "Marenduzzo D.", "AuthorID": "6603834603", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "SUPA, School of Physics and Astronomy, Centre for Science at Extreme Conditions, University of Edinburgh"}, "7005956581": {"Name": "Loveday J.S.", "AuthorID": "7005956581", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "SUPA, School of Physics and Astronomy, Centre for Science at Extreme Conditions, University of Edinburgh"}}}
