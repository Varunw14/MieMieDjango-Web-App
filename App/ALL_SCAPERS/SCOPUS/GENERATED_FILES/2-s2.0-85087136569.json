The accuracy of the differential diagnosis was significantly (p < 0.001) greater during secondary examination of ultrasound images compared with the original primary ultrasound examination. The interobserver agreement analysis indicated only a fair to moderate agreement between the two examinations (kappa value 0.41; 95% CI 0.29\u20130.53). Most HM present as early pregnancy failure and identification of early ultrasound signs can improve the differential diagnosis between CHM and PHM.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Complete mole", "First trimester", "Hydatidiform mole", "Miscarriage", "Partial mole", "Ultrasound imaging"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087136569", "SubjectAreas": [["Reproductive Medicine", "MEDI", "2743"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"]], "AuthorData": {"57203176734": {"Name": "Jauniaux E.", "AuthorID": "57203176734", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EGA Institute for Women's Health, Faculty of Population Health Sciences, University College London (UCL)"}, "16507186800": {"Name": "Memtsa M.", "AuthorID": "16507186800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EGA Institute for Women's Health, Faculty of Population Health Sciences, University College London (UCL)"}, "7004871743": {"Name": "Jurkovic D.", "AuthorID": "7004871743", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EGA Institute for Women's Health, Faculty of Population Health Sciences, University College London (UCL)"}, "7007135227": {"Name": "Johns J.", "AuthorID": "7007135227", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Early Pregnancy and Gynaecology Assessment Unit, Kings College Hospital"}, "57202193939": {"Name": "Ross J.A.", "AuthorID": "57202193939", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Early Pregnancy and Gynaecology Assessment Unit, Kings College Hospital"}, "7004794073": {"Name": "Sebire N.J.", "AuthorID": "7004794073", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health and NIHR GOSH BRC"}}}
