Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Bereavement is associated with an increased risk of psychiatric morbidity and all-cause mortality, particularly in younger people and after unnatural deaths. Substance misuse is implicated but little research has investigated patterns of drug or alcohol use after bereavement. We used a national online survey to collect qualitative data describing whether and how substance use changes after sudden bereavement. We conducted thematic analysis of free-text responses to a question probing use of alcohol and drugs after the sudden unnatural (non-suicide) death of a family member or a close friend. We analysed data from 243 adults in British Higher Education Institutions aged 18\u201340, identifying two main themes describing post-bereavement alcohol or drug use: (1) sense of control over use of drugs or alcohol (loss of control versus self-discipline), (2) harnessing the specific effects of drugs or alcohol. Across themes we identified age patterning in relation to substance misuse as a form of rebellion among those bereaved in childhood, and gender patterning in relation to men using alcohol to help express their emotions. The limitations of our sampling mean that these findings may not be generalizable from highly-educated settings to young people in the general population. Our findings describe how some young bereaved adults use drugs and alcohol to help them cope with traumatic loss, and suggest how clinicians might respond to any difficulties controlling substance use.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Accidental death", "Alcohol", "Bereavement", "Drugs", "Grief", "Qualitative research", "Thematic analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Alcohol Drinking", "Bereavement", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Family", "Female", "Grief", "Humans", "Male", "Social Stigma", "Substance-Related Disorders", "Suicide", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078313894", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis", "ENVI", "2307"]], "AuthorData": {"57211493725": {"Name": "Drabwell L.", "AuthorID": "57211493725", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Behaviour Change, Research Department of Clinical, Educational, and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "57211482662": {"Name": "Eng J.", "AuthorID": "57211482662", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Division of Psychology and Language Sciences"}, "7102932453": {"Name": "Stevenson F.", "AuthorID": "7102932453", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Research Department of Primary Care & Population Health"}, "56591241100": {"Name": "King M.", "AuthorID": "56591241100", "AffiliationID": "60161450, 60161451", "AffiliationName": "Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust, St Pancras Hospital"}, "57189923687": {"Name": "Osborn D.", "AuthorID": "57189923687", "AffiliationID": "60161450, 60161451", "AffiliationName": "Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust, St Pancras Hospital"}, "13103656500": {"Name": "Pitman A.", "AuthorID": "13103656500", "AffiliationID": "60161450, 60161451", "AffiliationName": "Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust, St Pancras Hospital"}}}
