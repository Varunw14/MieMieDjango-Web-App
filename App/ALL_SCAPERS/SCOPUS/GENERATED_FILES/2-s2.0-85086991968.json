Recently, deep learning methods have been successfully introduced into the micro-expression recognition area. Whilst the higher recognition accuracy achieved, substantial challenges in micro-expression recognition remain. The existence of micro expression in small-local areas on face and limited size of available databases still constrain the recognition accuracy on such emotional facial behavior. In this work, to tackle such challenges, we propose a novel attention mechanism called micro-attention cooperating with residual network. Micro-attention enables the network to learn to focus on facial areas of interest covering different action units. Moreover, coping with small datasets, the micro-attention is designed without adding noticeable parameters while a simple yet efficient transfer learning approach is together utilized to alleviate the overfitting risk. With extensive experimental evaluations on three benchmarks (CASMEII, SAMM and SMIC) and post-hoc feature visualizations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed micro-attention and push the boundary of automatic recognition of micro-expression.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attention mechanism", "Deep learning", "Micro expression recognition", "Transfer learning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Affective Computing", "Attention mechanisms", "Automatic recognition", "Emotion detection", "Experimental evaluation", "Learning methods", "Micro-expressions", "Recognition accuracy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086991968", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"57202807310": {"Name": "Wang C.", "AuthorID": "57202807310", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College London"}, "57209399116": {"Name": "Bi T.", "AuthorID": "57209399116", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College London"}, "57191359109": {"Name": "Peng M.", "AuthorID": "57191359109", "AffiliationID": "60019499", "AffiliationName": "Intelligent Security Center, Chongqing Institute of Green and Intelligent Technology, CAS"}, "57221071963": {"Name": "Chen T.", "AuthorID": "57221071963", "AffiliationID": "60018614, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychology, CAS"}}}
