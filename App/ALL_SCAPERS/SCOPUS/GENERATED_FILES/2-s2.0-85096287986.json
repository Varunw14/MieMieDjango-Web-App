It extends the method proposed by Reiter (2009) and complements recent work by Ahn, Kaplan, Moll, Winberry, and Wolf (2017) on how to solve such models in continuous time. We suggest first solving for the stationary equilibrium of the model without aggregate risk. We then write the functionals that describe the dynamic equilibrium as sparse expansions around their stationary equilibrium counterparts. Finally, we use the perturbation method of Schmitt-Groh\u00e9 and Uribe (2004) to approximate the aggregate dynamics of the model.", "AuthorKeywords": ["C63", "E32", "heterogeneous agent models", "incomplete markets", "linearization", "Numerical methods"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096287986", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"22933864300": {"Name": "Bayer C.", "AuthorID": "22933864300", "AffiliationID": "110005183", "AffiliationName": "IZA"}, "57204958805": {"Name": "Luetticke R.", "AuthorID": "57204958805", "AffiliationID": "117643319", "AffiliationName": "CFM"}}}
