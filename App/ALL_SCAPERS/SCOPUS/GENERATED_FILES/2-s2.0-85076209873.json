The optimal investigation of NVH is unclear, given the incidence of cancer and the public health implications of testing all individuals with this finding. Objective: We review contemporary literature to determine the association of NVH with the diagnosis of bladder cancer (BC), upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC), and kidney cancer (KC). Evidence acquisition: A systematic review of original articles in English was completed in May 2019. Meta-analyses for the diagnostic accuracy of NVH and urine cytology were performed. Evidence synthesis: We screened 1529 articles and selected 78 manuscripts that fulfilled our inclusion criteria for narrative synthesis. Forty manuscripts were eligible for a meta-analysis (reporting 19 193 persons). The likelihood of a urological cancer in patients with NVH increased with age (<1% in those aged <40 yr), male sex, and cigarette smoking. Less than 1% of patients are found to have a urological cancer after a negative NVH evaluation. Cancer detection rates in individuals evaluated for NVH ranged from 0% to 16% for BC in 37 studies, 0% to 3.5% for UTUC in 30 studies, and 0% to 9.7% for KC in 29 studies. Substantial statistical heterogeneity was present for the meta-analysis of detection rates. Conclusions: We present an up-to-date review of the association of NVH with the diagnosis of BC, UTUC, and KC. Individuals with dipstick positive haematuria aged \u226540 yr, who have had potential precipitating causes excluded, should undergo an evaluation. Re-evaluation of patients with unremarkable initial investigations should be performed in high-risk patients or if new symptoms occur. Patient summary: One in five people have microscopic traces of blood in their urine. This is an important indicator of urological cancer. Investigating all patients is uncomfortable and expensive. We evaluate the risk of cancer and estimate risks to groups of individuals. Up to 20% of the general population have non-visible haematuria (NVH). NVH is an important indicator of urological malignancy, particularly in individuals \u226540 yr of age. Evaluation should include cystoscopy and upper tract imaging in the form of ultrasound or computed tomography urogram.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bladder cancer", "Kidney cancer", "Microscopic haematuria", "Non-visible haematuria", "Upper tract urothelial cancer"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076209873", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"57200947162": {"Name": "Jubber I.", "AuthorID": "57200947162", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Academic Urology Unit, University of Sheffield"}, "57212211573": {"Name": "Conroy S.", "AuthorID": "57212211573", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Academic Urology Unit, University of Sheffield"}, "6603789337": {"Name": "Catto J.W.F.", "AuthorID": "6603789337", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Academic Urology Unit, University of Sheffield"}, "56567835100": {"Name": "Cumberbatch M.G.", "AuthorID": "56567835100", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Academic Urology Unit, University of Sheffield"}, "7004573619": {"Name": "Shariat S.F.", "AuthorID": "7004573619", "AffiliationID": "60010188", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Urology and Reproductive Health, I.M.
