Despite their great importance, many dose-escalation studies use study designs based on heuristic algorithms with well-documented drawbacks. Bayesian decision procedures provide a design alternative that is conceptually simple and methodologically sound, but very rarely used in practice, at least in part due to their perceived statistical complexity. There are currently very few easily accessible software implementations that would facilitate their application. Methods: We have created MoDEsT, a free and easy-to-use web application for designing and conducting single-agent dose-escalation studies with a binary toxicity endpoint, where the objective is to estimate the maximum tolerated dose. MoDEsT uses a well-established Bayesian decision procedure based on logistic regression. The software has a user-friendly point-and-click interface, makes changes visible in real time, and automatically generates a range of graphs, tables, and reports. It is aimed at clinicians as well as statisticians with limited expertise in model-based dose-escalation designs, and does not require any statistical programming skills to evaluate the operating characteristics of, or implement, the Bayesian dose-escalation design. Results: MoDEsT comes in two parts: a \u2018Design\u2019 module to explore design options and simulate their operating characteristics, and a \u2018Conduct\u2019 module to guide the dose-finding process throughout the study. We illustrate the practical use of both modules with data from a real phase I study in terminal cancer. Conclusion: Enabling both methodologists and clinicians to understand and apply model-based study designs with ease is a key factor towards their routine use in early-phase studies. We hope that MoDEsT will enable incorporation of Bayesian decision procedures for dose escalation at the earliest stage of clinical trial design, thus increasing their use in early-phase trials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bayesian statistics", "dose-finding study", "graphical user interface", "logistic model", "Phase I clinical trial", "R software", "shiny app"], "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Antioxidants", "Bayes Theorem", "Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Humans", "Logistic Models", "Maximum Tolerated Dose", "Neoplasms", "Quercetin", "Research Design", "Software", "User-Computer Interface"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077148935", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"55347018400": {"Name": "Pallmann P.", "AuthorID": "55347018400", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Trials Research, College of Biomedical Life Sciences, Cardiff University"}, "7006176282": {"Name": "Mander A.P.", "AuthorID": "7006176282", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60006654", "AffiliationName": "MRC Biostatistics Unit, University of Cambridge"}, "57201587951": {"Name": "Wan F.", "AuthorID": "57201587951", "AffiliationID": "60117771, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics & Statistics, Lancaster University"}, "9846641800": {"Name": "Jaki T.", "AuthorID": "9846641800", "AffiliationID": "60117771, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics & Statistics, Lancaster University"}, "55981311000": {"Name": "Wheeler G.M.", "AuthorID": "55981311000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK UCL Cancer Trials Centre, University College London"}, "8333116700": {"Name": "Yap C.", "AuthorID": "8333116700", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit, University of Birmingham"}, "10239200700": {"Name": "Clive S.", "AuthorID": "10239200700", "AffiliationID": "60013999", "AffiliationName": "Edinburgh Cancer Centre, Western General Hospital"}, "55252311200": {"Name": "Hampson L.V.", "AuthorID": "55252311200", "AffiliationID": "60009968", "AffiliationName": "Statistical Methodology, Novartis Pharma AG"}}}
