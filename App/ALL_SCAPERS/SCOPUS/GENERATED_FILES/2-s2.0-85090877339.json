Skin thickening and joint contractures are often the main presenting features of the disease and may be mistaken for juvenile scleroderma. Case presentation: We report a case of a 13 year-old female presenting with widespread skin thickening and joint contractures from infancy. She was diagnosed with diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis, and treatment with corticosteroids and subcutaneous methotrexate recommended. There was however disease progression prompting genetic testing. This identified a rare heterozygous pathogenic variant c.1499 T > C (p.Ile500Thr) in the SMAD4 gene, suggesting a diagnosis of Myhre syndrome. Securing a molecular diagnosis in this case allowed the cessation of immunosuppression, thus reducing the burden of unnecessary and potentially harmful treatment, and allowing genetic counselling. Conclusion: Myhre Syndrome is a rare genetic mimic of scleroderma that should be considered alongside several other monogenic diseases presenting with pathological fibrosis from early in life. We highlight this case to provide an overview of these genetic mimics of scleroderma, and highlight the molecular pathways that can lead to pathological fibrosis. This may provide clues to the pathogenesis of sporadic juvenile scleroderma, and could suggest novel therapeutic targets.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Myhre syndrome", "Scleroderma", "SMAD4"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090877339", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"]], "AuthorData": {"57218952306": {"Name": "Jensen B.", "AuthorID": "57218952306", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Infection, Immunity and Inflammation Research and Teaching Department, UCL, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "56921075300": {"Name": "Hong Y.", "AuthorID": "56921075300", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Infection, Immunity and Inflammation Research and Teaching Department, UCL, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "55376853000": {"Name": "Omoyinmi E.", "AuthorID": "55376853000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Infection, Immunity and Inflammation Research and Teaching Department, UCL, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7004602186": {"Name": "Brogan P.A.", "AuthorID": "7004602186", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Rheumatology Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24757952100": {"Name": "Eleftheriou D.", "AuthorID": "24757952100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Adolescent Rheumatology Versus Arthritis at UCL"}, "57218952347": {"Name": "James R.", "AuthorID": "57218952347", "AffiliationID": "123158915", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Rheumatology Department, Queensland Children's Hospital"}, "7004749677": {"Name": "Pilkington C.", "AuthorID": "7004749677", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Rheumatology Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57049165000": {"Name": "Sebire N.J.", "AuthorID": "57049165000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Histopathology Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7103231971": {"Name": "Howell K.J.", "AuthorID": "7103231971", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Microvascular Diagnostics, UCL, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
