Dysregulated Notch signaling has also been implicated in human disease, including multiple forms of cancer, and represents an emerging therapeutic target. Successful development of such therapeutics requires a detailed understanding of potential on-target toxicities. Here, we identify autosomal dominant mutations of the canonical Notch ligand Jagged1 (or JAG1) as a cause of peripheral nerve disease in 2 unrelated families with the hereditary axonal neuropathy Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 (CMT2). Affected individuals in both families exhibited severe vocal fold paresis, a rare feature of peripheral nerve disease that can be life-threatening. Our studies of mutant protein posttranslational modification and localization indicated that the mutations (p.Ser577Arg, p.Ser650Pro) impair protein glycosylation and reduce JAG1 cell surface expression. Mice harboring heterozygous CMT2-associated mutations exhibited mild peripheral neuropathy, and homozygous expression resulted in embryonic lethality by midgestation. Together, our findings highlight a critical role for JAG1 in maintaining peripheral nerve integrity, particularly in the recurrent laryngeal nerve, and provide a basis for the evaluation of peripheral neuropathy as part of the clinical development of Notch pathway-modulating therapeutics.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amino Acid Substitution", "Animals", "Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease", "Female", "Genes, Dominant", "Glycosylation", "Humans", "Jagged-1 Protein", "Male", "Mice", "Mutation, Missense", "Receptors, Notch", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081130421", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"35072041100": {"Name": "Sullivan J.M.", "AuthorID": "35072041100", "AffiliationID": "60001117", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"}, "56901083900": {"Name": "Motley W.W.", "AuthorID": "56901083900", "AffiliationID": "60001117", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"}, "56404703500": {"Name": "Aisenberg W.H.", "AuthorID": "56404703500", "AffiliationID": "60001117", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"}, "57215548492": {"Name": "Marshall K.L.", "AuthorID": "57215548492", "AffiliationID": "60001117", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"}, "25822626300": {"Name": "Kong L.", "AuthorID": "25822626300", "AffiliationID": "60001117", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"}, "57215548648": {"Name": "Huh J.S.", "AuthorID": "57215548648", "AffiliationID": "60001117", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"}, "57215545440": {"Name": "Saavedra-Rivera P.C.", "AuthorID": "57215545440", "AffiliationID": "60001117", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"}, "7103335763": {"Name": "Farah M.H.", "AuthorID": "7103335763", "AffiliationID": "60001117", "AffiliationName": "Solomon H.
