Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.The ability to conduct N-heterocyclic carbene-catalysed acyl anion chemistry under ball-milling conditions is reported for the first time. This process has been exemplified through applications to intermolecular-benzoin, intramolecular-benzoin, intermolecular-Stetter and intramolecular-Stetter reactions including asymmetric examples and demonstrates that this mode of mechanistically complex organocatalytic reaction can operate under solvent-minimised conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["acyl anion", "ball milling", "mechanochemistry", "N-heterocyclic carbenes", "organocatalysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acyl anions", "Mechano-chemistry", "Milling conditions", "N-heterocyclic carbenes", "Organocatalysis", "Organocatalytic", "Stetter reaction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075982798", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"]], "AuthorData": {"57195756684": {"Name": "Nicholson W.", "AuthorID": "57195756684", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff Catalysis Institute, School of Chemistry, Cardiff University"}, "57211744156": {"Name": "Seastram A.", "AuthorID": "57211744156", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff Catalysis Institute, School of Chemistry, Cardiff University"}, "57211262167": {"Name": "Iqbal S.", "AuthorID": "57211262167", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff Catalysis Institute, School of Chemistry, Cardiff University"}, "57199858385": {"Name": "Reed-Berendt B.", "AuthorID": "57199858385", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff Catalysis Institute, School of Chemistry, Cardiff University"}, "24829977500": {"Name": "Morrill L.", "AuthorID": "24829977500", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff Catalysis Institute, School of Chemistry, Cardiff University"}, "23018311500": {"Name": "Browne D.", "AuthorID": "23018311500", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff Catalysis Institute, School of Chemistry, Cardiff University"}}}
