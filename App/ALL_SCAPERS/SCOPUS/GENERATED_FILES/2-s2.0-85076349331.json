Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe quantitative analysis of tear analytes in point-of-care settings can enable early diagnosis of ocular diseases. Here, a fluorescent scleral lens sensor is developed to quantitatively measure physiological levels of pH, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+ ions. Benzenedicarboxylic acid, a pH probe, displays a sensitivity of 0.12 pH units within pH 7.0\u20138.0. Crown ether derivatives exhibit selectivity to Na+ and K+ ions within detection ranges of 0\u2013100 and 0\u201350 mmol L\u22121, and selectivities of 15.6 and 8.1 mmol L\u22121, respectively. A 1,2 bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,-N',N'-tetraacetic-acid-based probe allows Ca2+ ion sensing with 0.02\u20130.05 mmol L\u22121 sensitivity within 0.50\u20131.25 mmol L\u22121 detection range. 5-Oxazolecarboxylic acid senses Mg2+ ions, exhibiting a sensitivity of 0.10\u20130.44 mmol L\u22121 within the range of 0.5\u20130.8 mmol L\u22121. The N-(2-methoxyphenyl)iminodiacetate Zn2+ ion sensor has a sensitivity of 1 \u00b5mol L\u22121 within the range of 10\u201320 \u00b5mol L\u22121. The fluorescent sensors are subsequently multiplexed in the concavities of an engraved scleral lens. A handheld ophthalmic readout device comprising light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and bandpass filters is fabricated to excite as well as read the scleral sensor. A smartphone camera application and an user interface are developed to deliver quantitative measurements with data deconvolution. The ophthalmic system enables the assessment of dry eye severity stages and the differentiation of its subtypes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biosensors", "diagnostics", "ophthalmology", "scleral lenses", "smartphones"], "IndexKeywords": ["Detection range", "Early diagnosis", "Ether derivatives", "Fluorescent sensors", "Physiological levels", "Quantitative measurement", "Smart-phone cameras", "Tetraacetic acid", "Biosensing Techniques", "Calcium", "Cations", "Electrolytes", "Equipment Design", "Humans", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration", "Magnesium", "Potassium", "Sclera", "Sodium", "Tears", "Zinc"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076349331", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"55981394200": {"Name": "Yetisen A.K.", "AuthorID": "55981394200", "AffiliationID": "60019722", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Measurement Systems and Sensor Technology, Technical University of Munich"}, "57212269787": {"Name": "Castaneda Gonzalez C.M.", "AuthorID": "57212269787", "AffiliationID": "60019722", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Measurement Systems and Sensor Technology, Technical University of Munich"}, "57212267079": {"Name": "Erenoglu Z.I.", "AuthorID": "57212267079", "AffiliationID": "60019722", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Measurement Systems and Sensor Technology, Technical University of Munich"}, "57205504335": {"Name": "Dong J.", "AuthorID": "57205504335", "AffiliationID": "60019722", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Measurement Systems and Sensor Technology, Technical University of Munich"}, "56402217400": {"Name": "Dong X.", "AuthorID": "56402217400", "AffiliationID": "60019722", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Measurement Systems and Sensor Technology, Technical University of Munich"}, "57212275138": {"Name": "St\u00f6\u00dfer S.", "AuthorID": "57212275138", "AffiliationID": "60019722", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Measurement Systems and Sensor Technology, Technical University of Munich"}, "6603079941": {"Name": "Jakobi M.", "AuthorID": "6603079941", "AffiliationID": "60019722", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Measurement Systems and Sensor Technology, Technical University of Munich"}, "55186898100": {"Name": "Koch A.W.", "AuthorID": "55186898100", "AffiliationID": "60019722", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Measurement Systems and Sensor Technology, Technical University of Munich"}, "57201616282": {"Name": "Jiang N.", "AuthorID": "57201616282", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University"}, "57220221127": {"Name": "Brischwein M.", "AuthorID": "57220221127", "AffiliationID": "60117641, 60117985, 60019722", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, TranslaTUM Campus, Technical University of Munich"}, "6701382766": {"Name": "Hayden O.", "AuthorID": "6701382766", "AffiliationID": "60117641, 60117985, 60019722", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, TranslaTUM Campus, Technical University of Munich"}, "57007849400": {"Name": "Butt H.", "AuthorID": "57007849400", "AffiliationID": "60104134", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Khalifa University"}, "57210287162": {"Name": "Cordeiro M.F.", "AuthorID": "57210287162", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Glaucoma and Retinal Neurodegeneration Group, Department of Visual Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
