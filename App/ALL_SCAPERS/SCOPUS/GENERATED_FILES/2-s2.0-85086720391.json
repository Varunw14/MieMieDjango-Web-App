Using drumming as a demanding multimodal motor training, we compared cerebellar lobular volume and white matter microstructure, as well as cortical thickness of 15 healthy non-musicians before and after learning to drum, and 16 age matched novice control participants. After 8 weeks of group drumming instruction, 3 \u00d730 minutes per week, we observed the cerebellum significantly changing its grey (volume increase of left VIIIa, relative decrease of VIIIb and vermis Crus I volume) and white matter microstructure in the inferior cerebellar peduncle. These plastic cerebellar changes were complemented by changes in cortical thickness (increase in left paracentral, right precuneus and right but not left superior frontal thickness), suggesting an interplay of cerebellar learning with cortical structures enabled through cerebellar pathways.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Cerebellar Cortex", "Cerebellum", "Female", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Motor Activity", "Music Therapy", "Neuronal Plasticity", "Parietal Lobe", "White Matter", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086720391", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55642455100": {"Name": "Bruchhage M.M.K.", "AuthorID": "55642455100", "AffiliationID": "60009796, 60011460", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Warren Alpert Medical School at Brown University"}, "37055546600": {"Name": "Amad A.", "AuthorID": "37055546600", "AffiliationID": "60104665, 60107834", "AffiliationName": "Univ.
