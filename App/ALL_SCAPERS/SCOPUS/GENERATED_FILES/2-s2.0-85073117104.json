Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that involves the autoreactive T-cell attack on axonal myelin sheath. Lesions or plaques formed as a result of repeated damage and repair mechanisms lead to impaired relay of electrical impulses along the nerve, manifesting as clinical symptoms of MS. Evidence from studies in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) models of MS strongly suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction presents at the onset of disease and throughout the disease course. The aim of this study was to determine if mitochondrial dysfunction occurs before clinical symptoms arise, and whether this is confined to the CNS. EAE was induced in C57B/L6 mice, and citrate synthase and mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) complex I\u2013IV activities were assayed at presymptomatic (3 or 10 days post first immunisation (3 or 10 DPI)) and asymptomatic (17 days post first immunisation (17 DPI) time-points in central nervous system (CNS; spinal cord) and peripheral (liver and jaw muscle) tissues. Samples from animals immunised with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) as EAE models were compared with control animals immunised with adjuvant (ADJ) only. Significant changes in MOG compared to control ADJ animals in MRC complex I activity occurred only at presymptomatic stages, with an increase in the spinal cord at 10 DPI (87.9%), an increase at 3 DPI (25.6%) and decrease at 10 DPI (22.3%) in the jaw muscle, and an increase in the liver at 10 DPI (71.5%). MRC complex II/III activity changes occurred at presymptomatic and the asymptomatic stages of the disease, with a decrease occurring in the spinal cord at 3 DPI (87.6%) and an increase at 17 DPI (36.7%), increase in the jaw muscle at 10 DPI (25.4%), and an increase at 3 DPI (75.2%) and decrease at 17 DPI (95.7%) in the liver. Citrate synthase activity was also significantly decreased at 10 DPI (27.3%) in the liver. No significant changes were observed in complex IV across all three tissues assayed. Our findings reveal evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction is present at the asymptomatic stages in the EAE model of MS, and that the changes in MRC enzyme activities are tissue-specific and are not confined to the CNS.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis", "Fatigue and weakness", "Mitochondrial dysfunction", "Multiple sclerosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biomarkers", "Disease Models, Animal", "Disease Susceptibility", "Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental", "Female", "Mice", "Mitochondria", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Reactive Nitrogen Species", "Reactive Oxygen Species", "Severity of Illness Index"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073117104", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"57211238724": {"Name": "Ng X.", "AuthorID": "57211238724", "AffiliationID": "60024805", "AffiliationName": "University Medical Center"}, "8702256100": {"Name": "Sadeghian M.", "AuthorID": "8702256100", "AffiliationID": "123279967", "AffiliationName": "Global Clinical Development, Actelion"}, "7005146428": {"Name": "Heales S.", "AuthorID": "7005146428", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Neurometabolic Unit, National Hospital"}, "7003781174": {"Name": "Hargreaves I.P.", "AuthorID": "7003781174", "AffiliationID": "60028355", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences, Liverpool John Moores University"}}}
