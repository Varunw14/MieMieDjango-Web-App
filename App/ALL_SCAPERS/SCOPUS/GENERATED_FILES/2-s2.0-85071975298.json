The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.Carbon stars (with C/O > 1) were long assumed to all be giants, because only asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars dredge up significant carbon into their atmospheres. The case is nearly ironclad now that the formerly mysterious dwarf carbon (dC) stars are actually far more common than C giants and have accreted carbon-rich material from a former AGB companion, yielding a white dwarf (WD) and a dC star that has gained both significant mass and angular momentum. Some such dC systems have undergone a planetary nebula phase, and some may evolve to become CH, CEMP, or Ba giants. Recent studies indicate that most dCs are likely from older, metal-poor kinematic populations. Given the well-known anticorrelation of age and activity, dCs would not be expected to show significant X-ray emission related to coronal activity. However, accretion spin-up might be expected to rejuvenate magnetic dynamos in these post-mass-transfer binary systems. We describe our Chandra pilot study of six dCs selected from the SDSS for H\u03b1 emission and/or a hot WD companion, to test whether their X-ray emission strength and spectral properties are consistent with a rejuvenated dynamo. We detect all six dCs in the sample, which have X-ray luminosities ranging from log -29.7, preliminary evidence that dCs may be active at a level consistent with stars that have short rotation periods of several days or less. More definitive results require a sample of typical dCs with deeper X-ray observations to better constrain their plasma temperatures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["binaries: general", "stars: carbon", "stars: chemically peculiar", "X-rays: stars"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071975298", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"22975034100": {"Name": "Green P.", "AuthorID": "22975034100", "AffiliationID": "60020680", "AffiliationName": "Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden Street"}, "6506022365": {"Name": "Montez R.", "AuthorID": "6506022365", "AffiliationID": "60020680", "AffiliationName": "Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden Street"}, "7201816814": {"Name": "Drake J.", "AuthorID": "7201816814", "AffiliationID": "60020680", "AffiliationName": "Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden Street"}, "57209772288": {"Name": "Roulston B.", "AuthorID": "57209772288", "AffiliationID": "60019674", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy, Boston University"}, "57210944397": {"Name": "Mazzoni F.", "AuthorID": "57210944397", "AffiliationID": "60033461", "AffiliationName": "University of Massachusetts"}, "56285405800": {"Name": "Filippazzo J.", "AuthorID": "56285405800", "AffiliationID": "60008158", "AffiliationName": "Space Telescope Science Institute"}, "55462551700": {"Name": "Anderson S.", "AuthorID": "55462551700", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy, University of Washington"}, "57193166490": {"Name": "Marco O.", "AuthorID": "57193166490", "AffiliationID": "60019544", "AffiliationName": "Astronomy, Astrophysics and Astrophotonics Research Centre, Macquarie University"}, "57203394181": {"Name": "Farihi J.", "AuthorID": "57203394181", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7401661007": {"Name": "Frank A.", "AuthorID": "7401661007", "AffiliationID": "60027165", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Rochester"}, "35242961300": {"Name": "Kastner J.", "AuthorID": "35242961300", "AffiliationID": "60001777", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, Laboratory for Multiwavelength Astrophysics, Rochester Institute of Technology"}, "14619678800": {"Name": "Miszalski B.", "AuthorID": "14619678800", "AffiliationID": "100801322", "AffiliationName": "Southern African Large Telescope Foundation"}}}
