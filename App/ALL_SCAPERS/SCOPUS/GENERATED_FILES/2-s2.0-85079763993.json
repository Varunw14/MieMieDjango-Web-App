Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdAim: The study aim was to investigate the predictive role of obesity on clinical response following non-surgical periodontal therapy in individuals with severe periodontitis. Methods: A total of 57 BMI obese and 58 BMI normal non-smoker adults with periodontitis (defined as probing pocket depths (PPD) of \u22655 mm and alveolar bone loss of >30% with >50% of the teeth affected) received non-surgical periodontal therapy. Periodontal status was based upon PPD, clinical attachment level (CAL) and full-mouth bleeding score (FMBS). Mean PPD, percentage sites PPD >4 mm, percentage sites PPD >5 mm and FMBS at 2 and 6 months were outcome variables. Propensity score analysis was used to assess the effect of obesity on outcome variables after adjusting for confounders. Results: Statistically significant higher clinical measures (mean PPD, mean percentage of sites with PPD >4 mm, mean percentage of sites with PPD >5 mm and FMBS) were observed in the obese group than the normal group at baseline, 2 and 6 months after therapy (p <.01). At 2 and 6 months, obesity was associated with worse mean PPD (p <.05), percentage sites with PPD >4 mm (p <.05), percentage sites with PPD > 5mm (p <.05) and FMBS (p <.01), independent of age, gender, ethnicity or plaque levels. Conclusions: Obesity compared to normal BMI status was an independent predictor of poorer response following non-surgical periodontal therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["body mass index", "obesity", "periodontal therapy", "periodontitis", "prospective cohort"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079763993", "SubjectAreas": [["Periodontics", "DENT", "3506"]], "AuthorData": {"19637686000": {"Name": "Suvan J.", "AuthorID": "19637686000", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Periodontology, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "57217800260": {"Name": "Patel K.", "AuthorID": "57217800260", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Periodontology, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "6603443853": {"Name": "Darbar U.", "AuthorID": "6603443853", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Periodontology, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "6507515725": {"Name": "D'Aiuto F.", "AuthorID": "6507515725", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Periodontology, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "6507835161": {"Name": "Harrington Z.", "AuthorID": "6507835161", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "King's College Dental Hospital and Institute"}, "35974110300": {"Name": "Petrie A.", "AuthorID": "35974110300", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Biostatistics, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "7004314492": {"Name": "Donos N.", "AuthorID": "7004314492", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Oral Clinical Research, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, QMUL"}}}
