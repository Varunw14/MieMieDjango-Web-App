The boundaries of precision medicine can be extended using multiscale, biophysics-centred workflows that consider the fundamental underpinnings of the constituents of cells and tissues and their dynamic environments. Utilising numerical techniques that can capture the broad spectrum of biological flows within complex, deformable and permeable organs and tissues is of paramount importance when considering the core prerequisites of any state-of-the-art precision medicine pipeline. In this work, a succinct breakdown of two precision medicine pipelines developed within two Virtual Physiological Human (VPH) projects are given. The first workflow is targeted on the trajectory of Alzheimer's Disease, and caters for novel hypothesis testing through a multicompartmental poroelastic model which is integrated with a high throughput imaging workflow and subject-specific blood flow variability model. The second workflow gives rise to the patient specific exploration of Aortic Dissections via a multi-scale and compliant model, harnessing imaging, computational fluid-dynamics (CFD) and dynamic boundary conditions. Results relating to the first workflow include some core outputs of the multiporoelastic modelling framework, and the representation of peri-arterial swelling and peri-venous drainage solution fields. The latter solution fields were statistically analysed for a cohort of thirty-five subjects (stratified with respect to disease status, gender and activity level). The second workflow allowed for a better understanding of complex aortic dissection cases utilising both a rigid-wall model informed by minimal and clinically common datasets as well as a moving-wall model informed by rich datasets.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's Disease", "Aortic Dissection", "Computational Fluid Dynamics", "Dementia", "Glymphatic system", "Haemodynamics", "Multiple-Network Poroelastic Theory", "Virtual Physiological Human (VPH)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Aneurysm, Dissecting", "Aorta", "Brain", "Cohort Studies", "Computer Simulation", "Datasets as Topic", "Female", "Glymphatic System", "Humans", "Hydrodynamics", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Models, Biological", "Regional Blood Flow", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Workflow"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075788327", "SubjectAreas": [["Anatomy", "MEDI", "2702"]], "AuthorData": {"56814624000": {"Name": "Bonfanti M.", "AuthorID": "56814624000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences (WEISS), Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57205314538": {"Name": "Franzetti G.", "AuthorID": "57205314538", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London, Torrington Place"}, "56999470200": {"Name": "Guo L.", "AuthorID": "56999470200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London, Torrington Place"}, "56266099800": {"Name": "Homer-Vanniasinkam S.", "AuthorID": "56266099800", "AffiliationID": "60006343, 60000064", "AffiliationName": "University of Warwick Medical School & University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust"}, "6602671760": {"Name": "Balabani S.", "AuthorID": "6602671760", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London, Torrington Place"}, "6603704133": {"Name": "Ventikos Y.", "AuthorID": "6603704133", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London, Torrington Place"}, "23984658900": {"Name": "Diaz-Zuccarini V.", "AuthorID": "23984658900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences (WEISS), Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "56039685400": {"Name": "Vardakis J.C.", "AuthorID": "56039685400", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Imaging & Simulation Technologies in Biomedicine (CISTIB), School of Computing, University of Leeds"}, "56850405700": {"Name": "Lassila T.", "AuthorID": "56850405700", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Imaging & Simulation Technologies in Biomedicine (CISTIB), School of Computing, University of Leeds"}, "57207458973": {"Name": "Hoz de Vila M.", "AuthorID": "57207458973", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Imaging & Simulation Technologies in Biomedicine (CISTIB), School of Computing, University of Leeds"}, "7005249248": {"Name": "Frangi A.F.", "AuthorID": "7005249248", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Imaging & Simulation Technologies in Biomedicine (CISTIB), School of Computing, University of Leeds"}, "23398817700": {"Name": "Taylor Z.A.", "AuthorID": "23398817700", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Imaging & Simulation Technologies in Biomedicine (CISTIB), School of Mechanical Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "55655267600": {"Name": "Mitolo M.", "AuthorID": "55655267600", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Functional MR Unit, Policlinico S.
