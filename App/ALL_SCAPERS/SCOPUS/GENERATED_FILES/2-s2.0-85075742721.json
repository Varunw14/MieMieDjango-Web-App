Furthermore, few studies provide direct comparisons between exercise and different types of rest. Therefore, by providing a standardised methodological design, this study will ascertain the most effective intensity and protocol of exercise for the modulation of long-term memory, whilst directly comparing it to different types rest. This was achieved using the same old/new recognition memory test and an 80\u201390 min retention interval. Three experiments were performed (total N = 59), each with a three-armed crossover design measuring the extent to which physical exercise and wakeful rest can influence long-term memory performance. In Experiment 1, the effects of continuous moderate intensity exercise (65\u201375% HRmax), passive rest (no cognitive engagement) and active rest (cognitively engaged) were explored. In Experiment 2, continuous moderate intensity exercise was compared to a type of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and passive rest. Experiment 3 observed the effects of low- (55\u201365% HRmax), moderate- and high-intensity (75\u201385% HRmax) continuous exercise. Across the three experiments moderate intensity exercise had the greatest positive impact on memory performance. Although not significant, HIIT was more effective than passive-rest, and passive rest was more effective than active rest. Our findings suggest that it is not necessary to physically overexert oneself in order to achieve observable improvements to long-term memory. By also investigating wakeful rest, we reaffirmed the importance of the cognitive engagement during consolidation for the formation of long-term memories.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cognitive enhancement", "Consolidation", "Continuous exercise", "Exercise intensity", "High intensity interval training (HIIT)", "Wakeful rest"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cross-Over Studies", "Exercise", "Female", "High-Intensity Interval Training", "Humans", "Male", "Memory, Long-Term", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Recognition, Psychology", "Rest", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075742721", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"57212018205": {"Name": "Pyke W.", "AuthorID": "57212018205", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Kent"}, "57212023078": {"Name": "Ifram F.", "AuthorID": "57212023078", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Kent"}, "57212022583": {"Name": "Coventry L.", "AuthorID": "57212022583", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Kent"}, "57212022290": {"Name": "Sung Y.", "AuthorID": "57212022290", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Kent"}, "57212021639": {"Name": "Champion I.", "AuthorID": "57212021639", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Kent"}, "36646044100": {"Name": "Javadi A.H.", "AuthorID": "36646044100", "AffiliationID": "60171616", "AffiliationName": "School of Rehabilitation, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"}}}
