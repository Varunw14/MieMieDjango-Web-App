The neurophysiology and neuroanatomy of these reflex pathways are well understood, however, the mechanisms and functional significance of autonomic circuit modulation by glial cells remain largely unknown. In the experiments conducted in male laboratory rats we show that astrocytes of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), the brain area that receives and integrates sensory information from the heart and blood vessels, respond to incoming afferent inputs with [Ca 2 +]i elevations. Astroglial [Ca 2 +]i responses are triggered by transmitters released by vagal afferents, glutamate acting at AMPA receptors and 5-HT acting at 5-HT2A receptors. In conscious freely behaving animals blockade of Ca 2 +-dependent vesicular release mechanisms in NTS astrocytes by virally driven expression of a dominant-negative SNARE protein (dnSNARE) increased baroreflex sensitivity by 70% (p < 0.001). This effect of compromised astroglial function was specific to the NTS as expression of dnSNARE in astrocytes of the ventrolateral brainstem had no effect. ATP is considered the principle gliotransmitter and is released by vesicular mechanisms blocked by dnSNARE expression. Consistent with this hypothesis, in anesthetized rats, pharmacological activation of P2Y1 purinoceptors in the NTS decreased baroreflex gain by 40% (p = 0.031), whereas blockade of P2Y1 receptors increased baroreflex gain by 57% (p = 0.018). These results suggest that glutamate and 5-HT, released by NTS afferent terminals, trigger Ca 2 +-dependent astroglial release of ATP to modulate baroreflex sensitivity via P2Y1 receptors. These data add to the growing body of evidence supporting an active role of astrocytes in brain information processing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Astrocytes", "Baroreflex", "Cardiovascular", "In vivo", "Nucleus of the solitary tract", "Viral gene transfer"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adenosine Triphosphate", "Animals", "Astrocytes", "Baroreflex", "Calcium Signaling", "Male", "Neurons, Afferent", "Neurotransmitter Agents", "Purinergic P2Y Receptor Agonists", "Purinergic P2Y Receptor Antagonists", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2A", "Receptors, AMPA", "Receptors, Purinergic P2Y1", "Serotonin", "SNARE Proteins", "Solitary Nucleus", "Vagus Nerve Stimulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083085395", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"22956192000": {"Name": "Mastitskaya S.", "AuthorID": "22956192000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular and Metabolic Neuroscience, Department of Neuroscience, Physiology, and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "13004689900": {"Name": "Marina N.", "AuthorID": "13004689900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular and Metabolic Neuroscience, Department of Neuroscience, Physiology, and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "56011079900": {"Name": "Theparambil S.M.", "AuthorID": "56011079900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular and Metabolic Neuroscience, Department of Neuroscience, Physiology, and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "56287207100": {"Name": "Hadjihambi A.", "AuthorID": "56287207100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular and Metabolic Neuroscience, Department of Neuroscience, Physiology, and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7005352395": {"Name": "Ramage A.G.", "AuthorID": "7005352395", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular and Metabolic Neuroscience, Department of Neuroscience, Physiology, and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "57204343249": {"Name": "Gourine A.V.", "AuthorID": "57204343249", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular and Metabolic Neuroscience, Department of Neuroscience, Physiology, and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "56118823200": {"Name": "Hosford P.S.", "AuthorID": "56118823200", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "35754175500": {"Name": "Turovsky E.", "AuthorID": "35754175500", "AffiliationID": "60110604, 60116457", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cell Biophysics, Federal Research Center \u201cPushchino Scientific Center for Biological Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences\u201d"}, "56353446000": {"Name": "Kasparov S.", "AuthorID": "56353446000", "AffiliationID": "60031254", "AffiliationName": "Baltic Federal University"}, "6701598833": {"Name": "Teschemacher A.G.", "AuthorID": "6701598833", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Physiology, Pharmacology, and Neuroscience, University of Bristol"}}}
