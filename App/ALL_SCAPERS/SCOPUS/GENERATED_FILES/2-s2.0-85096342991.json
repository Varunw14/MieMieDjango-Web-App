Hippocampal place cells exhibit spatially selective activity within an environment and have been proposed to form the neural basis of a cognitive map of space that supports these mnemonic functions. However, the direct influence of place cell activity on spatial navigation behavior has not yet been demonstrated. Using an \u2018all-optical\u2019 combination of simultaneous two-photon calcium imaging and two-photon optogenetics, we identified and selectively activated place cells that encoded behaviorally relevant locations in a virtual reality environment. Targeted stimulation of a small number of place cells was sufficient to bias the behavior of animals during a spatial memory task, providing causal evidence that hippocampal place cells actively support spatial navigation and memory.\u00a9 2020 The AuthorsSelective stimulation of a small number of hippocampal place cells in mice provides causal evidence that hippocampal place cells actively support spatial navigation and memory.", "AuthorKeywords": ["all-optical interrogation", "behavior", "hippocampus", "inhibition", "memory", "place cell", "spatial navigation", "two-photon calcium imaging", "two-photon optogenetics", "virtual reality"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096342991", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"55769273400": {"Name": "Robinson N.T.M.", "AuthorID": "55769273400", "AffiliationID": "60089914, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research and Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "57220349854": {"Name": "Descamps L.A.L.", "AuthorID": "57220349854", "AffiliationID": "60089914, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research and Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "56463533600": {"Name": "Russell L.E.", "AuthorID": "56463533600", "AffiliationID": "60089914, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research and Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "57220165161": {"Name": "Buchholz M.O.", "AuthorID": "57220165161", "AffiliationID": "60089914, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research and Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "56565351900": {"Name": "Bicknell B.A.", "AuthorID": "56565351900", "AffiliationID": "60089914, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research and Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "57220165711": {"Name": "Antonov G.K.", "AuthorID": "57220165711", "AffiliationID": "60089914, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research and Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "57207846117": {"Name": "Lau J.Y.N.", "AuthorID": "57207846117", "AffiliationID": "60089914, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research and Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "57220164722": {"Name": "Nutbrown R.", "AuthorID": "57220164722", "AffiliationID": "60089914, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research and Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "8069944100": {"Name": "Schmidt-Hieber C.", "AuthorID": "8069944100", "AffiliationID": "60089914, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research and Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7003425281": {"Name": "H\u00e4usser M.", "AuthorID": "7003425281", "AffiliationID": "60089914, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research and Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}}}
