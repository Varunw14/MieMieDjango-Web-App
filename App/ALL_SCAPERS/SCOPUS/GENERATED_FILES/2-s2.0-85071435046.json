In parallel, experiences from the United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development have highlighted that collaborations with societal stakeholders and experiential approaches are desirable for effective sustainability education. This article examines activities at three institutions\u2014Lund University, Oberlin College and the University of Tokyo\u2014to identify potential models for integrating students into the co-creation of transformational knowledge and sustainability experiments with faculty and multiple stakeholders. We examine the types of outputs that can ensue differing participation models, whilst also considering their impact on university and stakeholder efforts to advance societal sustainability. We argue that transformational sustainability partnerships integrating students can foster the alignment of the three university missions of education, research and community engagement with place-specific needs and sustainability challenges. Accordingly, efforts to promote experiential forms of sustainability education with societal stakeholders should refrain from focusing uniquely on education and encourage synergistic linking of all university missions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Stakeholder collaboration", "Students", "Sustainability education", "Sustainability co-creation", "Transformational knowledge", "University partnerships"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071435046", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"]], "AuthorData": {"54935673600": {"Name": "Trencher G.", "AuthorID": "54935673600", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, University of Tokyo"}, "56780339800": {"Name": "Rosenberg Daneri D.", "AuthorID": "56780339800", "AffiliationID": "60005300", "AffiliationName": "Oberlin College"}, "7401502746": {"Name": "Petersen J.", "AuthorID": "7401502746", "AffiliationID": "60005300", "AffiliationName": "Oberlin College"}, "8300411600": {"Name": "McCormick K.", "AuthorID": "8300411600", "AffiliationID": "60118751, 60029170", "AffiliationName": "International Institute for Industrial Environmental Economics, Lund University"}, "57209043032": {"Name": "Kiss B.", "AuthorID": "57209043032", "AffiliationID": "60118751, 60029170", "AffiliationName": "International Institute for Industrial Environmental Economics, Lund University"}, "55940995900": {"Name": "Terada T.", "AuthorID": "55940995900", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urban Engineering, University of Tokyo"}, "23037745200": {"Name": "Yarime M.", "AuthorID": "23037745200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Science, Technology, Engineering and Public Policy, University College London"}}}
