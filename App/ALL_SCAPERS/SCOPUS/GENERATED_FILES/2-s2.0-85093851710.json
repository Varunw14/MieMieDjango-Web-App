Our proposed architecture incorporates probabilistic mixture models into deep recurrent neural networks. The resulting deep mixture models simultaneously address several practical challenges important in the development of automated high-frequency trading strategies that were previously neglected in the literature: 1) probabilistic forecasting of the price movements; 2) single objective prediction of both the direction and size of the price movements. We train our models on high-frequency Bitcoin market data and evaluate them against benchmark models obtained from the literature. We show that our model outperforms the benchmark models in both a metric-based test and in a simulated trading scenario.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Automated trading systems", "High frequency HF", "High-frequency trading", "Probabilistic forecasting", "Probabilistic mixture models", "Probabilistic modelling", "Proposed architectures", "Single objective"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85093851710", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"57210110255": {"Name": "Lim Y.S.", "AuthorID": "57210110255", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Computer Science"}, "56257234600": {"Name": "Gorse D.", "AuthorID": "56257234600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Computer Science"}}}
