Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) has been shown to be generally safe from a cognitive perspective, with consistent evidence that the major impact of STN-DBS in Parkinson's disease (PD) is on verbal fluency. Objective. The aim of this study was first to identify the influence of acute manipulation of STN-DBS in PD on the number and time pattern of word generation on different verbal fluency (VF) tasks, phonemic, switching, and cued switching, and second to determine whether cueing improved VF and if cueing effects interacted with STN-DBS effects. Methods. Parallel versions of these three verbal fluency tasks were completed by 31 patients with Parkinson's disease who had had bilateral DBS of the STN, twice, with DBS On and Off, with the order counterbalanced across patients. Results. There was no effect of acute STN-DBS on the total number of words generated during verbal fluency. As expected, the number of words generated significantly declined over the six 10-second intervals of the verbal fluency tasks, but this time pattern of word generation was not altered by STN-DBS. External cueing significantly increased the number of words generated relative to an uncued switching verbal fluency task, but the cueing effect on VF was not altered by STN-DBS. Conclusion. In conclusion, (i) acute STN-DBS manipulation did not alter either verbal fluency performance or the time pattern of word generation and (ii) external cueing significantly improved verbal fluency performance both with STN-DBS On and Off.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073630198", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (miscellaneous)", "NEUR", "2801"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57189071142": {"Name": "Atkinson-Clement C.", "AuthorID": "57189071142", "AffiliationID": "60120341", "AffiliationName": "Brain and Spine Institute (ICM), Movement Investigation and Therapeutics Team"}, "57201910573": {"Name": "Leimbach F.", "AuthorID": "57201910573", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7006891841": {"Name": "Jahanshahi M.", "AuthorID": "7006891841", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Hospital of Chengdu Brain Science Institute, MOE Key Lab for Neuroinformation, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}}}
