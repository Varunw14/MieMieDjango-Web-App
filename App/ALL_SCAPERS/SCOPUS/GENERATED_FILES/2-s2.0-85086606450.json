Evidence suggests humans might achieve this by simulating each other\u2019s computations in agent-specific neural circuits, but it is not known how circuits become agent-specific. Here we investigate whether agent-specificity adapts to social context. We train subjects on social learning tasks, manipulating the frequency with which self and other see the same information. Training alters the agent-specificity of prediction error (PE) circuits for at least 24 h, modulating the extent to which another agent\u2019s PE is experienced as one\u2019s own and influencing perspective-taking in an independent task. Ventromedial prefrontal myelin density, indexed by magnetisation transfer, correlates with the strength of this adaptation. We describe a frontotemporal learning network, which exploits relationships between different agents\u2019 computations. Our findings suggest that Self-Other boundaries are learnable variables, shaped by the statistical structure of social experience.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Female", "Humans", "Imagination", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Myelin Sheath", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Social Behavior", "Social Learning", "White Matter", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086606450", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57201884357": {"Name": "Ereira S.", "AuthorID": "57201884357", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL"}, "55240236800": {"Name": "Hauser T.U.", "AuthorID": "55240236800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL"}, "55542790700": {"Name": "Moran R.", "AuthorID": "55542790700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL"}, "56095464900": {"Name": "Story G.W.", "AuthorID": "56095464900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL"}, "57210439880": {"Name": "Dolan R.J.", "AuthorID": "57210439880", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL"}, "21833994400": {"Name": "Kurth-Nelson Z.", "AuthorID": "21833994400", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}}}
