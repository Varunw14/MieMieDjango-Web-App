However, the majority of the ADS GWAS undertaken, to date, have utilized a case-control design and have failed to identify consistently replicable loci with the exception of protective variants within the alcohol metabolizing genes, notably ADH1B. The ADS phenotype shows considerable variability which means that the use of quantitative variables as a proxy for the severity of ADS has the potential to facilitate identification of risk loci by increasing statistical power. The current study aims to examine the influences of using binary and adjusted quantitative measures of ADS on GWAS outcomes and on calculated polygenic risk scores (PRS). METHODS: A GWAS was performed in 1251 healthy controls with no history of excess alcohol use and 739 patients with ADS classified using binary DMS-IV criteria. Two additional GWAS were undertaken using a quantitative score based on DSM-IV criteria, which were applied assuming both normal and non-normal distributions of the phenotypic variables. PRS analyses were performed utilizing the data from the binary and the quantitative trait analyses. RESULTS: No associations were identified at genome-wide significance in any of the individual GWAS; results were comparable in all three. The top associated single nucleotide polymorphism was located on the alcohol dehydrogenase gene cluster on chromosome 4, consistent with previous ADS GWAS. The quantitative trait analysis adjusted for the distribution of the criterion score and the associated PRS had the smallest standard errors and thus the greatest precision. CONCLUSION: Further exploitation of the use of qualitative trait analysis in GWAS in ADS is warranted.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85100280799", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"57221811300": {"Name": "Li W.", "AuthorID": "57221811300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Psychiatry Laboratory, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "42162169300": {"Name": "Thygesen J.H.", "AuthorID": "42162169300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Psychiatry Laboratory, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "56107719700": {"Name": "O'Brien N.L.", "AuthorID": "56107719700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Psychiatry Laboratory, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "57221812220": {"Name": "Bass N.J.", "AuthorID": "57221812220", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Psychiatry Laboratory, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "57200009218": {"Name": "McQuillin A.", "AuthorID": "57200009218", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Psychiatry Laboratory, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "6601996625": {"Name": "Heydtmann M.", "AuthorID": "6601996625", "AffiliationID": "60022565, 60032803", "AffiliationName": "Royal Alexandria Hospital, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde"}, "7404425727": {"Name": "Smith I.", "AuthorID": "7404425727", "AffiliationID": "60032803", "AffiliationName": "Glasgow Addiction Services, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde"}, "36787941900": {"Name": "Degenhardt F.", "AuthorID": "36787941900", "AffiliationID": "60014264", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, University of Duisburg-Essen"}, "57216385889": {"Name": "N\u00f6then M.M.", "AuthorID": "57216385889", "AffiliationID": "60030465, 60007493", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Human Genetics, University of Bonn, School of Medicine & University Hospital Bonn"}, "57221811055": {"Name": "Morgan M.Y.", "AuthorID": "57221811055", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Liver & Digestive Health, Division of Medicine, University College London"}}}
