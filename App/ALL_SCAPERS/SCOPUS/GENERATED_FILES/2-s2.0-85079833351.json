However, modulation of involuntary movements can also be observed in other hyperkinesias. Cases: Here, we present 6 patients with chorea able to suppress their involuntary movements, on demand. In 3 of them, surface electromyography was used to quantify degree of suppression and confirmed a reduction of muscle activity up to 68%, during volitional control. Conclusion: This observation represents a first step toward a description of a new clinical feature in choreic syndromes and an opportunity to redefine the role of volitional inhibition in hyperkinetic movement disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": ["chorea", "EMG", "involuntary movements", "suppression", "volitional control"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079833351", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57190070380": {"Name": "Bonomo R.", "AuthorID": "57190070380", "AffiliationID": "60010146", "AffiliationName": "Department \u201cG.F.
