See http://ivyspring.com/terms for full terms and conditions.Goals of investigation: The 5-year survival rate for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has remained at <5% for decades because no effective therapies have been identified. Integrin \u03b1v\u03b26 is overexpressed in most PDAC and represents a promising therapeutic target. Thus, we attempted to develop an \u03b1v\u03b26-specific peptide-drug conjugate (PDC) for therapy of PDAC. Methodology: We conjugated the DNA-binding pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD)-based payload SG3249 (tesirine) to an \u03b1v\u03b26-specific 20mer peptide from the VP1 coat protein of foot-and-mouth-disease virus (FMDV) (forming conjugate SG3299) or to a non-targeting peptide (forming conjugate SG3511). PDCs were tested for specificity and toxicity on \u03b1v\u03b26-negative versus-positive PDAC cells, patient-derived cell lines from tumor xenografts, and on two different in vivo models of PDAC. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed to establish therapeutic mechanism. Results: The \u03b1v\u03b26-targeted PDC SG3299 was significantly more toxic (up to 78-fold) for \u03b1v\u03b26-expressing versus \u03b1v\u03b26-negative PDAC cell lines in vitro, and achieved significantly higher toxicity at equal dose than the non-targeted PDC SG3511 (up to 15-fold better). Moreover, SG3299 eliminated established (100mm3) Capan-1 PDAC human xenografts, extending the lifespan of mice significantly (P=0.005). Immunohistochemistry revealed SG3299 induced DNA damage and apoptosis (increased \u03b3H2AX and cleaved caspase 3, respectively) associated with significant reductions in proliferation (Ki67), \u03b26 expression and PDAC tumour growth. Conclusions: The FMDV-peptide drug conjugate SG3299 showed \u03b1v\u03b26-selectivity in vitro and in vivo and can specifically eliminate \u03b1v\u03b26-positive cancers, providing a promising new molecular-specific therapy for pancreatic cancer.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Integrin", "PDAC", "Peptide-drug conjugate", "\u03b1v\u03b26"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85080927252", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (miscellaneous)", "PHAR", "3001"]], "AuthorData": {"56294856800": {"Name": "Moore K.M.", "AuthorID": "56294856800", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, John Vane Science Centre"}, "56025029300": {"Name": "Desai A.", "AuthorID": "56025029300", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, John Vane Science Centre"}, "54879377500": {"Name": "de Lux\u00e1n Delgado B.", "AuthorID": "54879377500", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, John Vane Science Centre"}, "56857443300": {"Name": "Trabulo S.M.D.", "AuthorID": "56857443300", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, John Vane Science Centre"}, "57211327311": {"Name": "Reader C.", "AuthorID": "57211327311", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, John Vane Science Centre"}, "57143467500": {"Name": "Brown N.F.", "AuthorID": "57143467500", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, John Vane Science Centre"}, "57215413106": {"Name": "Murray E.R.", "AuthorID": "57215413106", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, John Vane Science Centre"}, "57074911000": {"Name": "Marshall J.F.", "AuthorID": "57074911000", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, John Vane Science Centre"}, "23396226400": {"Name": "Brentnall A.", "AuthorID": "23396226400", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60012754, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK, Centre for Epidemiology, Mathematics and Statistics, Wolfson Institute of Preventative Medicine, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7201430093": {"Name": "Howard P.", "AuthorID": "7201430093", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "Spirogen QMB Innovation Centre"}, "6506158894": {"Name": "Masterson L.", "AuthorID": "6506158894", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "Spirogen QMB Innovation Centre"}, "57194751480": {"Name": "Zammarchi F.", "AuthorID": "57194751480", "AffiliationID": "116665585", "AffiliationName": "ADC Therapeutics (UK) Ltd, QMB Innovation Centre"}, "7003595149": {"Name": "van Berkel P.H.", "AuthorID": "7003595149", "AffiliationID": "116665585", "AffiliationName": "ADC Therapeutics (UK) Ltd, QMB Innovation Centre"}, "35599970900": {"Name": "Hartley J.A.", "AuthorID": "35599970900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK, Drug-DNA Interactions Research Group, University College London Cancer Institute"}}}
