Moderate immunogenicity of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) has been reported in adult kidney transplant recipients (KTR). This study further defines the immunogenicity of PCV13 in this cohort. Methods: 49 KTR were immunized with PCV13. A validated opsonophagocytic killing assay (OPA), a global anti-pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide (anti-PCP) IgG, IgG2, IgM and IgA ELISA, and - for selected patients - a serotype specific anti-PCP WHO reference ELISA were performed pre-vaccination and at month 1 and 12 post-vaccination. Results: Geometric mean OPA titers increased significantly for 13/13 serotypes at month 1 and for 10/13 serotypes at month 12 post-vaccination. Vaccine response defined as an OPA titer \u22651:8 was reached in 9/13 serotypes (median). 53% reached the vaccine response criteria at month 1 and 45% at month 12. At month 1 after vaccination, the median OPA titer in an age-group matched healthy reference population was 5- to 10-fold higher than in KTR. OPA titers correlated strongly with results to the global and serotype specific anti-PCP IgG ELISA. Lower OPA titers significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with albuminuria, an interval between vaccination and transplantation <12 months, age and treatment with mycophenolate mofetil. Global IgG, IgG2, IgM and IgA, as well as serotype specific anti-PCP antibody concentrations (12/13 serotypes) increased significantly at month 1 and 12 post-vaccination. Conclusions: Kidney transplant recipients show a significant humoral response after vaccination with PCV13. Functional antibody response exists, but is not as vigorous as in healthy adults.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Kidney transplant recipients", "Opsonophagocytic assay", "Pneumococcal antibody global serum assays", "Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine", "Pneumococcal vaccination in immunocompromised individuals", "Serotype specific"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081919722", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Veterinary (all)", "VETE", "3400"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57211279780": {"Name": "Oesterreich S.", "AuthorID": "57211279780", "AffiliationID": "60007896, 60014264", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen"}, "7003516727": {"Name": "Witzke O.", "AuthorID": "7003516727", "AffiliationID": "60007896, 60014264", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen"}, "25648771200": {"Name": "Wilde B.", "AuthorID": "25648771200", "AffiliationID": "60007896, 60014264", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen"}, "7005074118": {"Name": "Lindemann M.", "AuthorID": "7005074118", "AffiliationID": "60007896, 60014264", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen"}, "7102146764": {"Name": "Horn P.A.", "AuthorID": "7102146764", "AffiliationID": "60007896, 60014264", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen"}, "7102190212": {"Name": "Goldblatt D.", "AuthorID": "7102190212", "AffiliationID": "124082303", "AffiliationName": "World Health Organisation, Pneumococcal Serology Reference Laboratory"}}}
