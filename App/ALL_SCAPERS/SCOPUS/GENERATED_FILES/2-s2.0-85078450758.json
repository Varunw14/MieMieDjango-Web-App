Otherwise challenging to create via conventional pharmaceutical techniques, 3D printing technologies have been explored for the fabrication of multi-drug loaded dosage forms to reduce pill burden and improve patient adherence. In this study, stereolithography (SLA), a vat polymerisation technique, was used to manufacture a multi-layer 3D printed oral dosage form (polyprintlet) incorporating four antihypertensive drugs including irbesartan, atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine. Although successful in its fabrication, for the first time, we report an unexpected chemical reaction between a photopolymer and drug. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy confirmed the occurrence of a Michael addition reaction between the diacrylate group of the photoreactive monomer and the primary amine group of amlodipine. The study herein demonstrates the importance of careful selection of photocurable resins for the manufacture of drug-loaded oral dosage forms via SLA 3D printing technology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D printed formulations", "Fixed-dose combinations", "Personalized medicines", "Polypills", "Polyprintlets", "Printing pharmaceuticals", "Stereolithographic fabrication"], "IndexKeywords": ["3D printed formulations", "Antihypertensive drugs", "Fixed-dose combination", "Michael addition reactions", "Nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR)", "Polypills", "Polyprintlets", "Three-dimensional (3D) printing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078450758", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Engineering (miscellaneous)", "ENGI", "2201"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"57203585474": {"Name": "Xu X.", "AuthorID": "57203585474", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "56613374000": {"Name": "Robles-Martinez P.", "AuthorID": "56613374000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57200558361": {"Name": "Madla C.M.", "AuthorID": "57200558361", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57214835888": {"Name": "Joubert F.", "AuthorID": "57214835888", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7003826707": {"Name": "Basit A.W.", "AuthorID": "7003826707", "AffiliationID": "60118373", "AffiliationName": "FabRx Ltd."}, "6602683597": {"Name": "Gaisford S.", "AuthorID": "6602683597", "AffiliationID": "60118373", "AffiliationName": "FabRx Ltd."}, "37037477300": {"Name": "Goyanes A.", "AuthorID": "37037477300", "AffiliationID": "60028419", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Farmacolog\u00eda, Farmacia y Tecnolog\u00eda Farmac\u00e9utica, R+D Pharma Group (GI-1645), Universidade de Santiago de Compostela"}}}
