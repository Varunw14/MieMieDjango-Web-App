Neuroimaging analyses have been focused on white matter alterations in preterm subjects and findings have linked neurodevelopment impairment to white matter damage linked to premature birth. However, the trajectory of brain development into childhood and adolescence is less well described. Neuroimaging studies of extremely preterm born subjects in their adulthood are now available to investigate the long-term structural alterations of disrupted neurodevelopment. In this paper, we examine white matter pathways in the preterm adolescent brain by combining state-of-the-art diffusion techniques with graph theory and principal component analysis (PCA). Our results suggest that the pattern of connectivity is altered and differences in connectivity patterns result in more vulnerable premature brain network.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brain efficiency", "Brain vulnerability", "Diffusion MRI", "Graph theory", "PCA", "Prematurity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain development", "Connectivity pattern", "Network-based analysis", "Neurodevelopment", "Neuroimaging Analysis", "State of the art", "Structural alterations", "White matter damages"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85093115724", "SubjectAreas": [["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Geometry and Topology", "MATH", "2608"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"57204653172": {"Name": "Irzan H.", "AuthorID": "57204653172", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, Kings College London"}, "57170730400": {"Name": "Semedo C.", "AuthorID": "57170730400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, Kings College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, Kings College London"}, "22980645100": {"Name": "Melbourne A.", "AuthorID": "22980645100", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, Kings College London"}, "57194053203": {"Name": "H\u00fctel M.", "AuthorID": "57194053203", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, Kings College London"}, "57219876883": {"Name": "Sahota M.", "AuthorID": "57219876883", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, Kings College London"}, "57193533556": {"Name": "O\u2019Reilly H.", "AuthorID": "57193533556", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "7006171979": {"Name": "Marlow N.", "AuthorID": "7006171979", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}}}
