Sacral Anterior Root Stimulators that control the bladder have been available as clinical technology for many years, however these devices cannot measure the fullness of the urinary bladder or detect the onset of reflex voiding. In order to address this fundamental limitation, it is necessary to develop a method for recording the neural signals that encode bladder fullness. This paper presents a proof of concept technique for recording bladder afferents from the extradural sacral roots using a multiple electrode cuff. Results are provided from acute in-vivo experiments performed in sheep.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Clinical technology", "Fundamental limitations", "In-vivo experiments", "Multiple electrodes", "Neural signals", "Proof of concept", "Spinal cords", "Urinary bladder"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090999318", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"56647873300": {"Name": "Metcalfe B.", "AuthorID": "56647873300", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "University of Bath, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}, "57199703921": {"Name": "Prager J.", "AuthorID": "57199703921", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "University of Bath, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}, "36632977300": {"Name": "Sadrafshari S.", "AuthorID": "36632977300", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "University of Bath, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}, "57219008400": {"Name": "Grego T.", "AuthorID": "57219008400", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "University of Bath, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}, "7405402409": {"Name": "Taylor J.", "AuthorID": "7405402409", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "University of Bath, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}, "57220375001": {"Name": "Granger N.", "AuthorID": "57220375001", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Royal Veterinary College"}, "15723130500": {"Name": "Donaldson N.", "AuthorID": "15723130500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering"}}}
