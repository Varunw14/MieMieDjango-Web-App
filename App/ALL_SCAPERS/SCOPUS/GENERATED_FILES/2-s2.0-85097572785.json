Practical data communication requires a frequency-stable comb source in a temperature-varying environment and a minimum tone spacing of 25 GHz to support high-speed DWDM transmissions. To the best of our knowledge, however, to date, there have been no demonstrations of comb sources that simultaneously offer a high repetition rate and stable mode spacing over an ultrawide temperature range. Here, we report a frequency comb source based on a quantum dot (QD) MLL that generates a frequency comb with stable mode spacing over an ultrabroad temperature range of 20-120\u00b0C. The two-section passively mode-locked InAs QD MLL comb source produces an ultra-stable fundamental repetition rate of 25.5 GHz (corresponding to a 25.5 GHz spacing between adjacent tones in the frequency domain) with a variation of 0.07 GHz in the tone spacing over the tested temperature range. By keeping the saturable absorber reversely biased at -2 V, stable mode-locking over the whole temperature range can be achieved by tuning the current of the gain section only, providing easy control of the device. At an elevated temperature of 100\u00b0C, the device shows a 6 dB comb bandwidth of 4.81 nm and 31 tones with >36 dB optical signal-to-noise ratio. The corresponding relative intensity noise, averaged between 0.5 GHz and 10 GHz, is -146 dBc/Hz. Our results show the viability of the InAs QD MLLs as ultra-stable, uncooled frequency comb sources for low-cost, large-bandwidth, and low-energy-consumption optical data communications.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Elevated temperature", "High repetition rate", "Low energy consumption", "Optical signal to noise ratio", "Passively mode-locked", "Relative intensity noise", "Semiconductor mode locked lasers", "Stable mode locking"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85097572785", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57205288136": {"Name": "Pan S.", "AuthorID": "57205288136", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, Torrington Place"}, "57204608011": {"Name": "Zhou Z.", "AuthorID": "57204608011", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, Torrington Place"}, "56115496300": {"Name": "Liu Z.", "AuthorID": "56115496300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, Torrington Place"}, "8276654100": {"Name": "Ponnampalam L.", "AuthorID": "8276654100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, Torrington Place"}, "57202133987": {"Name": "Liu Z.", "AuthorID": "57202133987", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, Torrington Place"}, "55365959800": {"Name": "Tang M.", "AuthorID": "55365959800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, Torrington Place"}, "57191031548": {"Name": "Lo M.C.", "AuthorID": "57191031548", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, Torrington Place"}, "7004751445": {"Name": "Seeds A.", "AuthorID": "7004751445", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, Torrington Place"}, "15765485000": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "15765485000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, Torrington Place"}, "54939079100": {"Name": "Chen S.", "AuthorID": "54939079100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, Torrington Place"}, "57215928920": {"Name": "Huang J.", "AuthorID": "57215928920", "AffiliationID": "60032882", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Photonic Integration, Eindhoven University of Technology"}, "26424497300": {"Name": "Cao Z.", "AuthorID": "26424497300", "AffiliationID": "60032882", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Photonic Integration, Eindhoven University of Technology"}, "57220766911": {"Name": "Nishi K.", "AuthorID": "57220766911", "AffiliationID": "60112205", "AffiliationName": "QD Laser, Inc."}, "7004134386": {"Name": "Takemasa K.", "AuthorID": "7004134386", "AffiliationID": "60112205", "AffiliationName": "QD Laser, Inc."}, "35450232700": {"Name": "Sugawara M.", "AuthorID": "35450232700", "AffiliationID": "60112205", "AffiliationName": "QD Laser, Inc."}, "35394498800": {"Name": "Penty R.", "AuthorID": "35394498800", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Photonics Systems, Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge"}, "35395011200": {"Name": "White I.", "AuthorID": "35395011200", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Photonics Systems, Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge"}}}
