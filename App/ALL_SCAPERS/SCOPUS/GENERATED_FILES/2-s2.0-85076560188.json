As a remarkable representative of 2D materials, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have demonstrated an astonishing photoconductivity and the ultrafast charge carrier dynamics, which provides excellent potentials for ultrafast optical modulators. Herein, by simply transferring a high-quality CVD-grown WSe2 multilayer on plasmon-induced transparency (PIT) metasurfaces, we demonstrate that the transmission amplitude modulation is as high as 43% and the slow light switching is up to 6 ps in the THz regime. Under photoexcitation, both functionalities are dynamically controlled within ~8 ps owing to a merit of ultrafast free carriers\u2019 relaxation in the WSe2 multilayer. Moreover, a theoretical model consisting of two coupled harmonic oscillators and the near-field distributions are simultaneously employed to verify the strong dependence of the active PIT switching behavior on the suppression of the bright mode of split ring resonators. Our proposed versatile active WSe2-functionalized metasurface with a low cost and simple manufacturing will give researchers new insights into the ultrafast switchable metaphotonic devices.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Slow light", "Terahertz metamaterials", "Transition metal dichalcogenides", "Ultrafast photoswitching", "WSe2"], "IndexKeywords": ["Charge carrier dynamics", "Coupled harmonic oscillators", "Near-field distribution", "Photoswitching", "Tera Hertz", "Transition metal dichalcogenides", "Transmission amplitude", "WSe2"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076560188", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57221204270": {"Name": "Hu Y.", "AuthorID": "57221204270", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "35590198700": {"Name": "Jiang T.", "AuthorID": "35590198700", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57203750907": {"Name": "Zhou J.", "AuthorID": "57203750907", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57210739043": {"Name": "Ouyang H.", "AuthorID": "57210739043", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57209509147": {"Name": "Tong M.", "AuthorID": "57209509147", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57203747260": {"Name": "Tang Y.", "AuthorID": "57203747260", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57193228861": {"Name": "Li H.", "AuthorID": "57193228861", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "55598164400": {"Name": "Xu Z.", "AuthorID": "55598164400", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "7401753972": {"Name": "Cheng X.", "AuthorID": "7401753972", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57209619106": {"Name": "Hao H.", "AuthorID": "57209619106", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Computer, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57104014900": {"Name": "Sun H.", "AuthorID": "57104014900", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Computer, National University of Defense Technology"}, "55792104600": {"Name": "You J.", "AuthorID": "55792104600", "AffiliationID": "60069719", "AffiliationName": "National Innovation Institute of Defense Technology, Academy of Military Sciences China"}, "36571054700": {"Name": "Zheng X.", "AuthorID": "36571054700", "AffiliationID": "60069719", "AffiliationName": "National Innovation Institute of Defense Technology, Academy of Military Sciences China"}}}
