In this study, we analyzed early (30-day; 30 M) and late (30\u201390-day; 30\u201390 M) mortality after RC in a Dutch tertiary referral center and determined factors associated with 30 M, 30\u201390 M and 90-day mortality (90 M). Patients and methods: We identified 823 patients who underwent RC for bladder cancer in the Netherlands Cancer Institute between 1997 and 2017. Predictive factors for mortality were analyzed to identify patients with a higher mortality risk. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the influence of patient, surgical and histopathological variables on 30 M, 30\u201390 M and 90 M. Results: Thirty-day mortality was 1.9% and 90 M was 6.0%. Multivariable analysis showed that age (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01\u20131.1, p = 0.002) and ASA 3\u20134 (OR 3.57, 95% CI 1.25\u201310.16, p = 0.002) were significant predictors of 30 M while higher ASA score (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.31\u20136.5, p = 0.009) and higher pathological T stage (OR 8.8, 95% CI 1.9\u201340.4, p = 0.005) were associated with 30\u201390 M. Risk of 90 M was increased in patients with ASA 3\u20134 (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.2\u20134.9, p = 0.01), pT3\u20134 (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.27\u20137.57, p = 0.01) and positive LNs (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.25\u20134.98, p = 0.009). Conclusions: Patient-related factors predicted 30 M whereas both patient-related and cancer-related factors predicted 30\u201390 M. This suggests that patient mix, i.e. patient- vs. cancer-related factors for 30 M and 30\u201390 M, should be taken into account if mortality rates are to be compared between hospitals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["30-day mortality", "90-day mortality", "Bladder", "Cancer", "Radical cystectomy", "Urothelial carcinoma"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075087442", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"57211805621": {"Name": "Korbee M.L.", "AuthorID": "57211805621", "AffiliationID": "60070177, 60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgical Oncology (Urology), Netherlands Cancer Institute \u2013 Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital"}, "57196458693": {"Name": "Voskuilen C.S.", "AuthorID": "57196458693", "AffiliationID": "60070177, 60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgical Oncology (Urology), Netherlands Cancer Institute \u2013 Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital"}, "13404680900": {"Name": "Hendricksen K.", "AuthorID": "13404680900", "AffiliationID": "60070177, 60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgical Oncology (Urology), Netherlands Cancer Institute \u2013 Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital"}, "6508174892": {"Name": "Wit E.M.", "AuthorID": "6508174892", "AffiliationID": "60070177, 60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgical Oncology (Urology), Netherlands Cancer Institute \u2013 Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital"}, "8348880900": {"Name": "van Leeuwen P.J.", "AuthorID": "8348880900", "AffiliationID": "60070177, 60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgical Oncology (Urology), Netherlands Cancer Institute \u2013 Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital"}, "8889252000": {"Name": "Horenblas S.", "AuthorID": "8889252000", "AffiliationID": "60070177, 60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgical Oncology (Urology), Netherlands Cancer Institute \u2013 Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital"}, "7004337935": {"Name": "Meinhardt W.", "AuthorID": "7004337935", "AffiliationID": "60070177, 60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgical Oncology (Urology), Netherlands Cancer Institute \u2013 Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital"}, "7004237921": {"Name": "Bex A.", "AuthorID": "7004237921", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, University College London"}, "7004230990": {"Name": "van der Poel H.G.", "AuthorID": "7004230990", "AffiliationID": "60070177, 60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgical Oncology (Urology), Netherlands Cancer Institute \u2013 Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital"}, "6602152865": {"Name": "van Rhijn B.W.G.", "AuthorID": "6602152865", "AffiliationID": "60030807", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Caritas St. Josef Medical Centre, University of Regensburg"}, "52364173100": {"Name": "Mayr R.", "AuthorID": "52364173100", "AffiliationID": "60030807", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Caritas St. Josef Medical Centre, University of Regensburg"}, "55844833100": {"Name": "Burger M.", "AuthorID": "55844833100", "AffiliationID": "60030807", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Caritas St. Josef Medical Centre, University of Regensburg"}}}
