If a graph G is connected, it is well known and easy to show that R(G,H) \u2265 (| G| - 1)(\u03c7 (H) - 1) + \u03c3 (H), where \u03c7 (H) is the chromatic number of H and \u03c3 (H) is the size of the smallest color class in a \u03c7 (H)-coloring of H. A graph G is called H-good if R(G,H) = (| G| - 1)(\u03c7 (H) - 1)+\u03c3 (H). The notion of Ramsey goodness was introduced by Burr and Erd\u00f6s in 1983 and has been extensively studied since then. In this paper we show that if n \u2265 1060| H| and \u03c3 (H) \u2265 \u03c7 (H)22, then the n-vertex cycle Cn is H-good. For graphs H with high \u03c7 (H) and \u03c3 (H), this proves in a strong form a conjecture of Allen, Brightwell, and Skokan.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cycles", "Expanders", "Ramsey theory"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chromatic number", "Complete graphs", "Graph G", "Ramsey numbers", "Red-blue coloring", "Strong form"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094167322", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"]], "AuthorData": {"37087562400": {"Name": "Pokrovskiy A.", "AuthorID": "37087562400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "35553760600": {"Name": "Sudakov B.", "AuthorID": "35553760600", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, ETH"}}}
