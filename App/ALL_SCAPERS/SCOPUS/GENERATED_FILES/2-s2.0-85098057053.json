Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Antibiotic prescribing in England varies considerably between Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) and general practices. We aimed to assess social and contextual factors affecting antibiotic prescribing and engagement with antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) initiatives. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 22 CCG professionals and 19 general practice professionals. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed thematically. Social/contextual influences were grouped into the following four categories: (1) Immediate context, i.e., patients\u2019 social characteristics (e.g., deprivation and culture), clinical factors, and practice and clinician characteristics (e.g., \u201cstruggling\u201d with staff shortage/turnover) were linked to higher prescribing. (2)Wider context, i.e., pressures on the healthcare system, limited resources, and competing priorities were seen to reduce engagement with AMS. (3) Collaborative and whole system approaches, i.e., communication, multidisciplinary networks, leadership, and teamwork facilitated prioritizing AMS, learning, and consistency. (4) Relativity of appropriate prescribing, i.e., \u201chigh\u201d or \u201cappropriate\u201d prescribing was perceived as relative, depending on comparators, and disregarding different contexts, but social norms around antibiotic use among professionals and patients seemed to be changing. Further optimization of antibiotic prescribing would benefit from addressing social/contextual factors and addressing wider health inequalities, not only targeting individual clinicians. Tailoring and adapting to local contexts and constraints, ensuring adequate time and resources for AMS, and collaborative, whole system approaches to promote consistency may help promote AMS.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antibiotic prescribing", "Antimicrobial stewardship", "Primary care", "Qualitative"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85098057053", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)", "PHAR", "3000"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"56871266500": {"Name": "Borek A.J.", "AuthorID": "56871266500", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nufield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "55814434300": {"Name": "Butler C.C.", "AuthorID": "55814434300", "AffiliationID": "125564306", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Protection Research Unit in Healthcare Associated Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance"}, "37033113000": {"Name": "Tonkin-Crine S.", "AuthorID": "37033113000", "AffiliationID": "125564306", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Protection Research Unit in Healthcare Associated Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance"}, "18436163600": {"Name": "Anthierens S.", "AuthorID": "18436163600", "AffiliationID": "60012937", "AffiliationName": "Department of Family Medicine and Population Health, University of Antwerp"}, "57191912268": {"Name": "Allison R.", "AuthorID": "57191912268", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care and Interventions Unit, Public Health England"}, "7006646627": {"Name": "McNulty C.A.M.", "AuthorID": "7006646627", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care and Interventions Unit, Public Health England"}, "6506882389": {"Name": "Anyanwu P.E.", "AuthorID": "6506882389", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, College of Biomedical and Life Sciences, Cardiff University"}, "24780732400": {"Name": "Costelloe C.", "AuthorID": "24780732400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Public Health, Imperial College London"}, "7403910584": {"Name": "Walker A.S.", "AuthorID": "7403910584", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nufield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
