Responding to the plea for more empirical research in this area, specifically in secondary education, this study investigates the student's perspective by looking at the relationship between their level of engagement in literature lessons in English as a foreign language (EFL) and how they value these lessons. A total of 365 Dutch students from six secondary schools participated in the study. Data was collected via a four-point Likert-type questionnaire. The findings revealed that students primarily value EFL literature lessons for improving their language proficiency but no significant correlations were found between engagement and language aspects. Implications for curriculum development include a tripartite focus on language learning, literary study, as well as personal development.", "AuthorKeywords": ["foreign language learning", "language-literature instruction", "secondary education", "student engagement", "student perspective"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074286096", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"57126265400": {"Name": "Bloemert J.", "AuthorID": "57126265400", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "University of Groningen"}, "7202577771": {"Name": "Jansen E.", "AuthorID": "7202577771", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "University of Groningen"}, "23006114400": {"Name": "Paran A.", "AuthorID": "23006114400", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
