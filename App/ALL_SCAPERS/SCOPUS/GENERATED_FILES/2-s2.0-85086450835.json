The pathology associated with ephedrone neurotoxicity has not been described yet in the scientific literature. Objectives: To report the first neuropathological study of ephedrone toxicity. Methods: The brain of a 33-year-old Ukrainian female ex-ephedrone addict with a long history of l-dopa-unresponsive parkinsonism with dysarthria, dystonia, profound postural instability, cock-gait, and frequent falls, and on antiretroviral treatment, was examined using routine stains and immunohistochemistry. Results: Neuropathological findings included diffuse pallidal astrogliosis without neuronal depletion. There was also widespread vascular pathology with small vessels occluded by foreign material, associated with giant cell response without any evidence of consequent focal infarction and a cerebellar abscess. Conclusions: Clinical findings of l-dopa-unresponsive parkinsonism with dystonia, caused by illicit use of ephedrone, are fully consistent with neuropathological changes in the pallidum, lack of change in the SN, and preserved tyrosine hydroxylase activity. The findings in the basal ganglia are compatible with manganese toxicity. The vascular pathology is likely a joint effect of infection and the ephedrone toxicity on the vessels. \u00a9 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dystonia", "ephedrone encephalopathy", "manganism", "methcathinone", "parkinsonism"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086450835", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57211894298": {"Name": "Sanotsky Y.", "AuthorID": "57211894298", "AffiliationID": "100519069", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Lviv Regional Clinical Hospital"}, "55410183300": {"Name": "Fedoryshyn L.", "AuthorID": "55410183300", "AffiliationID": "100519069", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Lviv Regional Clinical Hospital"}, "57217146351": {"Name": "Semeryak O.", "AuthorID": "57217146351", "AffiliationID": "100519069", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Lviv Regional Clinical Hospital"}, "26040875800": {"Name": "Matviyenko Y.", "AuthorID": "26040875800", "AffiliationID": "60028222", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Danylo Halytsky Lviv National Medical University"}, "6601975655": {"Name": "Selikhova M.", "AuthorID": "6601975655", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Queen Square Brain Bank, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "7101772051": {"Name": "Holton J.L.", "AuthorID": "7101772051", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Queen Square Brain Bank, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "57208252964": {"Name": "Lees A.J.", "AuthorID": "57208252964", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Queen Square Brain Bank, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "6603882758": {"Name": "Dziewulska D.", "AuthorID": "6603882758", "AffiliationID": "60069009", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Medical University of Warsaw"}, "57109205200": {"Name": "Kuzyk P.", "AuthorID": "57109205200", "AffiliationID": "60005421", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathological Anatomy #2, Bogomolets National Medical University"}}}
