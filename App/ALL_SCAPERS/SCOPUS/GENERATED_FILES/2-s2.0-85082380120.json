ID is characterized by significant limitations in intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour. The identification of genetic variants causing ID and neurodevelopmental disorders using whole-exome sequencing (WES) has proven to be successful. So far more than 1222 primary and 1127 candidate genes are associated with ID. Methods: To determine pathogenic variants causative of ID in three unrelated consanguineous Pakistani families, we used a combination of WES, homozygosity-by-descent mapping, de-deoxy sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. Results: Rare pathogenic single nucleotide variants identified by WES which passed our filtering strategy were confirmed by traditional Sanger sequencing and segregation analysis. Novel and deleterious variants in VPS53, GLB1, and MLC1, genes previously associated with variable neurodevelopmental anomalies, were found to segregate with the disease in the three families. Conclusions: This study expands our knowledge on the molecular basis of ID as well as the clinical heterogeneity associated to different rare genetic causes of neurodevelopmental disorders. This genetic study could also provide additional knowledge to help genetic assessment as well as clinical and social management of ID in Pakistani families.", "AuthorKeywords": ["GLB1 gene", "Intellectual disability", "MLC1 gene", "VPS53 gene", "Whole exome sequencing"], "IndexKeywords": ["beta-Galactosidase", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Consanguinity", "Family", "Female", "Genes, Recessive", "Genetic Heterogeneity", "Genetic Testing", "Homozygote", "Humans", "Intellectual Disability", "Male", "Membrane Proteins", "Neurodevelopmental Disorders", "Pakistan", "Pedigree", "Polymorphism, Genetic", "Vesicular Transport Proteins", "Whole Exome Sequencing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082380120", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"57220532451": {"Name": "Ilyas M.", "AuthorID": "57220532451", "AffiliationID": "60058195", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, International Islamic University Islamabad"}, "35778776500": {"Name": "Mir A.", "AuthorID": "35778776500", "AffiliationID": "60058195", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, International Islamic University Islamabad"}, "55567766600": {"Name": "Efthymiou S.", "AuthorID": "55567766600", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuromuscular Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6507973880": {"Name": "Salpietro V.", "AuthorID": "6507973880", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuromuscular Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7003363686": {"Name": "Houlden H.", "AuthorID": "7003363686", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuromuscular Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "24587626300": {"Name": "Noureen N.", "AuthorID": "24587626300", "AffiliationID": "108938231", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Neurology, Children's Hospital, Institute of Child Health"}, "57211980297": {"Name": "Zafar F.", "AuthorID": "57211980297", "AffiliationID": "108938231", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Neurology, Children's Hospital, Institute of Child Health"}, "55486475500": {"Name": "Rauf S.", "AuthorID": "55486475500", "AffiliationID": "60064058", "AffiliationName": "National Center for Bioinformatics, Quaid-i-Azam University"}}}
