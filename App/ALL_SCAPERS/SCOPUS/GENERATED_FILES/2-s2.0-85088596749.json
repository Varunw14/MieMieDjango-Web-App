Despite these advantages, SSBF modalities suffer from reduced axial resolution caused by out of focus sub-surface signals at the block face. In order to restore axial resolution, the sub-surface signal must be removed. In this work, we describe a methodology for restoring the axial resolution through a combination of sample preparation and deconvolution in post-processing. An opacifying agent used during sample preparation, decreases the subsurface signal by absorbing excitation light. From these image stacks we estimate parameters to generate a highly asymmetric point-spread function (PSF), which is then used in a Richardson-Lucy deconvolution algorithm. Whilst our methodology can be widely applied to any SSBF technique, we show its application in multi-fluorescent high resolution episcopic microscopy (MF-HREM), which is a simple and cost-effective alternative to optical sectioning techniques such as two-photon microscopy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deconvolution", "Point-spread-function", "Serial-sectioning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Axial resolutions", "Block-face imaging", "Deconvolution algorithm", "ITS applications", "Optical sectioning", "Sample preparation", "Serial sectioning", "Two photon microscopy"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088596749", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"]], "AuthorData": {"57194087998": {"Name": "Walsh C.", "AuthorID": "57194087998", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57203667680": {"Name": "Holroyd N.", "AuthorID": "57203667680", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "24921854100": {"Name": "Shipley R.", "AuthorID": "24921854100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57203674289": {"Name": "Walker-Samuel S.", "AuthorID": "57203674289", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
