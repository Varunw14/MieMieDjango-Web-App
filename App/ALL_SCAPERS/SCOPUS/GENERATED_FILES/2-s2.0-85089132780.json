While the formation of an actin purse string has been identified as one of the main mechanisms, far less is known about the effects of the viscoelastic properties of the surrounding cells, and the different contribution of the junctional and cytoplasmic contractilities. In this paper, we simulate the wound healing process, resorting to a hybrid vertex model that includes cell boundary and cytoplasmic contractilities explicitly, together with a differentiated viscoelastic rheology based on an adaptive rest-length. From experimental measurements of the recoil and closure phases of wounds in the Drosophila wing disc epithelium, we fit tissue viscoelastic properties. We then analyse in terms of closure rate and energy requirements the contributions of junctional and cytoplasmic contractilities. Our results suggest that reduction of junctional stiffness rather than cytoplasmic stiffness has a more pronounced effect on shortening closure times, and that intercalation rate has a minor effect on the stored energy, but contributes significantly to shortening the healing duration, mostly in the later stages.", "AuthorKeywords": ["computational mechanics", "rheology", "vertex model", "wound healing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cell boundary", "Closure phasis", "Contractile force", "Energy requirements", "Measurements of", "Viscoelastic properties", "Viscoelastic rheology", "Wound healing process"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089132780", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"56535382600": {"Name": "Mosaffa P.", "AuthorID": "56535382600", "AffiliationID": "60007592", "AffiliationName": "Laboratori de C\u00e0lcul Num\u00e8ric (LaC\u00e0N), Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona-Tech"}, "6701809183": {"Name": "Rodr\u00edguez-Ferran A.", "AuthorID": "6701809183", "AffiliationID": "60007592", "AffiliationName": "Laboratori de C\u00e0lcul Num\u00e8ric (LaC\u00e0N), Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona-Tech"}, "7402874069": {"Name": "Mu\u00f1oz J.J.", "AuthorID": "7402874069", "AffiliationID": "60007592", "AffiliationName": "Laboratori de C\u00e0lcul Num\u00e8ric (LaC\u00e0N), Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona-Tech"}, "56853688900": {"Name": "Tetley R.J.", "AuthorID": "56853688900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for the Physics of Living Systems, University College London"}, "55459037100": {"Name": "Mao Y.", "AuthorID": "55459037100", "AffiliationID": "60064143", "AffiliationName": "College of Information and Control, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology"}}}
