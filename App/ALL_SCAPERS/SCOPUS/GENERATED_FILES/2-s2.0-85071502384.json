We prepared blue and green emitting PLEDs using commercial light-emitting polymers, and then characterised the device emission (spectrum and power), and extracted their circuit parameters for their electrical equivalent model for driving with small signals. In addition, we characterised the bandwidth (\\boldsymbol{B-{mod}}) of the devices over a period of continuous driving (\u223c 4 h) and found that for the blue PLEDs the \\boldsymbol{B-{mod}} decreased from an initial 750 kHz to a steady state of \u223c250 kHz. The green-emitting devices were found to benefit from an extended \\boldsymbol{B-{mod}} of \u223c1.5 MHz at the beginning of the test, which then stabilised to \u223c850 kHz. Furthermore, with the addition of a first order RC filter we show that, the steady state \\boldsymbol{B-{mod}} of the blue PLED cane be increased by a factor of \u223c3, thus allowing > 1 Mbps non-return to zero on-off keying (NRZ OOK) data transmission in a complete VLC system.", "AuthorKeywords": ["circuit design", "modelling", "modulation", "organic light-emitting didoes", "visible light communications"], "IndexKeywords": ["Circuit designs", "Electrical equivalent models", "Light emitting polymer", "Non-return to zeros", "Organic light-emitting", "Polymer light emitting diode", "Polymer light-emitting diodes", "Visible light communications (VLC)"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071502384", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"]], "AuthorData": {"35093759400": {"Name": "Burton A.", "AuthorID": "35093759400", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Optical Communications Research Group, Northumbria University"}, "55103012600": {"Name": "Haigh P.A.", "AuthorID": "55103012600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Photonics Innovations Laboratory, University College London"}, "7004547192": {"Name": "Ghassemlooy Z.", "AuthorID": "7004547192", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Optical Communications Research Group, Northumbria University"}, "25123131200": {"Name": "Minh H.L.", "AuthorID": "25123131200", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Optical Communications Research Group, Northumbria University"}, "7003497031": {"Name": "Darwazeh I.", "AuthorID": "7003497031", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Optical Communications Research Group, Northumbria University"}, "55840747800": {"Name": "Minotto A.", "AuthorID": "55840747800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7006071546": {"Name": "Cacialli F.", "AuthorID": "7006071546", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
