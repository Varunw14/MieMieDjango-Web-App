To this end, inhibition of the insulin/insulin-like signalling (IIS) pathway can extend healthy lifespan in diverse animal species, but with trade-offs including delayed development. It is possible that distinct cell types underlie effects on development and ageing; cell-type-specific strategies could therefore potentially avoid negative trade-offs when targeting diseases of ageing, including prevalent neurodegenerative diseases. The highly conserved diversity of neuronal and non-neuronal (glial) cell types in the Drosophila nervous system makes it an attractive system to address this possibility. We have thus investigated whether IIS in distinct glial cell populations differentially modulates development and lifespan in Drosophila. Results: We report here that glia-specific IIS inhibition, using several genetic means, delays development while extending healthy lifespan. The effects on lifespan can be recapitulated by adult-onset IIS inhibition, whereas developmental IIS inhibition is dispensable for modulation of lifespan. Notably, the effects we observe on both lifespan and development act through the PI3K branch of the IIS pathway and are dependent on the transcription factor FOXO. Finally, IIS inhibition in several glial subtypes can delay development without extending lifespan, whereas the same manipulations in astrocyte-like glia alone are sufficient to extend lifespan without altering developmental timing. Conclusions: These findings reveal a role for distinct glial subpopulations in the organism-wide modulation of development and lifespan, with IIS in astrocyte-like glia contributing to lifespan modulation but not to developmental timing. Our results enable a more complete picture of the cell-type-specific effects of the IIS network, a pathway whose evolutionary conservation in humans make it tractable for therapeutic interventions. Our findings therefore underscore the necessity for cell-type-specific strategies to optimise interventions for the diseases of ageing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ageing", "Astrocytes", "Glia", "Insulin signalling", "Lifespan"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091050766", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"], ["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Plant Science", "AGRI", "1110"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"36794919900": {"Name": "Woodling N.S.", "AuthorID": "36794919900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Healthy Ageing, Department of Genetics Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "57201978362": {"Name": "Rajasingam A.", "AuthorID": "57201978362", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Healthy Ageing, Department of Genetics Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "57216435072": {"Name": "Minkley L.J.", "AuthorID": "57216435072", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Healthy Ageing, Department of Genetics Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "57219022197": {"Name": "Rizzo A.", "AuthorID": "57219022197", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Healthy Ageing, Department of Genetics Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "57202667589": {"Name": "Partridge L.", "AuthorID": "57202667589", "AffiliationID": "60103814", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing"}}}
