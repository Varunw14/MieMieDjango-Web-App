Atenas et al.Participation in democracy, in today\u2019s digital and datafied society, requires the development of a series of transversal skills, which should be fostered in higher education (HE) through critically oriented pedagogies that interweave technical data skills and practices together with information and media liter-acies. If students are to navigate the turbulent waters of data and algorithms, then data literacies must be featured in academic development programmes, thereby enabling HE to lead in the development of approaches to understanding and analysing data, in order to foster reflection on how data are constructed and operationalised across societies, and provide opportunities to learn from the analysis of data from a range of sources. The key strategy proposed is to adopt the use of open data as open educational resources in the context of prob-lem-and research-based learning activities. This paper introduces a conceptual analysis including an integrative overview of relevant literature, to provide a landscape perspective to support the development of academic training and curriculum design programmes in HE to contribute to civic participation and to the promotion of social justice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Capacity building", "Civic education", "Critical data studies", "Critical pedagogy", "Government", "Human rights", "Open data", "Open education", "Open government", "Policy", "Politics", "Social justice"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092446150", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"56303405500": {"Name": "Atenas J.", "AuthorID": "56303405500", "AffiliationID": "125208889", "AffiliationName": "Latin American Initiative for Open Data"}, "56303883500": {"Name": "Havemann L.", "AuthorID": "56303883500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55619164000": {"Name": "Timmermann C.", "AuthorID": "55619164000", "AffiliationID": "60012464", "AffiliationName": "Interdisciplinary Centre for Studies in Bioethics, University of Chile"}}}
