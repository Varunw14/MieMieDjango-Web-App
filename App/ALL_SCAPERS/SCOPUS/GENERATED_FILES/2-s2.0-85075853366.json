However, the ideal contrast agent for this purpose is not yet determined. The monoclonal antibody cetuximab targets the EGFR receptor, which is overexpressed in 64% of pancreatic cancers. We investigated the efficacy of near-infrared emitting silver sulphide Quantum Dot (QD)-cetuximab nanoconjugates for targeting EGFR-positive pancreatic cancer. Methods: 2-Mercaptopropionic acid-coated QDs were prepared from AgNO3 and Na2S. Pancreatic cancer cell lines PANC-1 and CFPAC-1 were confirmed EGFR-positive using a commercial AlexaFluor488-cetuximab probe. Nonconjugated QD and cetuximab-conjugated QD (QD-cetuximab) toxicity was assessed after 24 and 48 hours using MTT assay. Fluorescence microscopy was performed following a) formaldehyde-fixed immunofluorescence and b) live staining with QD-cetuximab for four hours at concentrations corresponding to 0, 10, 50, 100, 200, 400 and 600\u03bcg ml-1 of silver. Results: Untargeted QDs were non-toxic in both cell lines after 48 hours at all investigated concentrations, whereas QDcetuximab was toxic at 100\u03bcg ml-1 after 24 hours in PANC-1 and at 10\u03bcg ml-1 in CFPAC-1. Fixed immunofluorescence demonstrated EGFR targeting by QD-cetuximab at concentrations of 50\u03bcg ml-1 upwards in both cell lines. Live staining demonstrated similar efficacy of EGFR targeting up to 50\u03bcg ml-1, although a reduction of fluorescence at higher concentrations was observed when compared to fixed immunofluorescence. Conclusion: Silver sulphide QD-cetuximab nanoconjugates have the potential to target live EGFR-positive pancreatic cancer cells at doses of up to 50 \u03bcg ml-1. The reduction in QD fluorescence observed at higher concentrations is likely to be secondary to cetuximab toxicity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Epidermal growth factor receptor", "Image-guided surgery", "Pancreatic cancer", "Photodiagnostics", "Quantum dots"], "IndexKeywords": ["Contrast agent", "Epidermal growth factor receptors", "Guided surgery", "Image guided surgery", "Local recurrence", "Pancreatic cancers", "Photodiagnostics", "Silver sulphide"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075853366", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"32167598500": {"Name": "Labib P.L.", "AuthorID": "32167598500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London, Royal Free Campus, Royal Free Hospital"}, "55944100900": {"Name": "Pereira S.P.", "AuthorID": "55944100900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London, Royal Free Campus, Royal Free Hospital"}, "26636178300": {"Name": "Yaghini E.", "AuthorID": "26636178300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London, Royal Free Campus, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7402965763": {"Name": "Davidson B.R.", "AuthorID": "7402965763", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London, Royal Free Campus, Royal Free Hospital"}, "26643365600": {"Name": "MacRobert A.J.", "AuthorID": "26643365600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London, Royal Free Campus, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57204294898": {"Name": "Loizidou M.", "AuthorID": "57204294898", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London, Royal Free Campus, Royal Free Hospital"}, "56692900300": {"Name": "Hashemkhani M.", "AuthorID": "56692900300", "AffiliationID": "60006369", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Ko\u00e7 University"}, "6506581390": {"Name": "Acar H.Y.", "AuthorID": "6506581390", "AffiliationID": "60006369", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Ko\u00e7 University"}}}
