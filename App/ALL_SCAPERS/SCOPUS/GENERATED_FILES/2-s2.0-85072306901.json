In contrast to conventional training based techniques, we exploit radar probing waveforms as pilot signals, which requires no coordination between the systems. As the radar randomly transmits searching and tracking waveforms, it is challenging for the BS to directly obtain the ICSI. We therefore propose a Rao test approach to firstly identify the working mode of the radar, and then estimate the channel. We further provide theoretical performance analysis for the Rao detector. Finally, we assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach by numerical simulations, which show that the BS is able to estimate the ICSI with limited information from the radar.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Interfering channels", "Limited information", "Multi-input multi-output radars", "Pilot signals", "Precoding designs", "Theoretical performance", "Wave forms", "Working mode"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072306901", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"]], "AuthorData": {"57211818673": {"Name": "Liu F.", "AuthorID": "57211818673", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "23009493900": {"Name": "Masouros C.", "AuthorID": "23009493900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56349424500": {"Name": "Garcia-Rodriguez A.", "AuthorID": "56349424500", "AffiliationID": "60021378", "AffiliationName": "Nokia Bell Labs"}, "55028597300": {"Name": "Geraci G.", "AuthorID": "55028597300", "AffiliationID": "60032942", "AffiliationName": "Universitat Pompeu Fabra"}}}
