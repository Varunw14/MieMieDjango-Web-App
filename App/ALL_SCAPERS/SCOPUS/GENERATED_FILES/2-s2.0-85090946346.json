Methods: We retrospectively collected clinical data and outcomes of COVID-19 positive cancer patients treated consecutively in five North London hospitals (cohort A). Outcomes recorded included time interval between most recent anti-cancer treatment and admission, severe outcome [a composite endpoint of intensive care unit (ITU) admission, ventilation and/or death] and mortality. Outcomes were compared with consecutively admitted COVID-19 positive patients, without a history of cancer (cohort B), treated at the primary centre during the same time period (1 March\u201330 April 2020). Patients were matched for age, gender and comorbidity. Results: The median age in both cohorts was 74 years, with 67% male, and comprised of 30 patients with cancer, and 90 without (1:3 ratio). For cohort B, 579 patients without a history of cancer and consecutively admitted were screened from the primary London hospital, 105 were COVID-19 positive and 90 were matched and included. Excluding cancer, both cohorts had a median of two comorbidities. The odds ratio (OR) for mortality, comparing patients with cancer to those without, was 1.05 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.4\u20132.5], and severe outcome (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.4\u20132.0) suggesting no increased risk of death or a severe outcome in patients with cancer. Cancer patients who received systemic treatment within 28 days had an OR for mortality of 4.05 (95% CI 0.68\u201323.95), p = 0.12. On presentation anaemia, hypokalaemia, hypoalbuminaemia and hypoproteinaemia were identified predominantly in cohort A. Median duration of admission was 8 days for cancer patients and 7 days for non-cancer. Conclusion: A diagnosis of cancer does not appear to increase the risk of death or a severe outcome in COVID-19 patients with cancer compared with those without cancer. If a second spike of virus strikes, rational decision making is required to ensure optimal cancer care.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cancer pathways", "cancer patients", "chemotherapy", "COVID-19", "pandemic"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090946346", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"57211193190": {"Name": "Joharatnam-Hogan N.", "AuthorID": "57211193190", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC CTU UCL"}, "6701713285": {"Name": "Hochhauser D.", "AuthorID": "6701713285", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57201059603": {"Name": "Shiu K.K.", "AuthorID": "57201059603", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7003634798": {"Name": "Bridgewater J.", "AuthorID": "7003634798", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57220375070": {"Name": "Rush H.", "AuthorID": "57220375070", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57202134241": {"Name": "Crolley V.", "AuthorID": "57202134241", "AffiliationID": "60031025", "AffiliationName": "North Middlesex University Hospital"}, "57219002734": {"Name": "Kantser G.", "AuthorID": "57219002734", "AffiliationID": "60031025", "AffiliationName": "North Middlesex University Hospital"}, "57218992030": {"Name": "Saha A.", "AuthorID": "57218992030", "AffiliationID": "60031025", "AffiliationName": "North Middlesex University Hospital"}, "15842288900": {"Name": "Raja F.", "AuthorID": "15842288900", "AffiliationID": "60031025", "AffiliationName": "North Middlesex University Hospital"}, "57218990179": {"Name": "Wilson W.", "AuthorID": "57218990179", "AffiliationID": "60012754, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK and UCL Cancer Trials Centre"}, "55482789500": {"Name": "Sharma A.", "AuthorID": "55482789500", "AffiliationID": "60006776", "AffiliationName": "Mount Vernon Hospital"}, "57220606509": {"Name": "Muhammad A.", "AuthorID": "57220606509", "AffiliationID": "60000641", "AffiliationName": "Whittington Hospital"}, "57220655200": {"Name": "Anwar M.", "AuthorID": "57220655200", "AffiliationID": "60006592", "AffiliationName": "Princess Alexandra Hospital"}, "24492450100": {"Name": "Vasdev N.", "AuthorID": "24492450100", "AffiliationID": "60027616", "AffiliationName": "Lister Hospital (East and North Herts NHS Trust)"}, "57218880022": {"Name": "Goldstein R.", "AuthorID": "57218880022", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free Hospital"}, "55549880600": {"Name": "Khan K.", "AuthorID": "55549880600", "AffiliationID": "60031025, 60024544, 60109234", "AffiliationName": "Gastrointestinal Oncology Service and Cancer of Unknown Primary Service; University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Cancer Institute and North Middlesex University Hospital, GI Cancer Lead North London Cancer Research Netword, and Oncology Research Lead North Middlesex University Hospital"}}}
