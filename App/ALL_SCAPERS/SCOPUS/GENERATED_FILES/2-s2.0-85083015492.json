Advances in cardiac imaging and the introduction of genetics into everyday practice have revealed that AC comprises multiple phenotypes that are dependent on genetic or acquired factors. In this study, the authors summarise the approach to the identification of the AC phenotype and its underlying causes. They believe that AC represents a paradigm for personalised medicine in cardiology and that better stratification of the disease will enhance the development of mechanism-based treatments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy", "Disease", "Genetics", "Phenotype", "Treatment"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083015492", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"55567498200": {"Name": "Protonotarios A.", "AuthorID": "55567498200", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Cardiovascular Disease Unit, Barts Heart Centre"}, "57202356433": {"Name": "Elliott P.M.", "AuthorID": "57202356433", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Cardiovascular Disease Unit, Barts Heart Centre"}}}
