Therefore, a blood-based marker for such pathophysiology would have greater utility in a primary care setting and in eligibility screening for clinical trials. Rapid advances in ultra-sensitive assays have enabled the levels of pathological proteins to be measured in blood samples, but research has been predominantly focused on Alzheimer disease (AD). Nonetheless, proteins that were identified as potential blood-based biomarkers for AD, for example, amyloid-\u03b2, tau, phosphorylated tau and neurofilament light chain, are likely to be relevant to other neurodegenerative disorders that involve similar pathological processes and could also be useful for the differential diagnosis of clinical symptoms. This Review outlines the neuropathological, clinical, molecular imaging and cerebrospinal fluid features of the most common neurodegenerative disorders outside the AD continuum and gives an overview of the current status of blood-based biomarkers for these disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084051209", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"55498735800": {"Name": "Ashton N.J.", "AuthorID": "55498735800", "AffiliationID": "60028884, 60171762", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Mental Health & Biomedical Research Unit for Dementia at South London & Maudsley NHS Foundation"}, "24469026000": {"Name": "Su\u00e1rez-Calvet M.", "AuthorID": "24469026000", "AffiliationID": "60023506", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Hospital del Mar"}, "56609310200": {"Name": "Karikari T.K.", "AuthorID": "56609310200", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience & Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg"}, "35070295800": {"Name": "Sch\u00f6ll M.", "AuthorID": "35070295800", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55883397700": {"Name": "H\u00f6glund K.", "AuthorID": "55883397700", "AffiliationID": "60006681, 60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Center for Alzheimer Disease Research, Neurogeriatrics Division, Karolinska Institutet, Novum, Huddinge"}, "7101909602": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "7101909602", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "57208899083": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "57208899083", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL"}, "6603434972": {"Name": "Hye A.", "AuthorID": "6603434972", "AffiliationID": "60028884, 60171762", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Mental Health & Biomedical Research Unit for Dementia at South London & Maudsley NHS Foundation"}, "16242385200": {"Name": "Rajkumar A.P.", "AuthorID": "16242385200", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60172395", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Mental Health, University of Nottingham"}, "54886907000": {"Name": "Hortob\u00e1gyi T.", "AuthorID": "54886907000", "AffiliationID": "60004400, 60108571", "AffiliationName": "MTA-DE Cerebrovascular and Neurodegenerative Research Group, Department of Neurology, University of Debrecen"}, "7004099018": {"Name": "Svenningsson P.", "AuthorID": "7004099018", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet"}, "56222844000": {"Name": "Aarsland D.", "AuthorID": "56222844000", "AffiliationID": "60069103", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Age-Related Medicine, Stavanger University Hospital"}, "35484474600": {"Name": "Leuzy A.", "AuthorID": "35484474600", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Memory Research Unit, Lund University"}, "55387188900": {"Name": "Snowden S.", "AuthorID": "55387188900", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60120909", "AffiliationName": "Core Metabolomics and Lipidomics Laboratory, Metabolic Research Laboratories, Institute of Metabolic Science, University of Cambridge, Cambridge Biomedical Campus"}, "36163258500": {"Name": "La Joie R.", "AuthorID": "36163258500", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Memory and Aging Center, University of California, San Francisco"}, "56084814900": {"Name": "Rabinovici G.D.", "AuthorID": "56084814900", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Memory and Aging Center, University of California, San Francisco"}, "35351371500": {"Name": "Ballard C.", "AuthorID": "35351371500", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Medical School, University of Exeter"}}}
