In that context, the ecological filter is an alternative for treating water for human consumption. Some studies show that climate change and meteorological parameters can influence the water quality of water bodies and the water supply system. However, most of the papers deal with model projections and therefore do not show real situations. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of meteorological variables (e.g. atmospheric pressure, evaporation, wind speed, radiation, precipitation) on the physico-chemical and biological parameters (e.g. turbidity, apparent colour, pH, total coliforms, Escherichia coli) of Lobo reservoir water treated by 22 ecological filters during a period of 4 months. Statistically significant correlations were found between the water from the Lobo reservoir and the weather variables, and between the water quality parameters of the 22 ecological filters and the average weather variables. The results from the statistical analysis indicate that climatic variations may influence treatment performance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ecological filtration", "Meteorological conditions", "Water quality parameters", "Water treatment"], "IndexKeywords": ["Climatic variation", "Low cost technology", "Meteorological condition", "Meteorological parameters", "Meteorological variables", "Remote communities", "Treatment performance", "Water quality parameters"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074391980", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"57192956233": {"Name": "Pompei C.M.E.", "AuthorID": "57192956233", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Water Resources and Applied Ecology Center, S\u00e3o Carlos School of Engineering, University of S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "54683303400": {"Name": "Alves E.D.L.", "AuthorID": "54683303400", "AffiliationID": "60101675", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Federal de Educa\u00e7\u00e3o, Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia Goiano, Campus Ceres"}, "7102986924": {"Name": "Vieira E.M.", "AuthorID": "7102986924", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Molecular Physics, S\u00e3o Carlos Institute of Chemistry, University of S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "14043273200": {"Name": "Campos L.C.", "AuthorID": "14043273200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
