Review of Development Economics published by John Wiley & Sons LtdHow persistent are teacher effects on student outcomes? In this paper we present estimates of teacher effects on long-run student outcomes from two low- and middle- income countries. We first estimate teacher value-added using the Young Lives School Survey data from Ethiopia and Vietnam. We then track students taught by these teachers 2 and 5 years later and use data from the Young Lives Household Surveys to estimate the effects of teacher quality. We find no persistent effect after 2 years, but better mathematics (0.08\u03c3) and reading (0.06\u03c3) test scores after 5 years, from being taught by a 1\u03c3 better Grade 5 teacher. We find no persistent effects of good teachers on measures of more \u201cgeneralized\u201d cognitive ability, aspirations, well-being, or \u201cgrit.\u201d.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ethiopia", "learning", "teachers", "value-added", "Vietnam"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091023697", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Development", "SOCI", "3303"]], "AuthorData": {"57201289953": {"Name": "Crawfurd L.", "AuthorID": "57201289953", "AffiliationID": "113367116", "AffiliationName": "Center for Global Development"}, "16234808800": {"Name": "Rolleston C.", "AuthorID": "16234808800", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}}}
