Methods: Outcomes following placement of stents in consecutive patients under 18 years at a single center from 2003 to 2018 were reviewed. A PRISMA-guided systematic review was conducted identifying studies with 5 or more children evaluating self-expanding stents published from 1975 to 2018. Endpoints for both the retrospective and systematic reviews were the requirement for further intervention and stent-associated complications. Results: 25 patients received 65 stents. There were 12 caustic injury-related strictures (48%), 9 anastomotic strictures (36%), and 4 esophagitis-related strictures (16%). Four patients were lost to follow-up. 19/21 patients (90%) required further intervention, and 8/21 (38%) had esophageal replacement. Nine studies, all case series, were included in the systematic review. 97 patients received 160 stents for esophageal strictures and/or perforation. 36 out of 69 patients (52%) with strictures required no further treatment post-stenting, and 22/29 (76%) of esophageal perforations closed with stenting. Conclusions: Esophageal stents may have a role as a bridge to definitive surgery and for the management of esophageal leaks, but complete stricture resolution post-stenting is unlikely.
