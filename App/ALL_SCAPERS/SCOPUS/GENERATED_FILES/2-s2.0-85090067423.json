Although not electrically excitable, astrocytes display a complex repertoire of intracellular Ca2+ signalling that evolves in space and time within single astrocytes and across astrocytic networks. Decoding the physiological meaning of these dynamic changes in astrocytic Ca2+ activity has remained a major challenge. This Review describes experimental preparations and methods for recording and studying Ca2+ activity in astrocytes, focusing on the analysis of Ca2+ signalling events in single astrocytes and in astrocytic networks. The limitations of existing experimental approaches and ongoing technical and conceptual challenges in the interpretation of astrocytic Ca2+ events and their spatio-temporal patterns are also discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Astrocytes", "Brain", "Calcium Signaling", "Cells, Cultured", "Humans", "Neurons", "Optical Imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090067423", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"6603200267": {"Name": "Semyanov A.", "AuthorID": "6603200267", "AffiliationID": "60010188", "AffiliationName": "Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University"}, "8694890100": {"Name": "Henneberger C.", "AuthorID": "8694890100", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}, "24597650300": {"Name": "Agarwal A.", "AuthorID": "24597650300", "AffiliationID": "60016908", "AffiliationName": "Interdisciplinary Center for Neurosciences, Heidelberg University"}}}
