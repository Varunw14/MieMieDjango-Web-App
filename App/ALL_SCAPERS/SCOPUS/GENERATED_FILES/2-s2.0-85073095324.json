Additionally, previous studies have been underpowered to robustly assess heterogeneity of effects on kidney outcomes by different levels of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria. We aimed to do a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on major kidney outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes and to determine the consistency of effect size across trials and different levels of eGFR and albuminuria. Methods: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised, controlled, cardiovascular or kidney outcome trials of SGLT2 inhibitors that reported effects on major kidney outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes. We searched MEDLINE and Embase from database inception to June 14, 2019, to identify eligible trials. The primary outcome was a composite of dialysis, transplantation, or death due to kidney disease. We used random-effects models to obtain summary relative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs and random-effects meta-regression to explore effect modification by subgroups of baseline eGFR, albuminuria, and use of renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS) blockade. This review is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019131774). Findings: From 2085 records identified, four studies met our inclusion criteria, assessing three SGLT2 inhibitors: empagliflozin (EMPA-REG OUTCOME), canagliflozin (CANVAS Program and CREDENCE), and dapagliflozin (DECLARE\u2013TIMI 58). From a total of 38 723 participants, 252 required dialysis or transplantation or died of kidney disease, 335 developed end-stage kidney disease, and 943 had acute kidney injury. SGLT2 inhibitors substantially reduced the risk of dialysis, transplantation, or death due to kidney disease (RR 0\u00b767, 95% CI 0\u00b752\u20130\u00b786, p=0\u00b70019), an effect consistent across studies (I2=0%, pheterogeneity=0\u00b753). SGLT2 inhibitors also reduced end-stage kidney disease (0\u00b765, 0\u00b753\u20130\u00b781, p<0\u00b70001), and acute kidney injury (0\u00b775, 0\u00b766\u20130\u00b785, p<0\u00b70001), with consistent benefits across studies. Although we identified some evidence that the proportional effect of SGLT2 inhibitors might attenuate with declining kidney function (ptrend=0\u00b7073), there was clear, separate evidence of benefit for all eGFR subgroups, including for participants with a baseline eGFR 30\u201345 mL/min per 1\u00b773 m2 (RR 0\u00b770, 95% CI 0\u00b754\u20130\u00b791, p=0\u00b70080). Renoprotection was also consistent across studies irrespective of baseline albuminuria (ptrend=0\u00b766) and use of RAS blockade (pheterogeneity=0\u00b731). Interpretation: SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of dialysis, transplantation, or death due to kidney disease in individuals with type 2 diabetes and provided protection against acute kidney injury. These data provide substantive evidence supporting the use of SGLT2 inhibitors to prevent major kidney outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes.
