However, tissue damage is assessed qualitatively with little information regarding the underlying pathophysiological processes involved. Magnetisation transfer ratio (MTR) is a quantitative magnetic resonance imaging method which is sensitive to tissue macromolecular content and may therefore have an important role in the study of pathologies affecting the PNS. This study explored the feasibility of obtaining reliable MTR measurements in the proximal lumbar plexus of healthy volunteers using MRN to identify and segment each lumbar segment (L2\u2013L5) and regions (preganglionic, ganglionic and postganglionic). Reproducibility of the MTR measurements and of the segmentation method were assessed from repeated measurements (scan-rescan), and from the reanalysis of images (intra- and inter-rater assessment), by calculating the coefficient of variation (COV). In all segments combined (L2\u2013L5), mean (\u00b1 SD) MTR was 30.5 (\u00b1 2.4). Scan-rescan, intra- and inter-rater COV values were 3.2%, 4.4% and 5.3%, respectively. One-way analysis of variance revealed a statistically significant difference in MTR between the preganglionic and postganglionic regions in all lumbar segments. This pilot study in healthy volunteers demonstrates the feasibility of obtaining reliable MTR measurements in the proximal lumbar plexus, opening up the possibility of studying a broad spectrum of neurological conditions in vivo.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Analysis of Variance", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Healthy Volunteers", "Humans", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Lumbosacral Plexus", "Lumbosacral Region", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pilot Projects", "Reproducibility of Results"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090159679", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"8833938100": {"Name": "Yiannakas M.C.", "AuthorID": "8833938100", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "NMR Research Unit, Queen Square MS Centre, Department of Neuroinflammation, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "57218119749": {"Name": "Aforlabi-Logoh I.", "AuthorID": "57218119749", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "NMR Research Unit, Queen Square MS Centre, Department of Neuroinflammation, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "57193550334": {"Name": "Prados F.", "AuthorID": "57193550334", "AffiliationID": "60002581", "AffiliationName": "e-Health Centre, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya"}, "7003671038": {"Name": "Ciccarelli O.", "AuthorID": "7003671038", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "NMR Research Unit, Queen Square MS Centre, Department of Neuroinflammation, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "57218506443": {"Name": "Wheeler-Kingshott C.A.M.", "AuthorID": "57218506443", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain and Behavioural Sciences, University of Pavia"}, "36622407700": {"Name": "Schneider T.", "AuthorID": "36622407700", "AffiliationID": "60106716", "AffiliationName": "Philips Healthcare"}, "55251486700": {"Name": "Yoneyama M.", "AuthorID": "55251486700", "AffiliationID": "60021681", "AffiliationName": "Philips Japan"}}}
