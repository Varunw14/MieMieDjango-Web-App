This work investigated the effects of the passive viewing of different facial expressions on face M1 and compared data with those obtained from the hand M1. Thirty healthy subjects were randomly assigned to two groups undergoing transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of face or hand M1. In both groups, short-latency intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) were probed in the depressor anguli oris (DAO) and first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscles 300 ms after presentation of a picture of a face that expressed happy, sad or neutral emotions. Statistical analysis of SICI showed a non-significant effect of muscle (F1,28 = 1.903, p = 0.179), but a significant effect of emotion (F2,56 = 6.860, p = 0.004) and a significant interaction between muscle and emotion (F2,56 = 5.072, p = 0.015). Post hoc analysis showed that there was a significant reduction of SICI in the DAO muscle after presentation of a face with a happy expression compared with a neutral face (p < 0.001). In the FDI, a significant difference was observed between neutral and sad expressions (p = 0.010) No clear differences in ICF were detected. The different responses of face and hand muscles to emotional stimuli may be due to their functional roles in emotional expression versus protection of the body.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Emotional motor control", "Face expressions", "Face primary motor cortex", "Hand primary motor cortex", "TMS", "Volitional motor control"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cortical Excitability", "Emotions", "Facial Expression", "Facial Muscles", "Facial Recognition", "Female", "Hand", "Humans", "Male", "Motor Cortex", "Mouth", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Neural Inhibition", "Neurons", "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082123601", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"55982479700": {"Name": "Ginatempo F.", "AuthorID": "55982479700", "AffiliationID": "60010110", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sassari"}, "6603706285": {"Name": "Deriu F.", "AuthorID": "6603706285", "AffiliationID": "60010110", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sassari"}, "56533879100": {"Name": "Manzo N.", "AuthorID": "56533879100", "AffiliationID": "60023773", "AffiliationName": "IRCCS NEUROMED"}, "57212057392": {"Name": "Ibanez-Pereda J.", "AuthorID": "57212057392", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering, Faculty of Engineering, Imperial College"}, "7003942045": {"Name": "Rocchi L.", "AuthorID": "7003942045", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55455767400": {"Name": "Rothwell J.C.", "AuthorID": "55455767400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
