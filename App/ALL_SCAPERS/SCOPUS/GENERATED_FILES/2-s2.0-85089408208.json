Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.(1) Background: Malnutrition in cancer patients impacts quality of life (QoL) and performance status (PS). When oral/enteral nutrition is not possible and patients develop intestinal failure, parenteral nutrition (PN) is indicated. Our aim was to assess nutritional status, QoL, and PS in hospitalised cancer patients recently initiated on PN for intestinal failure. (2) Methods: The design was a cross-sectional observational study. The following information was captured: demographic, anthropometric, biochemical and medical information, as well as nutritional screening tool (NST), patient-generated subjective global assessment (PG-SGA), functional assessment of cancer therapy-general (FACT-G), and Karnofsky PS (KPS) data. (3) Results: Among 85 PN referrals, 30 oncology patients (56.2 years, 56.7% male) were identified. Mean weight (60.3 \u00b1 16.6 kg) corresponded to normal body mass index values (21.0 \u00b1 5.1 kg/m2). However, weight loss was significant in patients with gastrointestinal tumours (p < 0.01). A high malnutrition risk was present in 53.3\u201356.7% of patients, depending on the screening tool. Patients had impaired QoL (FACT-G: 26.6 \u00b1 9.8) but PS indicated above average capability with independent daily activities (KPS: 60 \u00b1 10). (4) Conclusions: Future research should assess the impact of impaired NS and QoL on clinical outcomes such as survival, with a view to encompassing nutritional and QoL assessment in the management pathway of this patient group.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Advanced cancer", "Nutrition", "Oncology", "Parenteral nutrition", "Quality of life"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089408208", "SubjectAreas": [["Food Science", "AGRI", "1106"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"57220096111": {"Name": "Plyta M.", "AuthorID": "57220096111", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "35316524300": {"Name": "Patel P.S.", "AuthorID": "35316524300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Intestinal Failure Service, Department of Gastroenterology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57215505554": {"Name": "Fragkos K.C.", "AuthorID": "57215505554", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Intestinal Failure Service, Department of Gastroenterology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56402425500": {"Name": "Mehta S.", "AuthorID": "56402425500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "12647293500": {"Name": "Rahman F.", "AuthorID": "12647293500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "57218902058": {"Name": "Caro S.D.", "AuthorID": "57218902058", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "57198862233": {"Name": "Kumagai T.", "AuthorID": "57198862233", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London"}}}
