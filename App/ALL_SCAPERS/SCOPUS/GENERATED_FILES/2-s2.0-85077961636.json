Here, we present InAs/GaAs quantum dots microdisk lasers monolithically grown on on-axis Si (001) substrate with ultra-low lasing threshold under room-temperature continues-wave optical pumping. The promising lasing characteristics of the microdisk lasers with ultra-low threshold and small footprint represent a major advance towards large-scale, low-cost integration of laser sources on silicon-based platform.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Microdisk laser", "photonic integrated circuits", "ultra-low threshold"], "IndexKeywords": ["InAs/GaAs quantum dots", "Lasing characteristics", "Low cost integration", "Microdisk laser", "Monolithic integration", "Photonic integrated circuits", "Si (001) substrate", "Ultra-low threshold"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077961636", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57194282066": {"Name": "Zhou T.", "AuthorID": "57194282066", "AffiliationID": "60108865", "AffiliationName": "School of Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong"}, "57203338209": {"Name": "Xiang G.", "AuthorID": "57203338209", "AffiliationID": "60108865", "AffiliationName": "School of Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong"}, "55608846700": {"Name": "Zhang Z.", "AuthorID": "55608846700", "AffiliationID": "60108865", "AffiliationName": "School of Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong"}, "55365959800": {"Name": "Tang M.", "AuthorID": "55365959800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "54939079100": {"Name": "Chen S.", "AuthorID": "54939079100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "15765485000": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "15765485000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
