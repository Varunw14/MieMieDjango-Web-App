Method Ten participants, at Hoehn and Yahr stage 4 or 5, were interviewed using semi-structured open-ended questions. Data were analysed using qualitative thematic analysis. Findings Participants reported that whilst under the treatment of specialist hospitals, the majority of care provision had shifted into the community, often because hospital-based services were felt to be difficult to access and have limited benefit to them. When using health-care services, participants frequently experienced having to 'fit-in' to service structures that did not always accommodate their complex needs. Despite high levels of disability, participants expressed their desire to maintain their identity, normality of interests and activities in their lives, including remaining in their own homes. This was facilitated by bespoke care and equipment, and positive relationships with care providers. Knowledge on disease management was a key factor in their perceived ability to remain in control. Family caregivers had a central role in facilitating care at home. There was uncertainty about and little planning for the future, and moving to a residential nursing home was perceived an undesirable but potentially necessary option for future care. Conclusion Unmet care needs identified by people with late stage Parkinson's in England include greater flexibility of healthcare structures and bespoke service provision, to accommodate their individual complex needs. Support in their own homes and positive relationships with healthcare providers help People with Parkinson's (PwP) to maintain a degree of normality and identity, and provision of information help them maintain some control. There is a need for more informed discussions on future care planning for this specific population.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Caregivers", "Delivery of Health Care", "England", "Female", "Health Personnel", "Health Services", "Humans", "Male", "Parkinson Disease", "Patient Reported Outcome Measures", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077335483", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"36097231400": {"Name": "Read J.", "AuthorID": "36097231400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57212673033": {"Name": "Cable S.", "AuthorID": "57212673033", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57196036609": {"Name": "Bartl G.", "AuthorID": "57196036609", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "55802371060": {"Name": "Schrag A.", "AuthorID": "55802371060", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "11241143800": {"Name": "L\u00f6fqvist C.", "AuthorID": "11241143800", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, Lund University"}, "26643085000": {"Name": "Iwarsson S.", "AuthorID": "26643085000", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, Lund University"}}}
