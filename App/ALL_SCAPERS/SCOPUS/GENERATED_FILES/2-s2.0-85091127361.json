However, the complicated preparation and systemic toxicity to living systems prevent them from translation to clinical applications. In the present report, we developed a polyepicatechin-based on/off switchable ultra-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) visible theranostic nanoparticle (PEMN) for image-guided photothermal therapy (PTT) using our strategy of integrating polymerization and biomineralization into the protein template. We have exploited natural polyphenols as the near infra-red (NIR) switchable photothermal source and MnO2 for the MRI-guided theranostics. PEMN demonstrates excellent MRI contrast ability with a longitudinal relaxivity value up to 30.01 mM-1 s-1. PEMN has shown great tumor inhibition on orthotopic breast tumors and the treatment could be made switchable with an on/off interchangeable mode as needed. PEMN was found to be excretable mainly through the kidneys, avoiding potential systemic toxicity. Thus, PEMN could be extremely useful for developing on-demand therapeutics via 'see it and treat it' means with distinguished MRI capability and on/off switchable photothermal properties.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Clinical application", "Nanotheranostics", "Photothermal properties", "Photothermal therapy", "Preclinical development", "Protein templates", "Remarkable impact", "Systemic toxicities"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091127361", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57204148542": {"Name": "Xiao B.", "AuthorID": "57204148542", "AffiliationID": "60003970", "AffiliationName": "College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University"}, "37118224200": {"Name": "Xu H.", "AuthorID": "37118224200", "AffiliationID": "60117840, 60003970, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Biomass Chemical Engineering, Ministry of Education, Center for Bionanoengineering, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University"}, "57221430387": {"Name": "Zhang W.", "AuthorID": "57221430387", "AffiliationID": "60117840, 60003970, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Biomass Chemical Engineering, Ministry of Education, Center for Bionanoengineering, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University"}, "57219048012": {"Name": "Xu X.", "AuthorID": "57219048012", "AffiliationID": "60117840, 60003970, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Biomass Chemical Engineering, Ministry of Education, Center for Bionanoengineering, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University"}, "8869352800": {"Name": "Zhou Z.", "AuthorID": "8869352800", "AffiliationID": "60117840, 60003970, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Biomass Chemical Engineering, Ministry of Education, Center for Bionanoengineering, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University"}, "56045984600": {"Name": "Liu X.", "AuthorID": "56045984600", "AffiliationID": "60117840, 60003970, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Biomass Chemical Engineering, Ministry of Education, Center for Bionanoengineering, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University"}, "8639064500": {"Name": "Tang J.", "AuthorID": "8639064500", "AffiliationID": "60117840, 60003970, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Biomass Chemical Engineering, Ministry of Education, Center for Bionanoengineering, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University"}, "7404766582": {"Name": "Shen Y.", "AuthorID": "7404766582", "AffiliationID": "60117840, 60003970, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Biomass Chemical Engineering, Ministry of Education, Center for Bionanoengineering, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University"}, "7404475089": {"Name": "Gao J.", "AuthorID": "7404475089", "AffiliationID": "60003970", "AffiliationName": "College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University"}, "57191627775": {"Name": "Zhou X.", "AuthorID": "57191627775", "AffiliationID": "60118427, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital (SRRSH), School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"}, "57219048369": {"Name": "Tian F.", "AuthorID": "57219048369", "AffiliationID": "60118427, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital (SRRSH), School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"}, "55307475000": {"Name": "Qian Y.", "AuthorID": "55307475000", "AffiliationID": "60118427, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital (SRRSH), School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"}, "57204278672": {"Name": "Yu F.", "AuthorID": "57204278672", "AffiliationID": "60118427, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital (SRRSH), School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"}, "57215327630": {"Name": "Pu C.", "AuthorID": "57215327630", "AffiliationID": "60118427, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital (SRRSH), School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"}, "15843465600": {"Name": "Hu H.", "AuthorID": "15843465600", "AffiliationID": "60118427, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital (SRRSH), School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"}, "14067825400": {"Name": "Patra H.K.", "AuthorID": "14067825400", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Cambridge"}, "23028495000": {"Name": "Slater N.", "AuthorID": "23028495000", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Cambridge"}}}
