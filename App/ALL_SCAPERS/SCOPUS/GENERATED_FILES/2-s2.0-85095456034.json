We present a detailed study of the role of spin symmetry in determining the demagnetizing factor of cuboids, focusing, as a model example, on the Ising dipolar ferromagnet LiHoF4. We distinguish two different functions: The demagnetizing factor as a function of intrinsic susceptibility N(\u03c7) and the demagnetizing factor as a function of temperature N(T). For a given nonellipsoidal sample, the function N(\u03c7) depends only on dipolar terms in the spin Hamiltonian, but apart from in the limits \u03c70 and \u03c7 it is a different function for different spin symmetries. The function N(T) is less universal, depending on exchange terms and other details of the spin Hamiltonian. We apply a recent theory to calculate these functions for spherical and cuboidal samples of LiHoF4. The theoretical results are compared with N(\u03c7) and N(T) derived from experimental measurements of the magnetic susceptibility of corresponding samples of LiHoF4, both above and below its ferromagnetic transition at Tc=1.53 K. Close agreement between theory and experiment is demonstrated, showing that the intrinsic susceptibility of LiHoF4 and other strongly magnetic systems can be accurately estimated from measurements on cuboidal samples. Our results further show that for cuboids, and implicitly for any sample shape, N(\u03c7) below the ordering transition takes the value N(\u221e). This confirms and extends the scope of earlier observations that the intrinsic susceptibility of ferromagnets remains divergent below the transition, in contradiction to the implications of broken symmetry. We discuss the topological and microscopic origins of this result.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Broken symmetry", "Demagnetizing factors", "Ferromagnetic transitions", "Magnetic system", "Measurements of", "Ordering transitions", "Spin hamiltonian", "Spin symmetry"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095456034", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57202194317": {"Name": "Twengstr\u00f6m M.", "AuthorID": "57202194317", "AffiliationID": "60002014", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Royal Institute of Technology"}, "6507947027": {"Name": "Henelius P.", "AuthorID": "6507947027", "AffiliationID": "60015375", "AffiliationName": "\u00c5bo Akademi University"}, "32667481600": {"Name": "Bovo L.", "AuthorID": "32667481600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Innovation and Enterprise, University College London"}, "7006543434": {"Name": "Bramwell S.T.", "AuthorID": "7006543434", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7006410897": {"Name": "Petrenko O.A.", "AuthorID": "7006410897", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}}}
