Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of the Women, Gender, and Politics Research Section of the American Political Science Association.The COVID-19 pandemic has gendered implications for women's time and resources. The use of informal institutions that pose obstacles to women's electoral viability may also be particularly consequential at a time of rapid change, when election dates and procedures are being amended because of health concerns. Together, these dynamics suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic may impact women's electoral participation, support, and viability in meaningful ways. The November 2020 Brazilian municipal elections provide an opportunity to explore this. Employing data from an original survey of eligible individuals and aspirant candidates, we find that the main obstacle to women's representation is not personal political ambition or efforts but women's perceptions of their access to support for their candidacies. In the face of greater challenges, resilient aspirants are choosing to work harder to compensate for potential losses in campaign support and funds.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brazil", "candidate recruitment", "COVID-19", "elections", "women's representation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096126273", "SubjectAreas": [["Gender Studies", "SOCI", "3318"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"57189243553": {"Name": "Gatto M.A.C.", "AuthorID": "57189243553", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Latin American Politics, Institute of the Americas, University College London"}, "57211916020": {"Name": "Thome D.", "AuthorID": "57211916020", "AffiliationID": "60001865", "AffiliationName": "LabGen, Universidade Federal Fluminense"}}}
