All rights reserved.Background This study aimed to assess the prevalence and causes of vision loss in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in 2015, compared with prior years, and to estimate expected values for 2020. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the prevalence of blindness (presenting distance visual acuity <3/60 in the better eye), moderate and severe vision impairment (MSVI; presenting distance visual acuity <6/18 but \u22653/60) and mild vision impairment (MVI; presenting distance visual acuity <6/12 and \u22656/18), and also near vision impairment (<N6 or N8 in the presence of \u22656/12 best-corrected distance visual acuity) in SSA for 1990, 2010, 2015 and 2020. In SSA, age-standardised prevalence of blindness, MSVI and MVI in 2015 were 1.03% (80% uncertainty interval (UI) 0.39-1.81), 3.64% (80% UI 1.71-5.94) and 2.94% (80% UI 1.05-5.34), respectively, for male and 1.08% (80% UI 0.40-1.93), 3.84% (80% UI 1.72-6.37) and 3.06% (80% UI 1.07-5.61) for females, constituting a significant decrease since 2010 for both genders. There were an estimated 4.28 million blind individuals and 17.36 million individuals with MSVI; 101.08 million individuals were estimated to have near vision loss due to presbyopia. Cataract was the most common cause of blindness (40.1%), whereas undercorrected refractive error (URE) (48.5%) was the most common cause of MSVI. Sub-Saharan West Africa had the highest proportion of blindness compared with the other SSA subregions. Conclusions Cataract and URE, two of the major causes of blindness and vision impairment, are reversible with treatment and thus promising targets to alleviate vision impairment in SSA.", "AuthorKeywords": ["epidemiology", "public health"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084749242", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"35564549000": {"Name": "Naidoo K.", "AuthorID": "35564549000", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Optometry and Vision Science, University of New South Wales"}, "6507557960": {"Name": "Tahhan N.", "AuthorID": "6507557960", "AffiliationID": "60136196", "AffiliationName": "Brien Holden Vision Institute"}, "6603842682": {"Name": "Kempen J.H.", "AuthorID": "6603842682", "AffiliationID": "60077515", "AffiliationName": "Mcm Eye Unit, MyungSung Christian Medical Center, Medical School"}, "25227326200": {"Name": "Gichuhi S.", "AuthorID": "25227326200", "AffiliationID": "60048717", "AffiliationName": "Ophthalmology, University of Nairobi"}, "55522947000": {"Name": "Braithwaite T.", "AuthorID": "55522947000", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuro-Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital Nhs Foundation Trust"}, "7004576721": {"Name": "Pesudovs K.", "AuthorID": "7004576721", "AffiliationID": "60136196", "AffiliationName": "Brien Holden Vision Institute"}, "7103377631": {"Name": "Bourne R.R.A.", "AuthorID": "7103377631", "AffiliationID": "60000913", "AffiliationName": "Vision and Eye Research Unit (VERI), Anglia Ruskin University"}, "6603840796": {"Name": "Casson R.J.", "AuthorID": "6603840796", "AffiliationID": "60009512", "AffiliationName": "South Australia Institute of Ophthalmology, University of Adelaide"}, "37260895200": {"Name": "Cicinelli M.V.", "AuthorID": "37260895200", "AffiliationID": "60009622, 60082964", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University Vita-Salute, San Raffaele Hospital"}, "57195264481": {"Name": "Das A.", "AuthorID": "57195264481", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Health Education Yorkshire and the Humber"}, "35190257400": {"Name": "Flaxman S.R.", "AuthorID": "35190257400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Data Science Institute, Imperial College London, London"}, "57215380211": {"Name": "Jonas J.B.", "AuthorID": "57215380211", "AffiliationID": "60016908", "AffiliationName": "Ruprecht-Karls-University Heidelberg, Seegartenklinik Heidelberg, Department of Ophthalmology"}, "7003387114": {"Name": "Keeffe J.E.", "AuthorID": "7003387114", "AffiliationID": "60020023", "AffiliationName": "Gullapalli Pratibha Rao International Centre for Advancement of Rural Eye Care, L v Prasad Eye Institute"}, "57197789738": {"Name": "Leasher J.", "AuthorID": "57197789738", "AffiliationID": "60019600", "AffiliationName": "HPD/College of Optometry, Nova Southeastern University"}, "7003274856": {"Name": "Limburg H.", "AuthorID": "7003274856", "AffiliationID": "109545922", "AffiliationName": "Health Information Services"}, "7006012071": {"Name": "Resnikoff S.", "AuthorID": "7006012071", "AffiliationID": "60136196", "AffiliationName": "Brien Holden Vision Institute"}, "33068382100": {"Name": "Silvester A.J.", "AuthorID": "33068382100", "AffiliationID": "60023925", "AffiliationName": "Ophthalmology, Royal Liverpool University Hospital"}, "57203677366": {"Name": "Taylor H.R.", "AuthorID": "57203677366", "AffiliationID": "60118547, 60026553", "AffiliationName": "Melbourne School of Population Health, University of Melbourne"}, "7403147159": {"Name": "Wong T.Y.", "AuthorID": "7403147159", "AffiliationID": "60024285, 60008970", "AffiliationName": "Glaucoma, Singapore National Eye Centre, Singapore Eye Research Institute"}}}
