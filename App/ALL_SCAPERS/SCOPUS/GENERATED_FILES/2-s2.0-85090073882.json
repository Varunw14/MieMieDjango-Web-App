The smaller \u201cbluestones\u201d near the center of the monument have been traced to Wales, but the origins of the sarsen (silcrete) megaliths that form the primary architecture of Stonehenge remain unknown. Here, we use geochemical data to show that 50 of the 52 sarsens at the monument share a consistent chemistry and, by inference, originated from a common source area. We then compare the geochemical signature of a core extracted from Stone 58 at Stonehenge with equivalent data for sarsens from across southern Britain. From this, we identify West Woods, Wiltshire, 25 km north of Stonehenge, as the most probable source area for the majority of sarsens at the monument.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Britain", "Common source", "Geochemical data", "Geochemical signatures", "Silcretes", "Source area", "Stonehenge"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090073882", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"7201462012": {"Name": "Nash D.J.", "AuthorID": "7201462012", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Archaeology and Environmental Studies, University of the Witwatersrand"}, "57219119552": {"Name": "Ciborowski J.R.T.", "AuthorID": "57219119552", "AffiliationID": "60007919", "AffiliationName": "School of Environment and Technology, University of Brighton"}, "14918899600": {"Name": "Stewart Ullyott J.", "AuthorID": "14918899600", "AffiliationID": "60007919", "AffiliationName": "School of Environment and Technology, University of Brighton"}, "57190377515": {"Name": "Maniatis G.", "AuthorID": "57190377515", "AffiliationID": "60007919", "AffiliationName": "School of Environment and Technology, University of Brighton"}, "8836086000": {"Name": "Pearson M.P.", "AuthorID": "8836086000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "6602088216": {"Name": "Darvill T.", "AuthorID": "6602088216", "AffiliationID": "60029336", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology and Anthropology, Bournemouth University"}, "57218585438": {"Name": "Greaney S.", "AuthorID": "57218585438", "AffiliationID": "60113093", "AffiliationName": "English Heritage"}, "57205390202": {"Name": "Whitaker K.A.", "AuthorID": "57205390202", "AffiliationID": "60111436", "AffiliationName": "Historic England"}}}
