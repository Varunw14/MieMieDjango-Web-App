Current methods to detect resistance include phenotypic antibiotic sensitivity testing (AST), which measures bacterial growth and is therefore hampered by a slow time to obtain results (\u223c12-24 h). Therefore, new rapid phenotypic methods for AST are urgently needed. Nanomechanical cantilever sensors have recently shown promise for rapid AST but challenges of bacterial immobilization can lead to variable results. Herein, a novel cantilever-based method is described for detecting phenotypic antibiotic resistance within \u223c45 min, capable of detecting single bacteria. This method does not require complex, variable bacterial immobilization and instead uses a laser and detector system to detect single bacterial cells in media as they pass through the laser focus. This provides a simple readout of bacterial antibiotic resistance by detecting growth (resistant) or death (sensitive), much faster than the current methods. The potential of this technique is demonstrated by determining the resistance in both laboratory and clinical strains of Escherichia coli (E. coli), a key species responsible for clinically burdensome urinary tract infections. This work provides the basis for a simple and fast diagnostic tool to detect antibiotic resistance in bacteria, reducing the health and economic burdens of AMR.", "AuthorKeywords": ["antibiotics", "antimicrobial resistance", "bacteria", "cantilevers", "diagnostics", "optical"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antibiotic resistance", "Antimicrobial resistances", "Bacterial antibiotic resistance", "Bacterial growth", "Cantilever sensors", "Escherichia coli (E. coli)", "Nano-mechanical cantilever", "Urinary tract infections"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094220506", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Process Chemistry and Technology", "CENG", "1508"], ["Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes", "CENG", "1507"]], "AuthorData": {"57193135338": {"Name": "Bennett I.", "AuthorID": "57193135338", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London, Cruciform Building"}, "47461610000": {"Name": "Pyne A.L.B.", "AuthorID": "47461610000", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Sir Robert Hadfield Building, University of Sheffield"}, "7006090296": {"Name": "McKendry R.A.", "AuthorID": "7006090296", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London, Cruciform Building"}}}
