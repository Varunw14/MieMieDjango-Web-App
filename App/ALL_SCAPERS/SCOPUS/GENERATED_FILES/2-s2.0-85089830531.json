The patches were intravaginally inserted into rats in the final week of their pregnancy, equivalent to the third trimester of human pregnancy. Maintenance tocolysis with progesterone-loaded patches was elucidated by recording the contractile response of uterine smooth muscle to noradrenaline in pregnant rats. Both progesterone-loaded patches indicated similar results from release and thermal studies, however, patches obtained by electrospinning had smaller average diameters and more uniform dispersion compared to pressurized gyration. Patches obtained by pressurized gyration had better results in production yield and tensile strength than electrospinning; thereby pressurized gyration is better suited for scaled-up production. The patches did not affect cell attachment, viability, and proliferation on Vero cells negatively. Consequently, progesterone-loaded patches are a novel and successful treatment strategy for preventing preterm birth.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electrospinning", "Fibers", "Polymeric patch", "Pressurized gyration", "Preterm birth", "Progesterone"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089830531", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"57196054486": {"Name": "Cam M.E.", "AuthorID": "57196054486", "AffiliationID": "60027981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Marmara University"}, "57211350417": {"Name": "Alenezi H.", "AuthorID": "57211350417", "AffiliationID": "60069831, 60043484", "AffiliationName": "Department of Manufacturing Engineering, College of Technological Studies, PAAET"}, "56725728500": {"Name": "Brako F.", "AuthorID": "56725728500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57200420958": {"Name": "Ahmed J.", "AuthorID": "57200420958", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006247915": {"Name": "Edirisinghe M.", "AuthorID": "7006247915", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "57210993204": {"Name": "Cesur S.", "AuthorID": "57210993204", "AffiliationID": "60027981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Metallurgy and Material Engineering, Faculty of Technology, Marmara University"}, "12797373800": {"Name": "Gunduz O.", "AuthorID": "12797373800", "AffiliationID": "60027981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Metallurgy and Material Engineering, Faculty of Technology, Marmara University"}, "57200390634": {"Name": "Hazar-Yavuz A.N.", "AuthorID": "57200390634", "AffiliationID": "60027981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Marmara University"}, "57216010734": {"Name": "Kabasakal L.", "AuthorID": "57216010734", "AffiliationID": "60027981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Marmara University"}, "57189848353": {"Name": "Ozkan O.", "AuthorID": "57189848353", "AffiliationID": "60021797", "AffiliationName": "Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Atilim University"}, "16680382000": {"Name": "Turkoglu Sasmazel H.", "AuthorID": "16680382000", "AffiliationID": "60021797", "AffiliationName": "Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Atilim University"}, "57218626182": {"Name": "Sayip Eroglu M.", "AuthorID": "57218626182", "AffiliationID": "60079019", "AffiliationName": "TUBITAK-UME, Chemistry Group Laboratories"}, "23020031700": {"Name": "Ren G.", "AuthorID": "23020031700", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering Division, School of Engineering and Technology, University of Hertfordshire"}}}
