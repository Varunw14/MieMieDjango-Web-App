These cases often require referral to a different specialty which increases the overall treatment time and number of appointments. This article introduces a simple, efficient technique using a cylindrical punch biopsy instrument to expose superficial, buccally impacted upper permanent canines and incisor teeth in carefully selected cases. This patient- and operator-friendly technique avoids the need for a referral to a different specialty, gives the orthodontist autonomy of the position of the bond, allows immediate traction, thereby reducing the number of appointments and overall treatment time for the patient.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ectopic canines", "interdisciplinary treatment", "minor oral surgery-orthodontic interface", "soft tissue exposure", "treatment mechanics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cuspid", "Humans", "Incisor", "Maxilla", "Tooth, Impacted"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85080851001", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthodontics", "DENT", "3505"]], "AuthorData": {"57205586317": {"Name": "Amin N.", "AuthorID": "57205586317", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Eastman Dental Hospital, UCLH Foundation Trust"}, "55668001400": {"Name": "Watt E.", "AuthorID": "55668001400", "AffiliationID": "60028145", "AffiliationName": "Kingston Hospital"}, "7004255619": {"Name": "Noar J.", "AuthorID": "7004255619", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Eastman Dental Hospital, UCLH Foundation Trust"}}}
