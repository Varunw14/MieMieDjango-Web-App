However, there are growing concerns about access, particularly among fathers. Using nationally representative data from the 2015 UK Household Longitudinal Survey, this article examines fathers\u2019 perceptions of the availability of hours reduction, schedule flexibility and working from home. Results show that almost one-third of fathers believe that FWAs that reduce working hours are unavailable to them, compared with one-tenth of mothers. There are no gender differences in perceptions of availability of schedule and location flexibility. Among fathers, those with lower education levels, in lower status occupations, working in the private sector and in workplaces that do not have trade union presence are more likely to believe that FWAs are unavailable. Therefore, even though most employees now have the right to request FWAs, a significant minority of fathers do not perceive FWAs to be available to them.", "AuthorKeywords": ["entitlement", "fathers", "flexible working", "working time arrangements", "work\u2013family policies", "work\u2013life balance"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094944618", "SubjectAreas": [["Accounting", "BUSI", "1402"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management", "BUSI", "1407"]], "AuthorData": {"57218278092": {"Name": "Cook R.", "AuthorID": "57218278092", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King\u2019s College London"}, "57190298386": {"Name": "O\u2019Brien M.", "AuthorID": "57190298386", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "57188764179": {"Name": "Connolly S.", "AuthorID": "57188764179", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "University of East Anglia"}, "57143978800": {"Name": "Aldrich M.", "AuthorID": "57143978800", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "University of East Anglia"}, "55815999700": {"Name": "Speight S.", "AuthorID": "55815999700", "AffiliationID": "60120458", "AffiliationName": "NatCen"}}}
