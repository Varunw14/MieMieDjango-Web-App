Neuromodulation: Technology at the Neural Interface published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of International Neuromodulation Society.Objectives: New daily persistent headache (NDPH) is a subset of chronic headache where the pain is continuous from onset. Phenotypically it has chronic migraine or chronic tension type features. NDPH is considered to be highly refractory. Occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) has been used for treatment of refractory chronic migraine but there are no specific reports of its use for NDPH with migrainous features. Materials and Methods: Nine patients with NDPH with migrainous features were identified as having had ONS implants between 2007 and 2014 in a specialist unit with experience of using ONS in chronic migraine. Moderate to severe headache days were compared at baseline and follow-up. A positive response was defined as at least 30% reduction in monthly moderate to severe headache days. Results: Patients had suffered NDPH for a median of 8 years (range 3\u201316 years) and had failed a median of 11 previous treatments (range 8\u201315). After a median follow-up of 53 months (range 27\u2013108 months), only a single patient showed a positive response to ONS. At no point did the cohort as a whole show any change in monthly moderate to severe headache days or disability scores. Conclusion: Our experience suggests that ONS is not effective in the treatment of NDPH with migrainous features even in centers with experience in treating chronic migraine with ONS. The difference in response rates of chronic migraine and NDPH with migrainous features supports the concept of a different pathophysiology to the two conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chronic headache", "chronic migraine", "new daily persistent headache", "occipital nerve stimulation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091732285", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"55391746100": {"Name": "Lagrata S.", "AuthorID": "55391746100", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Headache and Facial Pain Group, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology and The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57209235872": {"Name": "Cheema S.", "AuthorID": "57209235872", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Headache and Facial Pain Group, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology and The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57217204454": {"Name": "Matharu M.", "AuthorID": "57217204454", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Headache and Facial Pain Group, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology and The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7102438957": {"Name": "Watkins L.", "AuthorID": "7102438957", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology and The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
