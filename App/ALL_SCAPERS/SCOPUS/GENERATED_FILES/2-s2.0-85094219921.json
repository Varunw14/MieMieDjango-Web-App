We propose automatic ultrasound segmentation for 3-dimensional spine visualization and scoliosis measurement to address difficulties in using ultrasound for spine imaging. Methods: We trained a convolutional neural network for spine segmentation on ultrasound scans using data from eight healthy adult volunteers. We tested the trained network on eight pediatric patients. We evaluated image segmentation and 3-dimensional volume reconstruction for scoliosis measurement. Results: As expected, fuzzy segmentation metrics reduced when trained networks were translated from healthy volunteers to patients. Recall decreased from 0.72 to 0.64 (8.2% decrease), and precision from 0.31 to 0.27 (3.7% decrease). However, after finding optimal thresholds for prediction maps, binary segmentation metrics performed better on patient data. Recall decreased from 0.98 to 0.97 (1.6% decrease), and precision from 0.10 to 0.06 (4.5% decrease). Segmentation prediction maps were reconstructed to 3-dimensional volumes and scoliosis was measured in all patients. Measurement in these reconstructions took less than 1 minute and had a maximum error of 2.2\u00b0 compared to X-ray. Conclusion: automatic spine segmentation makes scoliosis measurement both efficient and accurate in tracked ultrasound scans. Significance: Automatic segmentation may overcome the limitations of tracked ultrasound that so far prevented its use as an alternative of X-ray in scoliosis measurement.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Artificial neural networks", "Medical diagnostic imaging", "Pediatrics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Automatic segmentations", "Binary segmentation", "Fuzzy segmentation", "Healthy volunteers", "Optimal threshold", "Pediatric patients", "Ultrasound scans", "Volume reconstruction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094219921", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"8956745200": {"Name": "Ungi T.", "AuthorID": "8956745200", "AffiliationID": "60016005", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Percutaneous Surgery at the School of Computing, Queen's University"}, "57195775762": {"Name": "Greer H.", "AuthorID": "57195775762", "AffiliationID": "60114004", "AffiliationName": "Kitware Inc"}, "7004344836": {"Name": "Aylward S.R.", "AuthorID": "7004344836", "AffiliationID": "60114004", "AffiliationName": "Kitware Inc"}, "56895874000": {"Name": "Sunderland K.R.", "AuthorID": "56895874000", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Percutaneous Surgery, School of Computing, Queen's University"}, "57212175556": {"Name": "Wu V.", "AuthorID": "57212175556", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Percutaneous Surgery, School of Computing, Queen's University"}, "6506021565": {"Name": "Baum Z.M.C.", "AuthorID": "6506021565", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Percutaneous Surgery, School of Computing, Queen's University"}, "6602161432": {"Name": "Fichtinger G.", "AuthorID": "6602161432", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Percutaneous Surgery, School of Computing, Queen's University"}, "57194503953": {"Name": "Schlenger C.", "AuthorID": "57194503953", "AffiliationID": "125295461", "AffiliationName": "Verdure Imaging Inc"}, "23028504300": {"Name": "Oetgen M.", "AuthorID": "23028504300", "AffiliationID": "112738973", "AffiliationName": "Children's National Medical Center"}, "26643081000": {"Name": "Cleary K.", "AuthorID": "26643081000", "AffiliationID": "112738973", "AffiliationName": "Children's National Medical Center"}}}
