Nevertheless, current rationality-impairment models do not account for the fact that (a) equivalently irrational beliefs can be induced through adaptive social cognitive processes, reflecting social integration rather than impairment; (b) delusions are overwhelmingly socially themed; and (c) delusions show a reduced sensitivity to social context both in terms of how they are shaped and how they are communicated. Consequently, we argue that models of delusions need to include alteration to coalitional cognition\u2014processes involved in affiliation, group perception, and the strategic management of relationships. This approach has the advantage of better accounting for both content (social themes) and form (fixity) of delusion. It is also supported by the established role of mesolimbic dopamine in both delusions and social organization and the ongoing reconceptualization of belief as serving a social organizational function.", "AuthorKeywords": ["belief", "delusion", "psychosis", "schizophrenia"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096367571", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"7007065687": {"Name": "Bell V.", "AuthorID": "7007065687", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "Psychological Interventions Clinic for Outpatients with Psychosis, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "22954006700": {"Name": "Raihani N.", "AuthorID": "22954006700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "55823860000": {"Name": "Wilkinson S.", "AuthorID": "55823860000", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology, Philosophy and Anthropology, Exeter University"}}}
