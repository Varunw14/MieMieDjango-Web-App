In early nonclinical research, discovery and safety studies are normally undertaken separately. Our aim was to evaluate a novel integrated approach for generating a TTI for drugs intended for prevention of ischaemia-induced ventricular fibrillation (VF). We templated the current best available class 1b antiarrhythmic, mexiletine, using the rat Langendorff preparation. Mexiletine\u2019s beneficial effects on the incidence of VF caused by 120 min regional ischaemia were contrasted with its concurrent adverse effects (on several variables) in the same hearts, to generate a TTI. Mexiletine 0.1 and 0.5 \u00b5M had no adverse effects, but did not reduce VF incidence. Mexiletine 1 \u00b5M reduced VF incidence to 0% but had adverse effects on atrioventricular conduction and ventricular repolarization. Separate studies undertaken using an intraventricular balloon revealed no detrimental effects of mexiletine (1 and 5 \u00b5M) on mechanical function, or any benefit against reperfusion-related dysfunction. Mexiletine\u2019s TTI was found to be less than two, which accords with its clinical therapeutic index. Although non-cardiac adversity, identifiable from additional in vivo studies, may reduce the TTI further, it cannot increase it. Our experimental approach represents a useful early-stage integrated risk/benefit method that, when TTI is found to be low, would eliminate unsuitable class 1b drugs prior to next stage in vivo work, with mexiletine\u2019s TTI defining the gold standard that would need to be bettered.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Anti-Arrhythmia Agents", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Electrocardiography", "Heart", "Male", "Mexiletine", "Myocardial Ischemia", "Organ Culture Techniques", "Rats, Wistar", "Ventricular Fibrillation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085158014", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"6603739900": {"Name": "Hesketh L.M.", "AuthorID": "6603739900", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Division, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, The Rayne Institute, King\u2019s College London, St Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "57021309300": {"Name": "Wilder C.D.E.", "AuthorID": "57021309300", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Division, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, The Rayne Institute, King\u2019s College London, St Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "57220369909": {"Name": "Ranadive N.N.", "AuthorID": "57220369909", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Division, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, The Rayne Institute, King\u2019s College London, St Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "57216888917": {"Name": "Lytra G.", "AuthorID": "57216888917", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Division, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, The Rayne Institute, King\u2019s College London, St Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "57216888871": {"Name": "Qazimi P.", "AuthorID": "57216888871", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Division, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, The Rayne Institute, King\u2019s College London, St Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "57216889793": {"Name": "Munro J.S.", "AuthorID": "57216889793", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Division, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, The Rayne Institute, King\u2019s College London, St Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "57216889747": {"Name": "Ahdi N.", "AuthorID": "57216889747", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Division, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, The Rayne Institute, King\u2019s College London, St Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "18834149300": {"Name": "Curtis M.J.", "AuthorID": "18834149300", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Division, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, The Rayne Institute, King\u2019s College London, St Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}}}
