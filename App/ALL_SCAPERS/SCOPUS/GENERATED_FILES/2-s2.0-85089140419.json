These sub-disciplinary boundaries have further led to an unintended \u2018provincialisation\u2019 of both geographical spaces and theoretical debates, and stalled the development of a theoretically robust anthropology of religion. This special issue argues for the value of comparative work on multi-religious encounters within particular contexts, as well as of thinking comparatively on a global scale, as a way to generate new questions and considerations in how we study religion. The final section offers a short overview of the contributions to the special issue.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anthropology of Christianity", "anthropology of Islam", "anthropology of religion", "comparison", "encounters", "inter-religious coexistence"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089140419", "SubjectAreas": [["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"55776247600": {"Name": "Fesenmyer L.", "AuthorID": "55776247600", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Department of African Studies and Anthropology, University of Birmingham"}, "57189745783": {"Name": "Liberatore G.", "AuthorID": "57189745783", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Sociology & Islamic and Middle Eastern Studies, University of Edinburgh"}, "55625966100": {"Name": "Maqsood A.", "AuthorID": "55625966100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University College London"}}}
