In some contexts, collecting and preserving these documents is part of an effort to claim benefits, such as official victim status or reparations, from the state. In others, it serves as a record of and rebuke to the state\u2019s inaction. In this article, through a comparative case study of victim mobilization in Colombia and Sri Lanka, we explore how these dynamics play out in contexts with high and low (respectively) levels of state action on transitional justice. Drawing on in-depth fieldwork in both contexts, we examine grassroots documentation practices with an eye toward how they reflect the strategic adaptation of international transitional justice norms to specific contexts. We also examine how they organize relationships among individuals, the state, and notions of justice in times of transition from war and dictatorship. We argue that, beyond the strategic engagement with and/or rebuke of the state, these documents are also sites of ritual and memory for those who collect them.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Colombia", "conflict", "Human rights", "norms", "Sri Lanka", "transitional justice"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089539784", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"55907692200": {"Name": "Cronin-Furman K.", "AuthorID": "55907692200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56437755200": {"Name": "Krystalli R.", "AuthorID": "56437755200", "AffiliationID": "60022132", "AffiliationName": "University of St Andrews"}}}
