The current study aims to investigate the volume of brain structures of 88 extremely preterm born 19-year old adolescents and 54 age- and socioeconomically-matched full-term born subjects. In addition, we examine the hypothesis that the volume of grey matter regions where a significant group or group-sex differences are found would be connected with the neurodevelopmental outcome. The results of the analysis show regional brain difference linked to extreme prematurity with reduced grey matter content in the subcortical regions and larger grey matter volumes distributed around the medial prefrontal cortex and anterior medial cortex. Premature birth and the volume of the left precuneus and the right posterior cingulate gyrus accounts for of the variance in FSIQ. The outcome of this analysis reveals that structural brain differences persist into adolescence in extremely preterm subjects and that they correlate with cognitive functions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brain volume", "Grey matter", "Prematurity", "T1-weighted MRI"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain abnormalities", "Brain structure", "Brain volume", "Cognitive functions", "Long-term effects", "Neuropsychological", "Prefrontal cortex", "Sex difference"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092693933", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57204653172": {"Name": "Irzan H.", "AuthorID": "57204653172", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, Kings College London"}, "22980645100": {"Name": "Melbourne A.", "AuthorID": "22980645100", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, Kings College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, Kings College London"}, "57193533556": {"Name": "O\u2019Reilly H.", "AuthorID": "57193533556", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "7006171979": {"Name": "Marlow N.", "AuthorID": "7006171979", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}}}
