Here, we re-analyse Moulton & Cropper's data and show that this conclusion is based on flawed statistical methods' their data in fact confirm a strong positive relationship between founding population size and establishment success. We also refute several non-statistical arguments against the likelihood of such an effect presented by Moulton & Cropper. We conclude that a core tenet of population biology-that small populations are more prone to extinction-applies to alien populations beyond their native geographic range limits as much as to native populations within them.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alien", "Bird", "Establishment", "Propagule pressure", "Small population problem"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083493815", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"7102086774": {"Name": "Blackburn T.M.", "AuthorID": "7102086774", "AffiliationID": "60009498, 60005453", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "6701623283": {"Name": "Cassey P.", "AuthorID": "6701623283", "AffiliationID": "60009512", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Applied Conservation Science, School of Biological Sciences, University of Adelaide"}, "7102841592": {"Name": "Lockwood J.L.", "AuthorID": "7102841592", "AffiliationID": "60119141", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ecology, Evolution and Natural Resources, Rutgers University"}, "7401604644": {"Name": "Duncan R.P.", "AuthorID": "7401604644", "AffiliationID": "60022193", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Applied Ecology, University of Canberra"}}}
