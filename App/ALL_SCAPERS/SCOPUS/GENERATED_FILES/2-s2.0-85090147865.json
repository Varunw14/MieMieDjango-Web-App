AIChE Journal published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of American Institute of Chemical Engineers.This work aims to characterize the mixing and suspension dynamics occurring within two commercially available DASGIP bioreactor configurations, equipped with a two-blade paddle impeller with large impeller to tank diameter ratio, D/T = 0.97. Both continuous and intermittent agitation modes were employed to determine the impact that agitation strategy has upon mass transfer and microcarrier settling/suspension. This paper builds upon the flow dynamics data presented in Part 1 for a flat bottom DASGIP bioreactor and shows how intermittent agitation can break-up regions of slow mixing observed during continuous agitation, therefore substantially increasing the mixing efficiency of the system. Similarly, it was found that microcarrier characteristics might significantly affect the level of suspension when the impeller is in dwell status when intermittent agitation modes are used.", "AuthorKeywords": ["agitation modes", "DASGIP", "microcarriers", "mixing dynamics", "suspension dynamics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bioreactor configurations", "Flow dynamics", "Microcarriers", "Mixing dynamics", "Mixing efficiency", "Suspension dynamics", "Tank diameters", "Two-blade"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090147865", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"57204097712": {"Name": "Samaras J.J.", "AuthorID": "57204097712", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "9743977900": {"Name": "Micheletti M.", "AuthorID": "9743977900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "8259228300": {"Name": "Ducci A.", "AuthorID": "8259228300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
