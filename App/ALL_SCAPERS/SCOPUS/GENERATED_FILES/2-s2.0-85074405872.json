Drawing on a questionnaire study (n = 72), this article reports (a) the impact of music and non-music experiences on specialist music teachers and (b) the associations between experiences, perceived music (teaching) abilities, and their pride as music teachers. Through using a combination of descriptive and inferential statistical techniques, the study found that besides performing abilities positively impacting on music teachers\u2019 perceived teaching abilities and their pride as music teachers, music compositional experiences also significantly impact on music teachers\u2019 perceived teaching abilities. In addition, teachers\u2019 other experiences in the context of their work environment are also significantly associated with their perceived teaching abilities. The implications are that more attention needs to be given to positive music composition experiences and its relationship to music teaching. Moreover, the professional and personal growth of music teachers is constituted by both musical and non-musical development aspects and is impacted by their relationship with their students and their colleagues. Therefore, professional development of music teachers should look beyond their competency development to facilitating and supporting the growth of their music teacher identities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["composition", "development", "experiences", "factor analysis", "identity", "music teacher", "performance"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074405872", "SubjectAreas": [["Music", "ARTS", "1210"], ["Psychology (miscellaneous)", "PSYC", "3201"]], "AuthorData": {"57211557390": {"Name": "Chua S.", "AuthorID": "57211557390", "AffiliationID": "120551857", "AffiliationName": "Singapore Teachers\u2019 Academy for the aRts"}, "7102907357": {"Name": "Welch G.", "AuthorID": "7102907357", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}}}
