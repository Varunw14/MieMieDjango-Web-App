By using oxygen-functionalized engineering, we first obtained oxygen-containing soft carbon nanofibers (ONC) cathodes which delivered a high reversible capacity of 130 mA h g\u22121 over 200 cycles at a current density of 50 mA g\u22121 within a high voltage window. Even at 5.0 A g\u22121, a practical capacity of 68 mA h g\u22121 maintained. The surface-controlled reaction domination instead of diffusion-controlled reaction domination was proposed to harvest high capacitance performance. This storage model effectively overcomes the sluggish properties of storing large-sized K-ions by a diffusion-controlled reaction in conventional cathodes in K-ion batteries (KIBs). The rational design of oxygen functionalization towards approaching more and stable active sites was highlighted. Moreover, a renewable and low-cost full KIHC was configurated by carbonaceous cathode and anode derived from a single carbon source.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carbon nanofibers", "Energy storage", "K-ion hybrid capacitor", "Oxygen-functionalized engineering"], "IndexKeywords": ["Capacitance performance", "Controlled reactions", "Diffusion controlled reactions", "Energy storage systems", "Functionalizations", "Functionalized", "High reversible capacities", "Hybrid capacitor"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081650700", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57192594770": {"Name": "Zhang C.", "AuthorID": "57192594770", "AffiliationID": "60030040", "AffiliationName": "Institute f\u00fcr Physik & IMN MacroNano (ZIK), Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau"}, "57192592509": {"Name": "Xu Y.", "AuthorID": "57192592509", "AffiliationID": "60030040", "AffiliationName": "Institute f\u00fcr Physik & IMN MacroNano (ZIK), Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau"}, "57206751179": {"Name": "Wu Y.", "AuthorID": "57206751179", "AffiliationID": "60030040", "AffiliationName": "Institute f\u00fcr Physik & IMN MacroNano (ZIK), Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau"}, "16641740300": {"Name": "Zhao H.", "AuthorID": "16641740300", "AffiliationID": "60030040", "AffiliationName": "Institute f\u00fcr Physik & IMN MacroNano (ZIK), Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau"}, "56152354500": {"Name": "Lei Y.", "AuthorID": "56152354500", "AffiliationID": "60030040", "AffiliationName": "Institute f\u00fcr Physik & IMN MacroNano (ZIK), Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau"}, "57215692587": {"Name": "Du G.", "AuthorID": "57215692587", "AffiliationID": "60023813", "AffiliationName": "School of Environmental and Chemical Engineering, Shanghai University"}, "57192993157": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "57192993157", "AffiliationID": "60010586", "AffiliationName": "Central Facility for Electron Microscopy, Electron Microscopy Group of Materials Science, Ulm University"}, "7102884063": {"Name": "Kaiser U.", "AuthorID": "7102884063", "AffiliationID": "60010586", "AffiliationName": "Central Facility for Electron Microscopy, Electron Microscopy Group of Materials Science, Ulm University"}}}
