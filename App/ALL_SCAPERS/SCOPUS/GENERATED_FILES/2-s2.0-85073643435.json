GCR are made up of a mixture of multiple charged particles such as protons, 4He, and 56Fe heavy ions. The most harmful to the CNS are the more highly charged and energetic (HZE) particles, including 56Fe because of their significant biological effect contribution to GCR dose and high linear energy transfer. These HZE particles can result in altered cognitive function, reduced motor function and behavioural changes and long term chronic brain disease. There is currently a lack of data on the biological response to 56Fe ions. In this regard, ground based experiments could be used to infer the effects of the cosmic environment on cell survival. A mono-energetic beam of 56Fe ions was generated by the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator Chiba, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Chiba, Japan. Three different types of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cell lines were studied. Using GBM cell lines which arise from the glia cells could aid in the understanding of the effects of space radiation to the brain. Clonogenic assay was used to determine the efficacy of the radiations. Certain strains of GBM are low-dose hypersensitive and hence, the very low doses used to study space radiation here are relevant. Results show that 0.2 Gy 56Fe (500 MeV/- 200 keV/\u03bcm) ions were able to inactivate approximately 8% of T98G, 15% LN18 and 27% of U87 cells. These results may infer and demonstrate the deleterious effects of 56Fe ions on human CNS, since a significant percentage of GBM cells were killed at very low doses. The data presented may therefore be employed in assessing risk related to high LET radiation exposure, simulating the effects in space radiation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["56Fe", "Galactic cosmic rays", "GBM", "Radiobiological effects", "Space radiation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Galactic cosmic rays", "Glioblastoma multiforme", "High linear energy transfers", "National Institute of Radiological Sciences", "Radiobiological effects", "Space radiation exposure", "Space radiations", "^56Fe"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073643435", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"]], "AuthorData": {"57206192831": {"Name": "Chew M.T.", "AuthorID": "57206192831", "AffiliationID": "60107208", "AffiliationName": "Sunway University, School of Healthcare and Health Sciences, Centre for Biomedical Physics, Jalan Universiti"}, "7403122642": {"Name": "Bradley D.A.", "AuthorID": "7403122642", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences, University of Surrey"}, "7005065727": {"Name": "Nisbet A.", "AuthorID": "7005065727", "AffiliationID": "60028760", "AffiliationName": "The Department of Medical Physics, Royal Surrey County Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7404958175": {"Name": "Jones B.", "AuthorID": "7404958175", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Gray Laboratory, CRUK/MRC Oxford Centre, Old Road Campus Research Building, University of Oxford"}, "57221030897": {"Name": "Suzuki M.", "AuthorID": "57221030897", "AffiliationID": "60019823, 60138469", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic Medical Sciences for Radiation Damages, National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS), National Institutes for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology"}, "6701782111": {"Name": "Matsufuji N.", "AuthorID": "6701782111", "AffiliationID": "60019823, 60138469", "AffiliationName": "Radiation Effect Research Team, Department of Accelerator and Medical Physics, NIRS, National Institutes for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology"}, "55619319619": {"Name": "Murakami T.", "AuthorID": "55619319619", "AffiliationID": "60019823, 60138469", "AffiliationName": "Heavy-Ion Radiotherapy Promotion Unit & Department of Accelerator and Medical Physics, NIRS, National Institutes for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology"}}}
