The images are enhanced based on a steerable and multi-scale resolution enhancement algorithm. It is initiated by capturing the spatial variations in decomposition orientations, and decomposition scales of the EIT image. The interpretation of projected image sub-bands is translated into resolution through statistical processes. A steerable filter containing Gaussian basis function derivatives captures the statistical information. Using the regional quantization method (RQM) proposed in this paper, projection weights are computed through spatial statistics of the image sub-bands and tuned adaptively. RQM assigns more resolution to those directional edges which have higher standard deviation and embeds high-order curvatures into the EIT images while suppressing noise. Comparison with conventional image enhancement methods demonstrates the superior performance of RQM. Using RQM it is shown that for 16, 32 and 64 electrode configurations with noise-free recording of $32\\times 32$ EIT images the number of electrodes can be reduced by 5, 7 and 12 respectively without loss of detail.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adaptive resolution enhancement", "contrast improving index", "distortion embedding", "electrical impedance tomography", "electrodes optimization", "local statistics", "signal-to-noise ratio", "steerable filter"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electrical impe dance tomography (EIT)", "Electrical impedance tomography", "Electrode configurations", "Gaussian basis functions", "Resolution enhancement", "Standard deviation", "Statistical information", "Statistical process"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086308870", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"57198744432": {"Name": "Zamani M.", "AuthorID": "57198744432", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "6603720155": {"Name": "Demosthenous A.", "AuthorID": "6603720155", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "6603764288": {"Name": "Bayford R.", "AuthorID": "6603764288", "AffiliationID": "60014105", "AffiliationName": "Department of Natural Sciences, Middlesex University"}}}
