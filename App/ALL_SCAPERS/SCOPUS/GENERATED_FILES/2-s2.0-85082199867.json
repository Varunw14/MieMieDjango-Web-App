Methods: Serum and plasma were obtained from PD patients without known mutations (GU-PD, n = 124)), carriers of the A53T/G209A point mutation in the \u03b1-synuclein gene (SNCA) (n = 29), and respective age-/sex-matched controls. Levels of total \u03b1-synuclein were assessed using an in-house ELISA assay. Results: A statistically significant increase of \u03b1-synuclein levels was found in serum, but not plasma, from GU-PD patients compared to healthy controls. A statistically significant decrease of \u03b1-synuclein levels was found in serum and plasma from symptomatic A53T mutation carriers compared to healthy controls. Plasma \u03b1-synuclein levels were modestly negatively correlated with UPDRS part III score and disease duration in A53T-PD patients. Conclusion: Increased \u03b1-synuclein levels in serum of GU-PD patients suggest a systemic deregulation of \u03b1-synuclein homeostasis in PD. The opposite results in A53T-PD highlight the complexity of \u03b1-synuclein homeostatic regulation in PD, and suggest the possibility of reduced expression of the mutant allele.", "AuthorKeywords": ["A53T", "Alpha-synuclein", "Parkinson disease", "Plasma", "Serum"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082199867", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"24554161200": {"Name": "Emmanouilidou E.", "AuthorID": "24554161200", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Biochemistry, Department of Chemistry, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "8725085500": {"Name": "Vekrellis K.", "AuthorID": "8725085500", "AffiliationID": "60003185", "AffiliationName": "Center of Basic Research, Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens"}, "57188849793": {"Name": "Papagiannakis N.", "AuthorID": "57188849793", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Second Department of Neurology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Medical School"}, "12790281200": {"Name": "Maniati M.", "AuthorID": "12790281200", "AffiliationID": "60003185", "AffiliationName": "Center of Clinical Research, Experimental Surgery and Translational Research, Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens"}, "57202963715": {"Name": "Stefanis L.", "AuthorID": "57202963715", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Second Department of Neurology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Medical School"}, "15834998200": {"Name": "Koros C.", "AuthorID": "15834998200", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "First Department of Neurology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Medical School"}, "55948360500": {"Name": "Antonellou R.", "AuthorID": "55948360500", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Second Department of Neurology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Medical School"}, "6507557970": {"Name": "Bozi M.", "AuthorID": "6507557970", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Second Department of Neurology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Medical School"}, "57194195667": {"Name": "Kouloulia S.", "AuthorID": "57194195667", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "57208927204": {"Name": "Galaziou A.", "AuthorID": "57208927204", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "7101638282": {"Name": "Ioannou P.C.", "AuthorID": "7101638282", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "56430631100": {"Name": "Papadimitriou D.", "AuthorID": "56430631100", "AffiliationID": "60022782", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Henry Dunant Hospital Center"}, "6602506819": {"Name": "Athanasiadou A.", "AuthorID": "6602506819", "AffiliationID": "60024484", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Patras Medical School"}}}
