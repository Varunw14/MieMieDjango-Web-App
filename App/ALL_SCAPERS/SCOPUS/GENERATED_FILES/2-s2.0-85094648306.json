Obesity published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of The Obesity Society (TOS).Objective: Intergenerational data on mother\u2013offspring pairs were utilized in an instrumental variable analysis to examine the longitudinal association between BMI and sedentary behavior. Methods: The sample included 3,864 mother\u2013offspring pairs from the 1970 British Cohort Study. Height and weight were recorded in mothers (age 31 [5.4] years) and offspring (age 10 years) and repeated in offspring during adulthood. Offspring provided objective data on sedentary behavior (7-day thigh-worn activPAL) in adulthood at age 46 to 47 years. Results: Maternal BMI, the instrumental variable, was associated with offspring BMI at age 10 (change per kg/m2, \u03b2 = 0.11; 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.12), satisfying a key assumption of instrumental variable analyses. Offspring (change per kg/m2, \u03b2 = 0.010; 95% CI: \u22120.02 to 0.03 h/d) and maternal BMI (\u03b2 = 0.017; 95% CI: 0.001 to 0.03 h/d) was related to offspring sedentary time, suggestive of a causal impact of BMI on sedentary behavior (two-stage least squares analysis, \u03b2 = 0.18 [SE 0.08], P = 0.015). For moderate-vigorous physical activity, there were associations with offspring BMI (\u03b2 = \u22120.010; 95% CI: \u22120.017 to \u22120.004) and maternal BMI (\u03b2 = \u22120.007; 95% CI: \u22120.010 to \u22120.003), with evidence for causality (two-stage least squares analysis, \u03b2 = \u22120.060 [SE 0.02], P = 0.001). Conclusions: There is strong evidence for a causal pathway linking childhood obesity to greater sedentary behavior.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094648306", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"8502496600": {"Name": "Hamer M.", "AuthorID": "8502496600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Sport Exercise & Health, Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London"}, "6506423360": {"Name": "Chastin S.", "AuthorID": "6506423360", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Movement and Sports Science, Ghent University"}, "7005899067": {"Name": "Viner R.M.", "AuthorID": "7005899067", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "55847987800": {"Name": "Stamatakis E.", "AuthorID": "55847987800", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Charles Perkins Centre, School of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of Sydney"}}}
