The Warnock Report has been highly influential with respect to the development of both national and local policy and practice for SEN, primarily in England but also in the UK generally and internationally. We conceived the \u201cWarnock 40 Years On\u201d research topic published in this journal as an opportunity to examine developments for children and young people with SEN or a disability (SEND) since the Report's publication. As editors of this research topic, in this paper we provide an overview of major elements within SEND, drawing on both the individual constituent papers and the broader policy and research literature. We examine the origins and precursors of the Warnock Review, including then current progressive conceptual development and practice, leading to an examination of the Review. We explore the legislative structure arising from the Report and implementation of the SEND system\u2014from the Education Act 1981 onwards. We critically examine a number of key aspects of the Warnock Report and how these developments of the SEND system have taken these forward, including: categorization of SEN; provision made to meet the special needs of children and young people with SEN or a disability, including inclusion; early identification and intervention; the important rights and role of parents; prevalence of different types of SEN and the complex interaction between SEN and a range of factors, including social disadvantage and ethnicity; and a range of SEND research. Finally we consider the implications for future development of the SEND system, in particular whether its limitations can be addressed better by \u201cpatching up\u201d the system or by \u201csystem change.\u201d Although focused on England, this paper has relevance\u2014as did the Warnock Report\u2014to SEND internationally.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autism Spectrum Disorder", "developmental language disorder", "disproportionality", "inclusive education", "SEN disagreement resolution", "special educational needs (SEN)", "special educational needs coordinators (SENCOs)"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089419465", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"7102841300": {"Name": "Lindsay G.", "AuthorID": "7102841300", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Educational Development, Appraisal and Research, University of Warwick"}, "25650983500": {"Name": "Wedell K.", "AuthorID": "25650983500", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, UCL"}, "7004429681": {"Name": "Dockrell J.", "AuthorID": "7004429681", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, UCL"}}}
