Published by BMJ.Objectives: To investigate how the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic influenced decisions of rheumatologists and health professionals in rheumatology regarding the management of patients with inflammatory rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs). Methods: An English-language questionnaire was developed by a EULAR working group and distributed via national rheumatology societies of EULAR countries, EMEUNET and individual working group members. Responses were collected using an online survey tool. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Results: We analysed 1286 responses from 35/45 EULAR countries. Due to containment measures, 82% of respondents indicated cancellation/postponement of face-to-face visits of new patients (84% of them offering remote consultation) and 91% of follow-up visits (96% with remote consultation). The majority of respondents (58%) perceived that the interval between symptom onset and first rheumatological consultations was longer during containment restrictions than before. Treatment decisions were frequently postponed (34%), and the majority (74%) of respondents stated that it was less likely to start a biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD)/targeted synthetic DMARD during the pandemic, mainly because of patients' fear, limited availability of screening procedures and decreased availability of rheumatological services. Use of (hydroxy)chloroquine (HCQ) and tocilizumab (TCZ) for the COVID-19 indication was reported by 47% and 42% of respondents, respectively, leading to a shortage of these drugs for RMDs indications according to 49% and 14% of respondents, respectively. Conclusion: Measures related to containment of COVID-19 pandemic led to a perceived delay between symptom onset and a first rheumatological visit, postponement of treatment decisions, and shortage of HCQ and TCZ, thereby negatively impacting early treatment and treat-to-target strategies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["arthritis", "autoimmune diseases", "epidemiology", "health services research", "rheumatoid"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096084176", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"11641035700": {"Name": "Dejaco C.", "AuthorID": "11641035700", "AffiliationID": "124925155", "AffiliationName": "Rheumatology, Hospital of Brunico (SABES-ASDAA)"}, "17342226500": {"Name": "Alunno A.", "AuthorID": "17342226500", "AffiliationID": "60003003", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Rheumatology Unit, University of Perugia"}, "24473033300": {"Name": "Bijlsma J.W.J.", "AuthorID": "24473033300", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Umc Utrecht"}, "7004257892": {"Name": "Boonen A.", "AuthorID": "7004257892", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, School for Public Health and Primary Care (CAPHRI), Maastricht University Medical Centre"}, "7005496707": {"Name": "Combe B.", "AuthorID": "7005496707", "AffiliationID": "60108488, 60031773", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, Chu Montpellier, Montpellier University"}, "6602653160": {"Name": "Finckh A.", "AuthorID": "6602653160", "AffiliationID": "60009963", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, University Hospital of Geneva"}, "57204348200": {"Name": "MacHado P.M.", "AuthorID": "57204348200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544, 60031535", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, University College London, University College London Hospitals, Northwick Park Hospital"}, "35362331200": {"Name": "Padjen I.", "AuthorID": "35362331200", "AffiliationID": "60006461, 60008408", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Centre Zagreb, University of Zagreb, School of Medicine"}, "15840570900": {"Name": "Sivera F.", "AuthorID": "15840570900", "AffiliationID": "60005534", "AffiliationName": "Rheumatology, Hospital General de Elda"}, "7004321698": {"Name": "Stamm T.A.", "AuthorID": "7004321698", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics and Intelligent Systems, Section for Outcomes Research, Medical University of Vienna"}, "56244567800": {"Name": "Buttgereit F.", "AuthorID": "56244567800", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Rheumatology and Immunology, Charite Medical Faculty Berlin"}}}
