Test whether prior attitudes moderate the impact of contact on changes in attitudes towards the police. Methods: A two-wave panel survey of a nationally representative sample of Australian adults measured people\u2019s beliefs about police trustworthiness (procedural fairness and effectiveness), their duty to obey the police, their contact with the police between the two waves, and their evaluation of those encounters in terms of process and outcome. Analysis is carried out using autoregressive structural equation modeling and latent moderated structural models. Results: The association between both process and outcome evaluation of police-citizen encounters and changes in attitudes towards the police is asymmetrical for trust in police effectiveness, symmetrical for trust in procedural fairness, and asymmetrical (in the opposite direction expected) for duty to obey the police. Little evidence of heterogeneity in the association between encounters and trust in procedural fairness and duty to obey, but prior levels of perceived effectiveness moderate the association between outcome evaluation and changes in trust in police effectiveness. Conclusions: The association between police-citizen encounters and attitudes towards the police may not be as asymmetrical as previously thought, particularly for changes in trust in procedural fairness and legitimacy. Policy implications include considering public-police interactions as \u2018teachable moments\u2019 and potential sources for enhancing police trustworthiness and legitimacy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Legitimacy", "Panel analysis", "Police-citizen encounters", "Policing", "Procedural justice"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091524410", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"57208108488": {"Name": "Oliveira T.R.", "AuthorID": "57208108488", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "Department of Methodology, London School of Economics and Political Science"}, "7404117113": {"Name": "Jackson J.", "AuthorID": "7404117113", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "Department of Methodology, London School of Economics and Political Science"}, "7402861587": {"Name": "Murphy K.", "AuthorID": "7402861587", "AffiliationID": "60032987", "AffiliationName": "Griffith Criminology Institute, Griffith University"}, "30367516400": {"Name": "Bradford B.", "AuthorID": "30367516400", "AffiliationID": "60090044, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Jill Dando Institute of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}}}
