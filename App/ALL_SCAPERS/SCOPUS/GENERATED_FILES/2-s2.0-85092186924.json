Since it is a very multidisciplinary use case, involving a variety of stakeholders tackling complex issues and topics, some of them joined their efforts and skills in the European Network for Digital Building Permit. The initial activity of the network, after a review of on-going experiences, was a workshop to share knowledge about the topics involved and to identify the main ambitions of the network with respect to three pillars (i.e. Process - Rules and Requirements - Technology) and the related requirements. It was achieved through a collective brainstorming activity guided by digital tools, whose results were further analysed in a post-processing phase. Such results are presented in this paper and will be the base for planning the future network activity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["3d information systems", "Building permits", "Digital tools", "European networks", "Future networks", "Initial activity", "Post processing", "Share knowledge"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092186924", "SubjectAreas": [["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"]], "AuthorData": {"56768224100": {"Name": "Noardo F.", "AuthorID": "56768224100", "AffiliationID": "60006288", "AffiliationName": "3D Geoinformation group, Delft University of Technology"}, "6507159121": {"Name": "Stoter J.", "AuthorID": "6507159121", "AffiliationID": "60006288", "AffiliationName": "3D Geoinformation group, Delft University of Technology"}, "57192423634": {"Name": "Malacarne G.", "AuthorID": "57192423634", "AffiliationID": "118547428", "AffiliationName": "Fraunhofer Italia Research"}, "57209801455": {"Name": "Mastrolembo Ventura S.", "AuthorID": "57209801455", "AffiliationID": "60015300", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Civil, Environmental, Architectural Engineering and Mathematics, University of Brescia"}, "18042749100": {"Name": "Tagliabue L.C.", "AuthorID": "18042749100", "AffiliationID": "60015300", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Civil, Environmental, Architectural Engineering and Mathematics, University of Brescia"}, "56028032400": {"Name": "Ciribini A.L.C.", "AuthorID": "56028032400", "AffiliationID": "60015300", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Civil, Environmental, Architectural Engineering and Mathematics, University of Brescia"}, "12767125600": {"Name": "Ellul C.", "AuthorID": "12767125600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "57196153858": {"Name": "Guler D.", "AuthorID": "57196153858", "AffiliationID": "60022002", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geomatics Engineering, Istanbul Technical University"}, "56396851400": {"Name": "Harrie L.", "AuthorID": "56396851400", "AffiliationID": "101180416", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physical Geography and Ecosystem Science, Lund University Lund"}, "57218436932": {"Name": "Senger L.", "AuthorID": "57218436932", "AffiliationID": "60004935", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Construction Management and Digital Engineering, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover"}, "57219306570": {"Name": "Waha A.", "AuthorID": "57219306570", "AffiliationID": "125193500", "AffiliationName": "Cogital Ltd"}}}
