Methods: Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT), confocal and split detector AOSLO were acquired from seven patients (10 eyes) with small (early) EZ lesions on SDOCT secondary to macular telangiectasia type 2 at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. The presence of cone structure on AOSLO in areas of EZ loss as well as cones at 1\u00b0 eccentricity, and their change over time were quantified. Results: By split detector AOSLO, remnant cone structure was identified within and on the borders of all foveal EZ lesions. Within the extent of these lesions, cone spacing ranged from 4.97 to 9.95 \u03bcm at baseline, 5.30 to 6.10 \u03bcm at 6 months, and 4.99 to 7.12 \u03bcm at 12 months. Four eyes with significantly smaller EZ lesions showed evidence of recovery of EZ reflectivity on SDOCT B-scans. Remnant cone structure was identified in some areas where EZ reflectivity recovered at the following time point. Eyes that showed recovery of EZ reflectivity had a continuous external limiting membrane. Conclusions: Remnant cone structure can persist within small SDOCT-defined EZ lesions, which can wax and wane in appearance over time. AOSLO can help to inform the interpretation of SDOCT imaging. Translational Relevance: The absence of EZ in early macular telangiectasia type 2 and other retinal conditions needs careful interpretation because it does not always indicate an absence of underlying cone structure. The integrity of the external limiting membrane may better predict the presence of remnant cone structure and recovery of EZ reflectivity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy", "Cones", "Ellipsoid zone", "Macular telangiectasia"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85098598063", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"56503899900": {"Name": "Litts K.M.", "AuthorID": "56503899900", "AffiliationID": "60012553", "AffiliationName": "Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences, Medical College of Wisconsin"}, "57209748679": {"Name": "Mastey R.R.", "AuthorID": "57209748679", "AffiliationID": "60012553", "AffiliationName": "Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences, Medical College of Wisconsin"}, "7402034918": {"Name": "Carroll J.", "AuthorID": "7402034918", "AffiliationID": "60012553", "AffiliationName": "Cell Biology, Neurobiology and Anatomy, Medical College of Wisconsin"}, "57194619974": {"Name": "Okada M.", "AuthorID": "57194619974", "AffiliationID": "60019331", "AffiliationName": "Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital"}, "55555386500": {"Name": "Heeren T.F.C.", "AuthorID": "55555386500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "36490013200": {"Name": "Kalitzeos A.", "AuthorID": "36490013200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57194618245": {"Name": "Rocco V.", "AuthorID": "57194618245", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57205562835": {"Name": "Singh N.", "AuthorID": "57205562835", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57205561522": {"Name": "Kane T.", "AuthorID": "57205561522", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57190221940": {"Name": "Kasilian M.", "AuthorID": "57190221940", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57202482672": {"Name": "Michaelides M.", "AuthorID": "57202482672", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "8101026700": {"Name": "Egan C.", "AuthorID": "8101026700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57202026571": {"Name": "Fruttiger M.", "AuthorID": "57202026571", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
