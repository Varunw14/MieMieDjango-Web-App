Fiscal Studies published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd. on behalf of Institute for Fiscal StudiesWe examine the relationship between parental ethnic identity and the test scores of ethnic minority children. We use standard survey measures of the strength of parental identity alongside validated cognitive test scores in a rich British cohort study. We show that children whose mothers report either an adoption or an active rejection of the majority identity tend to score lower in cognitive tests at age 7, compared with those children whose mothers report neutral feelings about the majority identity. We find no consistent differences in test scores according to mothers\u2019 minority identity. Our findings provide no support for education or citizenship policies that promote the adoption of the majority identity or discourage the maintenance of separate identities in ethnic minority communities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["child development", "Ethnic identity", "national identity", "test scores"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089562941", "SubjectAreas": [["Accounting", "BUSI", "1402"], ["Finance", "ECON", "2003"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"57204603951": {"Name": "Campbell S.", "AuthorID": "57204603951", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55318706700": {"Name": "Nuevo-Chiquero A.", "AuthorID": "55318706700", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "University of Edinburgh and IZA"}, "23135843800": {"Name": "Popli G.", "AuthorID": "23135843800", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "University of Sheffield"}, "36470902400": {"Name": "Ratcliffe A.", "AuthorID": "36470902400", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "University of Sheffield"}}}
