In breast cancer, there are frequently long time intervals between cells leaving the primary tumour and growth of overt metastases2,3. Reasons for disease indolence and subsequent transition back to aggressive growth include interactions with myeloid and fibroblastic cells in the tumour microenvironment and ongoing immune surveillance4\u20136. However, the signals that cause actively growing cells to enter an indolent state, thereby enabling them to survive for extended periods of time, are not well understood. Here we reveal how the behaviour of indolent breast cancer cells in the lung is determined by their interactions with alveolar epithelial cells, in particular alveolar type 1 cells. This promotes the formation of fibronectin fibrils by indolent cells that drive integrin-dependent pro-survival signals. Combined in vivo RNA sequencing and drop-out screening identified secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (SFRP2) as a key mediator of this interaction. Sfrp2 is induced in breast cancer cells by signals from lung epithelial cells and promotes fibronectin fibril formation and survival, whereas blockade of Sfrp2 expression reduces the burden of indolent disease.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alveolar Epithelial Cells", "Animals", "Breast Neoplasms", "Cell Line", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Female", "Humans", "Membrane Proteins", "Mice", "Mice, Nude", "Neoplasm Metastasis", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src)", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079749868", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"15846356400": {"Name": "Montagner M.", "AuthorID": "15846356400", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padua"}, "25627113200": {"Name": "Bhome R.", "AuthorID": "25627113200", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Tumour Cell Biology Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute"}, "23027206500": {"Name": "Hooper S.", "AuthorID": "23027206500", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Tumour Cell Biology Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute"}, "57210744709": {"Name": "Bhargava A.", "AuthorID": "57210744709", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Tumour Cell Biology Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute"}, "55076136700": {"Name": "Ratcliffe C.D.H.", "AuthorID": "55076136700", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Tumour Cell Biology Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute"}, "57215072056": {"Name": "Naito Y.", "AuthorID": "57215072056", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Tumour Cell Biology Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute"}, "35551546000": {"Name": "Sahai E.", "AuthorID": "35551546000", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Tumour Cell Biology Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute"}, "56641849500": {"Name": "Pocaterra A.", "AuthorID": "56641849500", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padua"}, "55403192700": {"Name": "Chakravarty P.", "AuthorID": "55403192700", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Bioinformatics Platform, The Francis Crick Institute"}, "57215043533": {"Name": "Qin X.", "AuthorID": "57215043533", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cell Communication Lab, Department of Oncology, University College London Cancer Institute"}, "57215062839": {"Name": "Sufi J.", "AuthorID": "57215062839", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cell Communication Lab, Department of Oncology, University College London Cancer Institute"}, "36444399100": {"Name": "Tape C.J.", "AuthorID": "36444399100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cell Communication Lab, Department of Oncology, University College London Cancer Institute"}}}
