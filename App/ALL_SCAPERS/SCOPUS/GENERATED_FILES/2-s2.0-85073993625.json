I argue that the opportunities for reciprocal learning provided by that body of literature is rather limited and problematic because of its uncritical acceptance of the OECD\u2019s basic premises about PISA and because of its employment of the \u2018best practices\u2019 approach to policy borrowing. Using Singapore as a case, I contend that reciprocal learning needs to be informed by the cultural historical narratives behind the development of an education system and a theory of pedagogy that locates the practice of teaching within a broad social, institutional, and instructional context of schooling. I discuss lessons from and for Singapore concerning the purposes of schooling, institutional norms and arrangements, and pedagogical practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["High-performing education systems", "Pedagogy", "PISA", "Reciprocal learning", "Singapore"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073993625", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"]], "AuthorData": {"7402665793": {"Name": "Deng Z.", "AuthorID": "7402665793", "AffiliationID": "60010940, 60005510", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University"}}}
