Pain researchers, however, generally assert that chronic pain has no adaptive significance, representing instead a pathophysiological state. This belief was recently challenged by the observation [2] that nociceptive sensitization caused by a chronic pain-producing injury reduced predation risk in squid (Doryteuthis pealeii). In that study, injury to an arm (removal of the tip with a scalpel) 6 hours prior led to increased targeting by black sea bass, resulting in decreased survival of the squid in a 30-minute trial featuring free interaction between predator and prey. The surprising finding was that anesthesia during surgery, preventing the chronic nociceptor sensitization associated with such injuries, led to even lower probability of survival. That is, the likely presence of pain increased apparent fitness, and the authors concluded that the chronic pain state and its associated nociceptive sensitization represented an adaptive function. Pain-induced defensive behaviors affecting fitness have also been reported in crustaceans (Gammarus fossarum) [3]. It is, however, currently unknown whether this may also be true in any other species, including in Mammalia. Studies in invertebrates suggest that the adaptive value of chronic pain may lie in producing hypervigilance to predation. Lister et al. test the hypothesis that chronic pain may produce hypervigilance in mice. Using an octagonal maze, they show that mouse avoidance of fox urine is increased after experimental nerve injury producing chronic pain.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089029398", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"57218386353": {"Name": "Lister K.C.", "AuthorID": "57218386353", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Anesthesia, McGill University"}, "57218386311": {"Name": "Bouchard S.M.", "AuthorID": "57218386311", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Anesthesia, McGill University"}, "57218384916": {"Name": "Markova T.", "AuthorID": "57218384916", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Anesthesia, McGill University"}, "57203313471": {"Name": "Aternali A.", "AuthorID": "57203313471", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Anesthesia, McGill University"}, "57218385793": {"Name": "Denecli P.", "AuthorID": "57218385793", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Anesthesia, McGill University"}, "57210839940": {"Name": "Pimentel S.D.", "AuthorID": "57210839940", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Anesthesia, McGill University"}, "57218386154": {"Name": "Majeed M.", "AuthorID": "57218386154", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Anesthesia, McGill University"}, "8730871100": {"Name": "Austin J.S.", "AuthorID": "8730871100", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Anesthesia, McGill University"}, "7006362839": {"Name": "Mogil J.S.", "AuthorID": "7006362839", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Anesthesia, McGill University"}, "8782483500": {"Name": "Amanda A.C.", "AuthorID": "8782483500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Health and Educational Psychology, University College London"}}}
