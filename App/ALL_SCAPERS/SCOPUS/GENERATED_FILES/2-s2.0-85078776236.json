Three claims in particular have underpinned this popular perspective: that the confidence people have in their memory is weakly related to its accuracy, that false memories of fictitious childhood events can be easily implanted, and that the public wrongly sees memory as being like a video camera. New research has clarified that all three claims rest on shaky foundations, suggesting there is no reason to abandon the old consensus about memory being malleable but essentially reliable.", "AuthorKeywords": ["confidence", "false memory", "lay beliefs", "memory accuracy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078776236", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"7006656085": {"Name": "Brewin C.R.", "AuthorID": "7006656085", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "7202643441": {"Name": "Andrews B.", "AuthorID": "7202643441", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway, University of London"}, "57211248491": {"Name": "Mickes L.", "AuthorID": "57211248491", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychological Science, University of Bristol"}}}
