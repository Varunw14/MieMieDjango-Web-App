KGaA, WeinheimMolecular surfactants are widely used to control low-dimensional morphologies, including 2D nanomaterials in colloidal chemical synthesis, but it is still highly challenging to accurately control single-layer growth for 2D materials. A scalable stacking-hinderable strategy to not only enable exclusive single-layer growth mode for transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) selectively sandwiched by surfactant molecules but also retain sandwiched single-layer TMDs' photoredox activities is developed. The single-layer growth mechanism is well explained by theoretical calculation. Three types of single-layer TMDs, including MoS2, WS2, and ReS2, are successfully synthesized and demonstrated in solar H2 fuel production from hydrogen-stored liquid carrier\u2014methanol. Such H2 fuel production from single-layer MoS2 nanosheets is COx-free and reliably workable under room temperature and normal pressure with the generation rate reaching \u2248617 \u00b5mole g\u22121 h\u22121 and excellent photoredox endurability. This strategy opens up the feasible avenue to develop methanol-storable solar H2 fuel with facile chemical rebonding actualized by 2D single-layer photocatalysts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["2D materials", "methanol-storable fuel, H2 fuel", "single-layer transition metal dichalcogenides", "solar-driven photocatalysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Colloidal chemical synthesis", "Fuel production", "Generation rate", "Low dimensional", "Normal pressure", "Surfactant molecules", "Theoretical calculations", "Transition metal dichalcogenides"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074372591", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"57203299623": {"Name": "Pang Y.", "AuthorID": "57203299623", "AffiliationID": "60031226", "AffiliationName": "Curtin Institute of Functional Molecules and Interfaces, School of Molecular and Life Sciences, Curtin University"}, "57204668049": {"Name": "Chen W.", "AuthorID": "57204668049", "AffiliationID": "60031226", "AffiliationName": "Curtin Institute of Functional Molecules and Interfaces, School of Molecular and Life Sciences, Curtin University"}, "57208437980": {"Name": "Javaid S.", "AuthorID": "57208437980", "AffiliationID": "60031226", "AffiliationName": "Curtin Institute of Functional Molecules and Interfaces, School of Molecular and Life Sciences, Curtin University"}, "57203301977": {"Name": "Barker E.", "AuthorID": "57203301977", "AffiliationID": "60031226", "AffiliationName": "Curtin Institute of Functional Molecules and Interfaces, School of Molecular and Life Sciences, Curtin University"}, "7103360294": {"Name": "Jia G.", "AuthorID": "7103360294", "AffiliationID": "60031226", "AffiliationName": "Curtin Institute of Functional Molecules and Interfaces, School of Molecular and Life Sciences, Curtin University"}, "55757780322": {"Name": "Uddin M.N.", "AuthorID": "55757780322", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "Research School of Chemistry, Australian National University"}, "8868122600": {"Name": "Yin Z.", "AuthorID": "8868122600", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "Research School of Chemistry, Australian National University"}, "55588581000": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "55588581000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, University College London"}, "7006653946": {"Name": "Suvorova A.", "AuthorID": "7006653946", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Microscopy, Characterization and Analysis (CMCA), The University of Western Australia"}, "7201859519": {"Name": "Saunders M.", "AuthorID": "7201859519", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Microscopy, Characterization and Analysis (CMCA), The University of Western Australia"}}}
