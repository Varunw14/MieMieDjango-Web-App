Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Here we present relative abundances of planktic foraminifera that span the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO) at Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1258 in the western equatorial Atlantic. The EECO (~53.3\u221249.1 Ma) represents peak Cenozoic warmth, probably related to high atmospheric CO2, and when planktic foraminifera, a dominant component of marine sediment, exhibit a major biotic response. Consistent with previous work, the relative abundance of the genus Morozovella, which dominated early Paleogene tropical-subtropical assemblages, markedly and permanently declined from a mean percentage of ~32% to less than ~7% at the beginning of the EECO. The distinct decrease in Morozovella abundance occurred at Site 1258 within ~20 kyr before a negative excursion in \u03b413C records known as the J event and which defines the beginning of EECO. Moreover, all morozovellid species except M. aragonensis dropped in abundance permanently at Site 1258, and this is related to a reduction in test-size. Comparing our data with that from other locations, the remarkable switch in planktonic foraminifera assemblages appears to have begun first with unfavourable environmental conditions near the Equator and then extended to higher latitudes. Several potential stressors may explain observations, including some combination of algal photosymbiont inhibition (bleaching), a sustained increase in temperature, or an extended decrease in pH.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atlantic Ocean", "Bulk carbon isotopes", "Early Eocene Climatic Optimum", "Morozovella decline", "Morozovella test-size reduction", "Paleobiogeography", "Planktic foraminiferal changes"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85080992456", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"57189324878": {"Name": "D\u2019onofrio R.", "AuthorID": "57189324878", "AffiliationID": "60024690", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Earth Sciences, Ferrara University"}, "56096947200": {"Name": "Luciani V.", "AuthorID": "56096947200", "AffiliationID": "60024690", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Earth Sciences, Ferrara University"}, "7005373834": {"Name": "Dickens G.R.", "AuthorID": "7005373834", "AffiliationID": "60005286", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences, Rice University"}, "13004692700": {"Name": "Wade B.S.", "AuthorID": "13004692700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "57190496813": {"Name": "Turner S.K.", "AuthorID": "57190496813", "AffiliationID": "60029526", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University of California, Riverside"}}}
