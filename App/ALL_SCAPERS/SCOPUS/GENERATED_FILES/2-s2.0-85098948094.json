We constrain the H I content and kinematics of the CGM and IGM in a physically motivated model, using the galaxy-Ly \u03b1 forest clustering data from spectroscopic galaxy surveys in quasar fields at z \u223c 2\u22123. This enables us to quantify the impact of the CGM/IGM on Ly \u03b1 emission in an observationally constrained, realistic cosmological environment. Our model predicts that the CGM and IGM at these redshifts transmit \u224880 per cent of Ly \u03b1 photons after having escaped from galaxies. This implies that while the interstellar medium primarily regulates Ly \u03b1 escape, the CGM has a non-negligible impact on the observed Ly \u03b1 line properties and the inferred Ly \u03b1 escape fraction, even at z \u223c 2\u22123. Ly \u03b1 scattering in the CGM and IGM further introduces an environmental dependence in the (apparent) Ly \u03b1 escape fraction, and the observed population of Ly\u03b1 emitting galaxies: the CGM/IGM more strongly suppresses direct Ly \u03b1 emission from galaxies in overdense regions in the Universe, and redistributes this emission into brighter Ly \u03b1 haloes. The resulting mean surface brightness profile of the Ly \u03b1 haloes is generally found to be a power law \u221dr\u22122.4. Although our model still contains arbitrariness, our results demonstrate how (integral field) spectroscopic surveys of galaxies in QSO fields constrain circumgalactic Ly \u03b1 RT, and we discuss the potential of these models for studying CGM physics and cosmology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Galaxies: high-redshift", "Intergalactic medium", "Line: formation", "Quasars: absorption lines", "Radiative transfer"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85098948094", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"55413049700": {"Name": "Kakiichi K.", "AuthorID": "55413049700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57203088176": {"Name": "Dijkstra M.", "AuthorID": "57203088176", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics, University of Oslo"}}}
