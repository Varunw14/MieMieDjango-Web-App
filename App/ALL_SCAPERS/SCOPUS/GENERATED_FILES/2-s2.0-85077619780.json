We aimed to study the association between adherence to the Dutch dietary guidelines and incidence of HF. Methods: We studied 37,468 participants aged 20\u201370 years and free of HF at baseline from the EPIC-NL cohort. At baseline (1993\u20131997), data were collected on demographics, lifestyle, and presence of chronic diseases. Dietary intake was assessed using a 178-item validated food frequency questionnaire. Dietary intake data were used to calculate scores on the Dutch Healthy Diet 2015 Index (DHD15-index) measuring adherence to the Dutch dietary guidelines. The DHD15-index is based on the average daily intake of 14 food groups resulting in a total score ranging between 0 and 140, with higher scores indicating better adherence. HF morbidity and mortality during follow-up were ascertained through linkage with national registries. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the association between DHD15 adherence and HF risk, adjusting for sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics. Results: The average score on the DHD15-index was 71 (SD = 15). During a median follow-up of 15.2 years (IQR 14.1\u201316.5), 674 HF events occurred. After adjustment for demographic and lifestyle characteristics, higher scores on the DHD15-index were associated with lower risk of HF (HRQ4vsQ1 0.73; 95% CI 0.58\u20130.93; Ptrend 0.001). Conclusion: In a large Dutch population of middle-aged adults, higher adherence to the Dutch dietary guidelines was associated with lower risk of HF.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dietary patterns", "Dutch dietary guidelines", "Dutch Healthy Diet 2015 Index", "Heart failure"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077619780", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"57203017660": {"Name": "Harbers M.C.", "AuthorID": "57203017660", "AffiliationID": "60032724, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University"}, "57213145891": {"Name": "de Kroon A.M.", "AuthorID": "57213145891", "AffiliationID": "60032724, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University"}, "7003301273": {"Name": "Verschuren W.M.M.", "AuthorID": "7003301273", "AffiliationID": "60026125", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nutrition, Prevention and Health Services, National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM)"}, "57207892519": {"Name": "van der Schouw Y.T.", "AuthorID": "57207892519", "AffiliationID": "60032724, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University"}, "26021560500": {"Name": "Sluijs I.", "AuthorID": "26021560500", "AffiliationID": "60032724, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University"}, "56903859500": {"Name": "Boer J.M.A.", "AuthorID": "56903859500", "AffiliationID": "60026125", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nutrition, Prevention and Health Services, National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM)"}, "57202567488": {"Name": "Asselbergs F.W.", "AuthorID": "57202567488", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Data Research UK and Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}, "35195702500": {"Name": "Geleijnse J.M.", "AuthorID": "35195702500", "AffiliationID": "60004156", "AffiliationName": "Division of Human Nutrition and Health, Wageningen University"}}}
