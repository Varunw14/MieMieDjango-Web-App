In this paper, we describe key issues for the next generation of stroke recovery treatment trials and present the Stroke Recovery and Rehabilitation Roundtable Trials Development Framework (SRRR-TDF). An exemplar (an upper limb recovery trial) is presented to demonstrate the utility of this framework to guide the GO, NO-GO decision-making process in trial development.", "AuthorKeywords": ["consensus", "GO NO-GO", "recovery", "rehabilitation", "Stroke", "trial design"], "IndexKeywords": ["Clinical Trials as Topic", "Congresses as Topic", "Consensus", "Decision Making", "Humans", "International Cooperation", "Motivation", "Movement", "Patient Selection", "Physical Functional Performance", "Recovery of Function", "Rehabilitation Research", "Stroke", "Stroke Rehabilitation", "Upper Extremity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074232396", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"]], "AuthorData": {"57211144389": {"Name": "Bernhardt J.", "AuthorID": "57211144389", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60110201", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Theme and NHRMC CRE in Stroke Rehabilitation and Brain Recovery, Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, University of Melbourne"}, "36600190500": {"Name": "Hayward K.S.", "AuthorID": "36600190500", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60110201", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Theme and NHRMC CRE in Stroke Rehabilitation and Brain Recovery, Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, University of Melbourne"}, "6506620066": {"Name": "Dancause N.", "AuthorID": "6506620066", "AffiliationID": "60009507", "AffiliationName": "D\u00e9partement de Neurosciences, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"}, "6602527646": {"Name": "Lannin N.A.", "AuthorID": "6602527646", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60189664, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Central Clinical School, Monash University, Alfred Health"}, "7102178423": {"Name": "Ward N.S.", "AuthorID": "7102178423", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Motor Neuroscience, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "7004203300": {"Name": "Nudo R.J.", "AuthorID": "7004203300", "AffiliationID": "60007828", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center"}, "57203614379": {"Name": "Farrin A.", "AuthorID": "57203614379", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Clinical Trial Research, University of Leeds"}, "55760633900": {"Name": "Churilov L.", "AuthorID": "55760633900", "AffiliationID": "60118549, 60026553", "AffiliationName": "Melbourne Medical School, University of Melbourne"}, "7101895712": {"Name": "Boyd L.A.", "AuthorID": "7101895712", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physical Therapy & Centre for Brain Health, University of British Columbia"}, "55446291300": {"Name": "Jones T.A.", "AuthorID": "55446291300", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Psychology Department and Institute for Neuroscience, University of Texas at Austin"}, "7103352670": {"Name": "Carmichael S.T.", "AuthorID": "7103352670", "AffiliationID": "60005247, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA"}, "7006245388": {"Name": "Corbett D.", "AuthorID": "7006245388", "AffiliationID": "60028897", "AffiliationName": "Cellular & Molecular Medicine and Canadian Partnership for Stroke Recovery, University of Ottawa"}, "54790581600": {"Name": "Cramer S.C.", "AuthorID": "54790581600", "AffiliationID": "60005247, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, California Rehabilitation Institute"}}}
