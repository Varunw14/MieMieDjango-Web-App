The effect of cranial neurosurgery per se on lumbar WCC is not established. At this single centre, many patients undergo ICPM followed by lumboperitoneal shunt (LPS), with lumbar CSF WCC samples taken during insertion. We aimed to determine the effect of ICP bolt insertion on lumbar CSF WCC. We undertook a retrospective analysis of lumbar CSF samples in patients who had recently undergone 24-h ICPM. Thirty-three patients (16F:7M) aged 43.31 \u00b1 12.1 years (mean \u00b1 SD) had lumbar CSF samples after ICPM. Fourteen had CSF sampled within 6 weeks and 19 after 6 weeks of ICPM. Twenty-five samples were taken during LPS insertion, 5 during lumbar drainage/puncture and 3 during LPS revision. All 33 patients were afebrile at the point of CSF sampling. The mean lumbar WCC within 6 weeks of ICPM was significantly higher than the mean lumbar WCC after 6 weeks, being 15.4 \u00b1 18.0 and 2.32 \u00b1 1.79 cells/microlitre respectively respectively. There was no significant increase in RBC. In patients with raised CSF WCC, 60% of raised WCC were predominantly lymphoctyes and 40% predominantly neutrophils. Only one patient grew an organism (S. aureus). We conclude that lumbar CSF WCC can be raised following minor intracranial surgery, despite no clinical sign of infection. We caution against using lumbar CSF WCC values independently as the only marker of infection following neurosurgery.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aseptic meningitis", "Cerebrospinal fluid", "Infection", "Intracranial pressure", "Lumboperitoneal shunt", "Red cell count", "White cell count"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Cerebrospinal Fluid", "Female", "Humans", "Leukocyte Count", "Leukocytosis", "Lumbosacral Region", "Male", "Meningitis, Aseptic", "Middle Aged", "Neurosurgical Procedures", "Neutrophils", "Retrospective Studies", "Spinal Puncture", "Staphylococcus aureus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083713996", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"56419604800": {"Name": "Craven C.L.", "AuthorID": "56419604800", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "24069969200": {"Name": "Asif H.", "AuthorID": "24069969200", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "24511900500": {"Name": "Curtis C.", "AuthorID": "24511900500", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57192996092": {"Name": "Thompson S.D.", "AuthorID": "57192996092", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57194971999": {"Name": "D'Antona L.", "AuthorID": "57194971999", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57216504602": {"Name": "Ramos J.", "AuthorID": "57216504602", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7005963244": {"Name": "Thorne L.", "AuthorID": "7005963244", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7102438957": {"Name": "Watkins L.D.", "AuthorID": "7102438957", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "22958811100": {"Name": "Toma A.K.", "AuthorID": "22958811100", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
