Specifically, we compare the micro-situational contexts in which sexual offences against adult females are disrupted to those in which these offences are completed. Data on sexual crime events was collected from 138 adult males who were incarcerated for committing a sexual offence against a woman using a self-report questionnaire incorporating a crime-script framework. We found that the presence or availability of a guardian does not guarantee offence disruption. Rather, action taken by the guardian is the critical factor which determines a sexual offender\u2019s decision to cease the offence.", "AuthorKeywords": ["guardianship", "offender decision-making", "sexual offending", "situational crime prevention"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091685905", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"55884385200": {"Name": "Cook A.", "AuthorID": "55884385200", "AffiliationID": "60032987", "AffiliationName": "Griffith University"}, "16052675100": {"Name": "Leclerc B.", "AuthorID": "16052675100", "AffiliationID": "60032987", "AffiliationName": "Griffith University"}, "24073266100": {"Name": "Reynald D.M.", "AuthorID": "24073266100", "AffiliationID": "60032987", "AffiliationName": "Griffith University"}, "6603079491": {"Name": "Wortley R.", "AuthorID": "6603079491", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
