However, fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) polymeric auxetic architectures with a tailored hierarchically porous structure and desired physical/mechanical properties remains challenging. Herein, 3D nanofibrous Kevlar aerogel architectures with porosity at multiple scales have been designed and fabricated through a new additive manufacturing strategy, i.e., integration of direct ink writing and freeze-casting with non-toxic solvent-based inks followed by special drying techniques. The highly porous 3D nanofibrous Kevlar aerogel architectures achieve excellent mechanical properties with an ultralow density (down to 11.9 mg cm-3) and large specific surface area (up to 350 m2 g-1). The Poisson's ratio is tunable in a wide range, spanning from -0.8 to 0.4, by adjusting the spatial arrangement of the designed pattern struts. Finally, these nanofibrous Kevlar aerogel architectures have been further functionalized into hydrophobic, luminescent and thermoresponsive architectures by using fluorocarbon resin, functional dyes and organic phase-change materials respectively. The multi-functional auxetic aerogel architectures demonstrate potential for a broad range of applications.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Hierarchically porous", "Large specific surface areas", "Manufacturing techniques", "Multiple functionalization", "Negative poisson's ratios", "Spatial arrangements", "Threedimensional (3-d)", "Ultra-low densities"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088707557", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57218304912": {"Name": "Cheng Q.", "AuthorID": "57218304912", "AffiliationID": "60117396, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "56006145000": {"Name": "Lyu J.", "AuthorID": "56006145000", "AffiliationID": "60117396, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "8229657900": {"Name": "Zhang X.", "AuthorID": "8229657900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomaterials in Surgical Reconstruction and Regeneration, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "57214950372": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "57214950372", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Imperial College"}, "57218305455": {"Name": "Lu Q.", "AuthorID": "57218305455", "AffiliationID": "60010432", "AffiliationName": "National Engineering Laboratory for Modern Silk, Soochow University"}, "7401655806": {"Name": "Song W.", "AuthorID": "7401655806", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomaterials in Surgical Reconstruction and Regeneration, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}}}
