All rights reserved.Importance: The degree to which children and adolescents are infected by and transmit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is unclear. The role of children and adolescents in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on susceptibility, symptoms, viral load, social contact patterns, and behavior. Objective: To systematically review the susceptibility to and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among children and adolescents compared with adults. Data Sources: PubMed and medRxiv were searched from database inception to July 28, 2020, and a total of 13926 studies were identified, with additional studies identified through hand searching of cited references and professional contacts. Study Selection: Studies that provided data on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in children and adolescents (younger than 20 years) compared with adults (20 years and older) derived from contact tracing or population screening were included. Single-household studies were excluded. Data Extraction and Synthesis: PRISMA guidelines for abstracting data were followed, which was performed independently by 2 reviewers. Quality was assessed using a critical appraisal checklist for prevalence studies. Random-effects meta-Analysis was undertaken. Main Outcomes and Measures: Secondary infection rate (contact-Tracing studies) or prevalence or seroprevalence (population screening studies) among children and adolescents compared with adults. Results: A total of 32 studies comprising 41640 children and adolescents and 268945 adults met inclusion criteria, including 18 contact-Tracing studies and 14 population screening studies. The pooled odds ratio of being an infected contact in children compared with adults was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.37-0.85), with substantial heterogeneity (I2= 94.6%). Three school-based contact-Tracing studies found minimal transmission from child or teacher index cases. Findings from population screening studies were heterogenous and were not suitable for meta-Analysis. Most studies were consistent with lower seroprevalence in children compared with adults, although seroprevalence in adolescents appeared similar to adults. Conclusions and Relevance: In this meta-Analysis, there is preliminary evidence that children and adolescents have lower susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, with an odds ratio of 0.56 for being an infected contact compared with adults. There is weak evidence that children and adolescents play a lesser role than adults in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at a population level. This study provides no information on the infectivity of children.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092134320", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"7005899067": {"Name": "Viner R.M.", "AuthorID": "7005899067", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57189990192": {"Name": "Ward J.", "AuthorID": "57189990192", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "36522974400": {"Name": "Hudson L.", "AuthorID": "36522974400", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57205198724": {"Name": "Russell S.", "AuthorID": "57205198724", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "16231103900": {"Name": "Mytton O.T.", "AuthorID": "16231103900", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60009969", "AffiliationName": "MRC Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge"}, "6602743765": {"Name": "Bonell C.", "AuthorID": "6602743765", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57189230856": {"Name": "Davies N.G.", "AuthorID": "57189230856", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57221719891": {"Name": "Eggo R.M.", "AuthorID": "57221719891", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57188672699": {"Name": "Melendez-Torres G.J.", "AuthorID": "57188672699", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine and Health, University of Exeter"}, "36132561400": {"Name": "Waddington C.", "AuthorID": "36132561400", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "55574208406": {"Name": "Thomas J.", "AuthorID": "55574208406", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "36901950500": {"Name": "Van Der Klis F.", "AuthorID": "36901950500", "AffiliationID": "60026125", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM)"}, "57204087581": {"Name": "Koirala A.", "AuthorID": "57204087581", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "University of Sydney"}, "7006741817": {"Name": "Booy R.", "AuthorID": "7006741817", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "University of Sydney"}, "57203627482": {"Name": "Ladhani S.", "AuthorID": "57203627482", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "St George's University of London"}, "55390602700": {"Name": "Panovska-Griffiths J.", "AuthorID": "55390602700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}}}
