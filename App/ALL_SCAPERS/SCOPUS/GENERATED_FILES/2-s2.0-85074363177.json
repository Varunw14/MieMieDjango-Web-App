However, BIF are deficient in OM, which is postulated to be the result of near-complete oxidation of OM during iron reduction. We test this idea by documenting the prevalence of OM in clays within BIF and clays in shales associated with BIF. We find in shales >80% of OM occurs in clays, but <1% occurs in clays within BIF. Instead, in BIF OM occurs with 13C-depleted carbonate and apatite, implying OM oxidation occurred. Conversely, BIF which possess primary clays would be expected to preserve OM in clays, yet this is not seen. This implies OM deposition in silicate-bearing BIF would have been minimal, this consequently stifled iron-cycling and primary productivity through the retention of nutrients in the sediments.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074363177", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57193520412": {"Name": "Dodd M.S.", "AuthorID": "57193520412", "AffiliationID": "60006019", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Biogeology and Environmental Geology, China University of Geosciences"}, "9638888200": {"Name": "Papineau D.", "AuthorID": "9638888200", "AffiliationID": "60006019", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth Sciences & State Key Laboratory of Biogeology and Environmental Geology, China University of Geosciences"}, "7003614919": {"Name": "Pirajno F.", "AuthorID": "7003614919", "AffiliationID": "60031806, 60189098", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Exploration Targeting, The University of Western Australia"}, "7402417226": {"Name": "Wan Y.", "AuthorID": "7402417226", "AffiliationID": "60109828, 60061261", "AffiliationName": "Beijing SHRIMP Centre, Institute of Geology, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences"}, "7005407768": {"Name": "Karhu J.A.", "AuthorID": "7005407768", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geosciences and Geography, University of Helsinki"}}}
