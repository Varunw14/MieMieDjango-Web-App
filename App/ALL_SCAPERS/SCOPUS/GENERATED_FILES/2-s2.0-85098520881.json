In this paper, we construct axisymmetric Jeans dynamical models of the NSD based on previous photometric studies and we fit them to line-of-sight kinematic data of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) and silicon monoxide (SiO) maser stars. We find that (i) the NSD mass is lower but consistent with the mass independently determined from photometry by Launhardt et al. Our fiducial model has a mass contained within spherical radius r = 100 pc of M(r < 100 pc) = 3.9 \u00b1 1 \u00d7 108 M\u2609 and a total mass of MNSD = 6.9 \u00b1 2 \u00d7 108 M\u2609. (ii) The NSD might be the first example of a vertically biased disc, i.e. with ratio between the vertical and radial velocity dispersion \u03c3z/\u03c3R > 1. Observations and theoretical models of the star-forming molecular gas in the central molecular zone suggest that large vertical oscillations may be already imprinted at stellar birth. However, the finding \u03c3z/\u03c3R > 1 depends on a drop in the velocity dispersion in the innermost few tens of parsecs, on our assumption that the NSD is axisymmetric, and that the available (extinction corrected) stellar samples broadly trace the underlying light and mass distributions, all of which need to be established by future observations and/or modelling. (iii) We provide the most accurate rotation curve to date for the innermost 500 pc of our Galaxy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Galaxy: centre", "Galaxy: kinematics and dynamics", "Galaxy: structure"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85098520881", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"55631744400": {"Name": "Sormani M.C.", "AuthorID": "55631744400", "AffiliationID": "60016908", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Theoretische Astrophysik, Zentrum f\u00fcr Astronomie, Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg"}, "57203254582": {"Name": "Klessen R.S.", "AuthorID": "57203254582", "AffiliationID": "60016908", "AffiliationName": "Interdisziplin\u00e4res Zentrum f\u00fcr Wissenschaftliches Rechnen, Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg"}, "6602198986": {"Name": "Magorrian J.", "AuthorID": "6602198986", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Rudolf Peierls Centre for Theoretical Physics, Clarendon Laboratory"}, "56817007800": {"Name": "Nogueras-Lara F.", "AuthorID": "56817007800", "AffiliationID": "60007268", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Astronomy"}, "23968255700": {"Name": "Neumayer N.", "AuthorID": "23968255700", "AffiliationID": "60007268", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Astronomy"}, "26642272800": {"Name": "Sch\u00f6nrich R.", "AuthorID": "26642272800", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "35174814200": {"Name": "Mastrobuono-Battisti A.", "AuthorID": "35174814200", "AffiliationID": "60007271, 60118588", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy and Theoretical Physics, Lund Observatory"}}}
