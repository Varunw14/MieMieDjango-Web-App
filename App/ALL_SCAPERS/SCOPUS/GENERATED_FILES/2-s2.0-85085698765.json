Recent policies suggest moving towards better community-based care for dementia; however, little is known on how this care is delivered. This study aimed to map the post-diagnostic dementia support provided in England a decade after the introduction of a National Dementia Strategy. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed-methods e-survey (open Nov 2018\u2013Mar 2019) of dementia commissioners in England recruited through mailing lists of relevant organisations was conducted. The authors descriptively summarised quantitative data and carried out thematic analysis of open-ended survey responses. Findings: 52 completed responses were received, which covered 82 commissioning bodies, with representation from each region in England. Respondents reported great variation in the types of services provided. Information, caregiver assessments and dementia navigation were commonly reported and usually delivered by the voluntary sector or local authorities. Integrated pathways of care were seen as important to avoid overlap or gaps in service coverage. Despite an increasingly diverse population, few areas reported providing dementia health services specifically for BME populations. Over half of providers planned to change services further within five years. Practical implications: There is a need for greater availability of and consistency in services in post-diagnostic dementia care across England. Originality/value: Post-diagnostic dementia care remains fragmented and provided by a wide range of providers in England.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Health and social care", "Integrated care", "Integrated health and social care", "Local government", "Long-term conditions", "Voluntary and community sector"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085698765", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Public Administration", "SOCI", "3321"]], "AuthorData": {"57191471812": {"Name": "Frost R.", "AuthorID": "57191471812", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57203175207": {"Name": "Walters K.", "AuthorID": "57203175207", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "35239306300": {"Name": "Wilcock J.", "AuthorID": "35239306300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6602151058": {"Name": "Rait G.", "AuthorID": "6602151058", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "16835708800": {"Name": "Robinson L.", "AuthorID": "16835708800", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Newcastle University"}, "36893703900": {"Name": "Harrison Dening K.", "AuthorID": "36893703900", "AffiliationID": "60112890", "AffiliationName": "Dementia UK"}, "57220660009": {"Name": "Knapp M.", "AuthorID": "57220660009", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "LSE"}, "57219322239": {"Name": "Allan L.", "AuthorID": "57219322239", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter"}}}
