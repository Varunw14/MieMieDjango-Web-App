The av-Guardian vascular access system (Advent Access, Singapore) is designed to overcome the technical barrier to establishing reliable blunt needle access in patients with mature arteriovenous fistula. Methods: This was a first-in-man, prospective, non-randomized trial (registered on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (ACTRN12617000501347)) performed to assess the safety and feasibility of achieving repeatable successful cannulation via av-Guardian vascular access system to facilitate blunt needling in patients with mature arteriovenous fistula. The primary endpoints of the study included rate of successful hemodialysis sessions via av-Guardian vascular access system cannulation over 3 months and safety of the implants. Results: A total of six patients (four patients with brachiocephalic and two with radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula) were enrolled in the study. A pair of av-Guardian vascular access system were implanted, one each at the arterial and venous cannulation sites, under local anesthesia. Overall, the rate of successful cannulation through the av-Guardian vascular access system over 3 months in 216 hemodialysis sessions was 98.1% (212/216) at the arterial site and 94.4% (204/216) at the venous site. Significantly, 90% and 85.5% of the cannulations at the arterial and venous site, respectively, were successful at first attempt. Blood flow rates within the arteriovenous fistula were unaffected by the devices. Conclusion: The results demonstrated the safety and feasibility of a subcutaneously implanted, extravascular device in achieving repeatable successful cannulation via a constant site, to facilitate blunt needling in matured arteriovenous fistula in limited number of patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["arteriovenous fistula", "cannulation techniques", "Hemodialysis", "novel device"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Arteriovenous Shunt, Surgical", "Catheterization", "Equipment Design", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Kidney Failure, Chronic", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Non-Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Prospective Studies", "Renal Dialysis", "Singapore", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome", "Vascular Access Devices"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077684994", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"26029247900": {"Name": "Tan C.S.", "AuthorID": "26029247900", "AffiliationID": "60017958", "AffiliationName": "Department of Renal Medicine, Singapore General Hospital"}, "57193828073": {"Name": "Tan R.Y.", "AuthorID": "57193828073", "AffiliationID": "60017958", "AffiliationName": "Department of Renal Medicine, Singapore General Hospital"}, "57194102674": {"Name": "Liu P.", "AuthorID": "57194102674", "AffiliationID": "60017958", "AffiliationName": "Department of Renal Medicine, Singapore General Hospital"}, "57203655099": {"Name": "Choong L.H.L.", "AuthorID": "57203655099", "AffiliationID": "60017958", "AffiliationName": "Department of Renal Medicine, Singapore General Hospital"}, "57214662562": {"Name": "Tan S.G.", "AuthorID": "57214662562", "AffiliationID": "60017958", "AffiliationName": "Department of Vascular Surgery, Singapore General Hospital"}, "13008545700": {"Name": "Choke E.T.C.", "AuthorID": "13008545700", "AffiliationID": "60017958", "AffiliationName": "Department of Vascular Surgery, Singapore General Hospital"}, "34969787300": {"Name": "Wong C.L.J.", "AuthorID": "34969787300", "AffiliationID": "60106366", "AffiliationName": "Division of Vascular Surgery, Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular Surgery (CTVS), National University Heart Centre"}, "22939781700": {"Name": "Wee B.", "AuthorID": "22939781700", "AffiliationID": "60031325", "AffiliationName": "Division of Interventional Radiology, Department of Diagnostic Imaging, National University Hospital"}, "56486602000": {"Name": "Wong W.K.", "AuthorID": "56486602000", "AffiliationID": "60106366", "AffiliationName": "Division of Nephrology, University Medicine Cluster, National University Health System"}, "57220736739": {"Name": "Lau T.", "AuthorID": "57220736739", "AffiliationID": "60106366", "AffiliationName": "Division of Nephrology, University Medicine Cluster, National University Health System"}, "56266099800": {"Name": "Homer-Vanniasinkam S.", "AuthorID": "56266099800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
