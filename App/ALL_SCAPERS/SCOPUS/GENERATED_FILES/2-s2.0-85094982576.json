In this paper we test the hypothesis that mimicry is moderated by the mere knowledge of whether the source is a member of the same social category as ourselves. Methods We investigated group influence on mimicry using three tasks on a software platform which interfaces with mobile computing devices to allow the controlled study of collective behaviour in an everyday environment. Results Overall, participants (N = 965) were influenced by the movements of confederates (represented as dots on a screen) who belonged to their own category in both purposive and incidental tasks. Conclusion Our results are compatible with collective level explanations of social influence premised on shared social identification. This includes both a heuristic of unintended mimicry (the acts of group members are diagnostic of how one should act), and communication of affiliation (based on a desire to make one\u2019s group cohesive). The results are incompatible with traditional \u2018contagion\u2019 accounts which suggest mimicry is automatic and inevitable. The results have practical implications for designing behavioural interventions which can harness the power of copying behaviour, for example in emergency evacuations.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Child", "Female", "Group Processes", "Humans", "Imitative Behavior", "Interpersonal Relations", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Social Identification", "Software", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094982576", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55177992500": {"Name": "Neville F.G.", "AuthorID": "55177992500", "AffiliationID": "60022132", "AffiliationName": "School of Management, University of St Andrews"}, "7005034087": {"Name": "Drury J.", "AuthorID": "7005034087", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Sussex"}, "57201981213": {"Name": "Choudhury S.", "AuthorID": "57201981213", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Sussex"}, "57201977658": {"Name": "Ball R.", "AuthorID": "57201977658", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Sussex"}, "55405141800": {"Name": "Reicher S.D.", "AuthorID": "55405141800", "AffiliationID": "60022132", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology and Neuroscience, University of St Andrews"}, "7003750851": {"Name": "Stott C.", "AuthorID": "7003750851", "AffiliationID": "60030210", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Keele University"}, "7403445239": {"Name": "Richardson D.C.", "AuthorID": "7403445239", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}}}
