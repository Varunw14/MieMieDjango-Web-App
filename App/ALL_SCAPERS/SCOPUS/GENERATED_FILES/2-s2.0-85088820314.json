Methods: A cohort study of 217 individuals (median age 80, IQR 74\u201385 years; 62% men) hospitalised with COVID-19, followed up for all-cause mortality, was conducted. Secondary outcomes included cognitive and physical function at discharge. C-reactive protein and neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio were used as measures of immune activity. Results: Cardinal COVID-19 symptoms (fever, dyspnoea, cough) were common but not universal. Inflammation on hospitalisation was lower in frail older adults. Fever, dyspnoea, delirium and inflammation were associated with mortality. Delirium at presentation was an independent risk factor for cognitive decline at discharge. Conclusions: COVID-19 may present without cardinal symptoms as well as implicate a possible role for age-related changes in immunity in mediating the relationship between frailty and mortality.", "AuthorKeywords": ["COVID-19", "Epidemiology", "Immune dysfunction", "Mortality", "Post-hospitalisation outcomes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Accidental Falls", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "COVID-19", "Delirium", "Dyspnea", "Female", "Frailty", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Male", "Risk Factors", "SARS-CoV-2"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088820314", "SubjectAreas": [["Gerontology", "NURS", "2909"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"35311122400": {"Name": "Knopp P.", "AuthorID": "35311122400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine for the Elderly, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57218127964": {"Name": "Miles A.", "AuthorID": "57218127964", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine for the Elderly, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57218116410": {"Name": "Webb T.E.", "AuthorID": "57218116410", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine for the Elderly, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57218124106": {"Name": "Mcloughlin B.C.", "AuthorID": "57218124106", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine for the Elderly, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57213158831": {"Name": "Mannan I.", "AuthorID": "57213158831", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine for the Elderly, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57213166672": {"Name": "Raja N.", "AuthorID": "57213166672", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine for the Elderly, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57194202645": {"Name": "Wan B.", "AuthorID": "57194202645", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine for the Elderly, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55350725000": {"Name": "Davis D.", "AuthorID": "55350725000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Department of Population Science and Experimental Medicine, MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL"}}}
