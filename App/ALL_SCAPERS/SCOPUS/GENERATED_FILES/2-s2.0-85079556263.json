All rights reserved.Synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1) synchronizes neurotransmitter release to action potentials (APs) acting as the fast Ca2+ release sensor and as the inhibitor (clamp) of spontaneous and delayed asynchronous release. While the Syt1 Ca2+ activation mechanism has been well-characterized, how Syt1 clamps transmitter release remains enigmatic. Here we show that C2B domain-dependent oligomerization provides the molecular basis for the Syt1 clamping function. This follows from the investigation of a designed mutation (F349A), which selectively destabilizes Syt1 oligomerization. Using a combination of fluorescence imaging and electrophysiology in neocortical synapses, we show that Syt1F349A is more efficient than wild-type Syt1 (Syt1WT) in triggering synchronous transmitter release but fails to clamp spontaneous and synaptotagmin 7 (Syt7)-mediated asynchronous release components both in rescue (Syt1\u2212/\u2212 knockout background) and dominant-interference (Syt1+/+ background) conditions. Thus, we conclude that Ca2+-sensitive Syt1 oligomers, acting as an exocytosis clamp, are critical for maintaining the balance among the different modes of neurotransmitter release.", "AuthorKeywords": ["C2B domain", "Fusion clamp", "Synaptic transmission", "Synaptotagmin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Exocytosis", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Mutation, Missense", "Neurotransmitter Agents", "Synapses", "Synaptic Transmission", "Synaptotagmin I"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079556263", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55556274600": {"Name": "Tagliatti E.", "AuthorID": "55556274600", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "54911686500": {"Name": "Bello O.D.", "AuthorID": "54911686500", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, Yale University School of Medicine"}, "57188834377": {"Name": "Mendon\u00e7a P.R.F.", "AuthorID": "57188834377", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57220216998": {"Name": "Kotzadimitriou D.", "AuthorID": "57220216998", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "55363321300": {"Name": "Nicholson E.", "AuthorID": "55363321300", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "6602184020": {"Name": "Timofeeva Y.", "AuthorID": "6602184020", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Complexity Science, University of Warwick"}, "7103209478": {"Name": "Rothman J.E.", "AuthorID": "7103209478", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, Yale University School of Medicine"}, "16245253100": {"Name": "Krishnakumar S.S.", "AuthorID": "16245253100", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, Yale University School of Medicine"}, "6603211980": {"Name": "Volynski K.E.", "AuthorID": "6603211980", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, Yale University School of Medicine"}, "57188679739": {"Name": "Coleman J.", "AuthorID": "57188679739", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, Yale University School of Medicine"}}}
