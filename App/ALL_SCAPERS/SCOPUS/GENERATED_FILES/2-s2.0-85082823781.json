Previous reports have linked recovery time to intra-dialytic hypotension and rapid solute clearances, whereas others have reported an association with psychological factors. As such, we wished to investigate which factors were important in determining symptom self-reporting and delayed recovery times. Methods: We recorded self-reported patient intra-dialytic symptoms, recovery times along with sessional dialysis prescriptions, blood pressure and urea clearance, and distress thermometer scores to assess psychological factors. Findings: Six hundred twenty-Three dialysis patients were studied; 621 treated by haemodiafiltration, 60.8% male, mean age 64.5 \u00b1 16.2 years, and 46.1% diabetic. Almost half (49.6%) reported recovery within 1 h. On multivariate analysis, patient self-reported symptom scores were associated with longer post-dialysis recovery times (odds ratio (OR) 1.61, 95% confidence limits (CL) 1.33-1.95), higher distress thermometer scores (OR 1.3 CL (1.3-1.39), but lower hand grip strength (OR 0.85 CL (0.93-0.94), all p < 0.001, and younger rather than older patients (OR 0.98 CL (0.97-0.99) p = 0.005. We found no association with ultrafiltration rates or weight loss. Discussion: Compared to earlier studies, our patients treated by haemodiafiltration reported fewer symptoms and shorter recovery times. Patients with higher self-reported distress thermometer scores had both longer post-dialysis recovery times and greater dialysis symptom scores. Younger patients reported more dialysis symptoms and longer recovery times than older patients. Future studies investigating patient self-reported recovery times and dialysis-Associated symptoms should also consider interventions to reduce patient psychological factors as well as dialysis practices.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cramps", "Distress thermometer", "Haemodialysis", "Hand grip strength", "Headaches"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082823781", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"], ["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"57195753742": {"Name": "Yoowannakul S.", "AuthorID": "57195753742", "AffiliationID": "60022738", "AffiliationName": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Bhumibol Adulyadej Hospital"}, "56664498100": {"Name": "Tangvoraphonkchai K.", "AuthorID": "56664498100", "AffiliationID": "60002875", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Mahasarakham University"}, "55437680000": {"Name": "Davenport A.", "AuthorID": "55437680000", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Nephrology, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
