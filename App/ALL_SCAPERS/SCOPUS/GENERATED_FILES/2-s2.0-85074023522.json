However, little research has examined the impact of disordered personality traits in mothers on these outcomes. We investigated the association between disordered personality traits in mothers measured during pregnancy and postnatal (a) self-reported bonding with infant; (b) observational mother\u2013infant interactions. Methods: Five hundred fifty-six women were recruited during early pregnancy and subsequently followed up at mid-pregnancy (approximately 28 weeks\u2019 gestation) and when infants were aged approximately 3 months (n = 459). During early pregnancy, data were collected on disordered personality traits (using the Standardised Assessment of Personality Abbreviated Scale) and depressive symptoms (using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale). At 3 months postpartum, self-reported perceived bonding (using the Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire) were collected. A sub-sample of women additionally provided observational mother\u2013infant interaction data (n = 206) (coded using the Child\u2013Adult Relationship Experimental Index). Results: Higher disordered personality traits was not associated with maternal perceptions of bonding impairment, but was associated with reduced maternal sensitivity during observational mother\u2013infant interactions [adjusted for age, education, having older children, substance misuse prior to pregnancy, infant sex and gestational age: coefficient = \u2212 0.28, 95% CI = \u2212 0.56 to \u2212 0.00, p < 0.05]. After adjusting for depressive symptoms, the association was attenuated [coefficient = \u2212 0.19, 95% CI = \u2212 0.48 to 0.11, p = 0.217]. Conclusions: Mothers with disordered personality traits did not perceive themselves as having bonding impairments with their infants but were less sensitive during observed interactions, though depressive symptoms attenuated this relationship. Both depression and disordered personality traits need to be addressed to optimize mother\u2013infant interactions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bonding", "Depressive symptoms", "Disordered personality traits", "Mother\u2013infant interaction", "Pregnancy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Depression, Postpartum", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "London", "Middle Aged", "Mother-Child Relations", "Mothers", "Personality Disorders", "Pregnancy", "Prenatal Care", "Prospective Studies", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074023522", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57002424600": {"Name": "Nath S.", "AuthorID": "57002424600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Section of Women\u2019s Mental Health, Health Service and Population Research Department, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "42262237800": {"Name": "Molyneaux E.", "AuthorID": "42262237800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Section of Women\u2019s Mental Health, Health Service and Population Research Department, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "7202645145": {"Name": "Howard L.M.", "AuthorID": "7202645145", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Section of Women\u2019s Mental Health, Health Service and Population Research Department, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "31367590300": {"Name": "Pearson R.M.", "AuthorID": "31367590300", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Academic Mental Health, Department of Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "34571973600": {"Name": "Moran P.", "AuthorID": "34571973600", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Academic Mental Health, Department of Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "6602605462": {"Name": "Pawlby S.", "AuthorID": "6602605462", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}}}
