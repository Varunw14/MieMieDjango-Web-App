Methods: Participants had Usher syndrome type 2 (USH2, N = 80) or autosomal recessive nonsyndromic retinitis pigmentosa (ARRP, N = 47) associated with biallelic variants in the USH2A gene. Associations of demographic and clinical characteristics with BCVA, ERG, and FST were assessed with regression models. Results: In comparison to ARRP, USH2 had worse BCVA (median 79 vs. 82 letters; P < 0.001 adjusted for age), lower rod-mediated ERG b-wave amplitudes (median 0.0 vs. 6.6 \u03bcV; P < 0.001) and 30 Hz flicker cone-mediated ERG amplitudes (median 1.5 vs. 3.1 \u03bcV; P = 0.001), and higher (white, blue, and red) FST thresholds (means [\u221226, \u221231, \u221223 dB] vs. [\u221239, \u221245, \u221228 dB]; P < 0.001 for all stimuli). After adjusting for age, gender, and duration of vision loss, the difference in BCVA between diagnosis groups was attenuated (P = 0.09). Only diagnosis was associated with rod-and cone-mediated ERG parameters, whereas both genders (P = 0.04) and duration of visual loss (P < 0.001) also were associated with FST white stimulus. Conclusions: USH2 participants had worse BCVA, ERG, and FST than ARRP participants. FST was strongly associated with duration of disease; it remains to be determined whether it will be a sensitive measure of progression. Translational Relevance: Using standardized research protocols in RUSH2A, measures have been identified to monitor disease progression and treatment response and differentiate features of prognostic relevance between USH2 and ARRP participants with USH2A mutations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA)", "Electroretinography (ERG)", "Full-field stimulus test", "Retinitis pigmentosa", "Usher syndrome type 2 (USH2A)"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095995281", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"56852126400": {"Name": "Birch D.G.", "AuthorID": "56852126400", "AffiliationID": "60006874", "AffiliationName": "Retina Foundation of the Southwest"}, "57219907146": {"Name": "Cheng P.", "AuthorID": "57219907146", "AffiliationID": "60032806", "AffiliationName": "Jaeb Center for Health Research"}, "56410447600": {"Name": "Ayala A.R.", "AuthorID": "56410447600", "AffiliationID": "60032806", "AffiliationName": "Jaeb Center for Health Research"}, "7401893019": {"Name": "Duncan J.L.", "AuthorID": "7401893019", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "University of California, San Francisco"}, "35448311500": {"Name": "Maguire M.G.", "AuthorID": "35448311500", "AffiliationID": "60006297", "AffiliationName": "University of Pennsylvania"}, "6507690222": {"Name": "Audo I.", "AuthorID": "6507690222", "AffiliationID": "60004689, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Centre Hospitalier National d\u2019Ophtalmologie des Quinze-Vingts, INSERM-DGOS CIC1423"}, "57194264923": {"Name": "Cheetham J.K.", "AuthorID": "57194264923", "AffiliationID": "100863346", "AffiliationName": "Foundation Fighting Blindness"}, "57213659704": {"Name": "Durham T.A.", "AuthorID": "57213659704", "AffiliationID": "100863346", "AffiliationName": "Foundation Fighting Blindness"}, "49663267600": {"Name": "Fahim A.T.", "AuthorID": "49663267600", "AffiliationID": "60022590, 60025778", "AffiliationName": "University of Michigan, Kellogg Eye Center"}, "7401797481": {"Name": "Khan N.W.", "AuthorID": "7401797481", "AffiliationID": "60022590, 60025778", "AffiliationName": "University of Michigan, Kellogg Eye Center"}, "35408084600": {"Name": "Ferris F.L.", "AuthorID": "35408084600", "AffiliationID": "121445280", "AffiliationName": "Ophthalmic Research Consultants"}, "56803544800": {"Name": "Heon E.", "AuthorID": "56803544800", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Ophthalmology and Vision Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, The University of Toronto"}, "23570185300": {"Name": "Vincent A.", "AuthorID": "23570185300", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Ophthalmology and Vision Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, The University of Toronto"}, "55881644900": {"Name": "Huckfeldt R.M.", "AuthorID": "55881644900", "AffiliationID": "60003828", "AffiliationName": "Massachusetts Eye and Ear"}, "7004329515": {"Name": "Iannaccone A.", "AuthorID": "7004329515", "AffiliationID": "60113147", "AffiliationName": "Duke University Medical Center, Department of Ophthalmology"}, "16063815400": {"Name": "Lad E.M.", "AuthorID": "16063815400", "AffiliationID": "60113147", "AffiliationName": "Duke University Medical Center, Department of Ophthalmology"}, "57215380010": {"Name": "Michaelides M.", "AuthorID": "57215380010", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7003510165": {"Name": "Pennesi M.E.", "AuthorID": "7003510165", "AffiliationID": "60016733", "AffiliationName": "Casey Eye Institute-Oregon Health & Science University"}, "36914623700": {"Name": "Stingl K.", "AuthorID": "36914623700", "AffiliationID": "60017246", "AffiliationName": "Center for Rare Eye Diseases, University of Tuebingen"}, "57125500000": {"Name": "Weng C.Y.", "AuthorID": "57125500000", "AffiliationID": "60002441", "AffiliationName": "Baylor College of Medicine"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
