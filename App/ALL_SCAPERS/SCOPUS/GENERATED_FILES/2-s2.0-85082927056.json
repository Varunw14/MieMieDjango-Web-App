In this study, an experiment was conducted in a dining space to find methods for improving the indoor sound environment through audio-visual interaction. Differences among diners' conversation behaviours were collected on the basis of acoustic measurements before and after displaying visual media content. Acoustic perception and feelings of the diners were analysed through a survey questionnaire. Four types of content (different, dynamic, transformation, foci), three positions (front, corner, side), and three brightness levels (bright, moderate, dark) were compared. It was found that displaying visual media content reduced the sound pressure level by 2.1 dB in 10 s. Furthermore, playing media content attracted people's attention and reduced 2% of the total conversation duration among 12% of the diners, indirectly improving the acoustic environment. Last, results of the administered questionnaire show that diners' acoustic comfort and subjective perception of loudness improved within 0.53 points after media playback.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Conversation frequency", "Public indoor space", "Sound pressure level", "Subjective evaluation", "Visual media content"], "IndexKeywords": ["Conversation frequency", "Indoor space", "Sound pressure level", "Subjective evaluations", "Visual media"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082927056", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"]], "AuthorData": {"57216258787": {"Name": "Ye K.", "AuthorID": "57216258787", "AffiliationID": "60025761", "AffiliationName": "Hubei Engineering Research Center for Virtual, Safe and Automated Construction (ViSAC), HUST"}, "23976309500": {"Name": "Luo H.", "AuthorID": "23976309500", "AffiliationID": "60025761", "AffiliationName": "Hubei Engineering Research Center for Virtual, Safe and Automated Construction (ViSAC), HUST"}, "55485135500": {"Name": "Kang J.", "AuthorID": "55485135500", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering, The Bartlett, University College London (UCL)"}, "57194415409": {"Name": "Wu S.", "AuthorID": "57194415409", "AffiliationID": "60032343", "AffiliationName": "University of Huddersfield"}}}
