Drawing on a large, representative community sample of Norwegian children followed up on a biennial basis from 6 to 10 years of age (analysis sample: n = 802), child and contextual predictors (i.e., child temperament, depression symptoms, serious life events, family functioning, parental sensitivity and structuring) of change in emotional over- and undereating were examined. Results revealed that low (temperamental) soothability and less parental structuring at age 6 predicted increased emotional overeating at age 10 and that lower family functioning at age 6 predicted more emotional undereating during the same period.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adverse Childhood Experiences", "Affective Symptoms", "Child", "Child Behavior", "Child, Preschool", "Feeding and Eating Disorders", "Female", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Norway", "Parenting", "Temperament"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074742034", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"57201060918": {"Name": "Bj\u00f8rklund O.", "AuthorID": "57201060918", "AffiliationID": "60023052", "AffiliationName": "St. Olavs Hospital"}, "7004283214": {"Name": "Wichstr\u00f8m L.", "AuthorID": "7004283214", "AffiliationID": "119045763", "AffiliationName": "NTNU Social Research"}, "34873706500": {"Name": "Steinsbekk S.", "AuthorID": "34873706500", "AffiliationID": "60013141", "AffiliationName": "Norwegian University of Science and Technology"}, "24471042200": {"Name": "Llewellyn C.H.", "AuthorID": "24471042200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
