Shortcomings are largely attributed to time and resource intensive methods of historical settlement transformation study. However, developments in quantitative morphological approaches offer new possibilities for efficiency and easier adoption of research tools in practice. This paper proposes the use of typo-morphology methods to inform the adoption of form-based design guidance in neighbourhood master plans. The aim of the study is to develop a comprehensive yet flexible method for form-based character assessment (FBCA) of residential streets. The resulting FBCA classification identifies streets where compliance with form-based design rules could be tightened. The FBCA method is empirically tested in the context of the local neighbourhood plan for Radlett, Hertfordshire in the United Kingdom, offering reflections from practice on the usefulness and limitations of the method.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Character appraisal", "form-based codes", "neighbourhood plan", "spatial analysis", "typo-morphology", "united Kingdom", "urban development"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85093668089", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"56258881400": {"Name": "Palaiologou G.", "AuthorID": "56258881400", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, Building and Civil Engineering, Loughborough University"}, "55467307700": {"Name": "Larimian T.", "AuthorID": "55467307700", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, Building and Civil Engineering, Loughborough University"}, "57173841200": {"Name": "Vaughan L.", "AuthorID": "57173841200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, University College London"}}}
