We provide a new survey-experimental, choice-based approach for measuring the importance voters attach to different positional issues, including issues not currently contested by political elites. We combine information from (a) direct questions eliciting respondents' positions on different issues with (b) a conjoint experiment asking respondents to trade off departures from their preferred positions on those issues. Applying this method to study the relative importance of 34 issues in the United Kingdom, we show that British voters attach significant importance to issues like the death penalty that are not presently the subject of political debate and attach more importance to those issues associated with social liberal\u2013conservative rather than economic left\u2013right divisions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088175847", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"26633842200": {"Name": "Hanretty C.", "AuthorID": "26633842200", "AffiliationID": "60033387", "AffiliationName": "University of London"}, "16239402000": {"Name": "Lauderdale B.E.", "AuthorID": "16239402000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "14046394300": {"Name": "Vivyan N.", "AuthorID": "14046394300", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Durham University"}}}
