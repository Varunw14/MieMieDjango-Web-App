MMPTCP runs in two phases; initially, it randomly scatters packets in the network under a single congestion window exploiting all available paths. This is beneficial to latency-sensitive flows. During the second phase, MMPTCP runs in Multi-Path TCP (MPTCP) mode, which has been shown to be very efficient for long flows. Initial evaluation shows that our approach significantly improves short flow completion times while providing high throughput for long flows and high overall network utilisation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Data center", "Multi-path TCP", "NS-3", "Packet scatter"], "IndexKeywords": ["All available paths", "Completion time", "Congestion window", "Data centres", "High throughput", "Overall networks", "Sensitive flow", "Transport protocols"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086583169", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"57188679594": {"Name": "Kheirkhah M.", "AuthorID": "57188679594", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Informatics, University of Sussex"}, "13609703300": {"Name": "Wakeman I.", "AuthorID": "13609703300", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Informatics, University of Sussex"}, "45861358900": {"Name": "Parisis G.", "AuthorID": "45861358900", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Informatics, University of Sussex"}}}
