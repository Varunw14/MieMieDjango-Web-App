However, little is known about plasma exposures and safety following administration of the delayed-release tablets (DRTs) in children and adolescents. Methods: In a retrospective observational study, we analysed steady-state trough concentrations of posaconazole in all paediatric patients who had received the DRT formulation between May 2015 and December 2018 for antifungal prophylaxis. Dosing was guided by a published population pharmacokinetic model with weight-based dosing. Drug concentrations in plasma were measured by a validated tandem MS method. Liver function and drug discontinuations due to adverse effects were also assessed. Results: A total of 34 patients (21 male, 13 female; median age 12 years, range 5-17 years; median body weight 43.5 kg, range 16-84 kg) undergoing treatment for haemato-oncological disorders (n=23) or immunosuppression for polyarthritis (n=1) or post-allogeneic HSCT (n=11) received posaconazole DRTs for a median of 70 days (range 9-391 days). The median first steady-state trough plasma concentration following model-derived dosing was 1607 ng/mL (range 501-8485 ng/mL) with trough concentrations being above the dosing target of \u2265700 ng/mL in 32/34 patients (94%). Considering all (first and subsequent) trough concentrations, target attainment was 90% (63/70 samples). Posaconazole was well tolerated without adverse event-related discontinuations or breakthrough infections. Conclusions: Administration of posaconazole DRTs to paediatric patients guided by a population pharmacokinetic-derived dosing algorithm resulted in predictable and potentially effective exposures and was well tolerated over prolonged time periods.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Oral", "Adolescent", "Antifungal Agents", "Chemoprevention", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Delayed-Action Preparations", "Female", "Humans", "Immunocompromised Host", "Liver", "Liver Function Tests", "Male", "Mycoses", "Plasma", "Retrospective Studies", "Tablets", "Triazoles"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075089720", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"9041205800": {"Name": "Tragiannidis A.", "AuthorID": "9041205800", "AffiliationID": "60015331, 60026834", "AffiliationName": "Hematology Oncology Unit, 2nd Department of Pediatrics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, AHEPA Hospital"}, "57210632199": {"Name": "Herbr\u00fcggen H.", "AuthorID": "57210632199", "AffiliationID": "60006490", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Disease Research Program, Center for Bone Marrow Transplantation, Dept. of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital M\u00fcnster"}, "8867305600": {"Name": "Ahlmann M.", "AuthorID": "8867305600", "AffiliationID": "60006490", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Disease Research Program, Center for Bone Marrow Transplantation, Dept. of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital M\u00fcnster"}, "56401167800": {"Name": "Thorer H.", "AuthorID": "56401167800", "AffiliationID": "60006490", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Disease Research Program, Center for Bone Marrow Transplantation, Dept. of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital M\u00fcnster"}, "7004027622": {"Name": "Fr\u00f6hlich B.", "AuthorID": "7004027622", "AffiliationID": "60006490", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Disease Research Program, Center for Bone Marrow Transplantation, Dept. of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital M\u00fcnster"}, "57218154105": {"Name": "Groll A.H.", "AuthorID": "57218154105", "AffiliationID": "60006490", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Disease Research Program, Center for Bone Marrow Transplantation, Dept. of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital M\u00fcnster"}, "56491003200": {"Name": "Vasileiou E.", "AuthorID": "56491003200", "AffiliationID": "60015331, 60026834", "AffiliationName": "Hematology Oncology Unit, 2nd Department of Pediatrics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, AHEPA Hospital"}, "57193720042": {"Name": "Gastine S.", "AuthorID": "57193720042", "AffiliationID": "60000401", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Medical Chemistry, University of M\u00fcnster"}, "56391501000": {"Name": "M\u00fcller C.", "AuthorID": "56391501000", "AffiliationID": "60024025", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Cologne"}}}
