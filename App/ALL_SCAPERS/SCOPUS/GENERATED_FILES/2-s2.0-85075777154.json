Blood Cancer", "Volume": "67", "Issue": 2, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": null, "PageEnd": null, "CitedBy": 1, "DOI": "10.1002/pbc.28039", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85075777154&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Background: As a significant proportion of relapses occurred in the tumor bed or abdomen on patients with the fifth National Wilms Tumor Study stage I anaplastic Wilms tumor (WT), flank radiotherapy was added for stage I anaplastic WT in the subsequent study of the Children's Oncology Group (AREN0321). Preliminary results revealed reduction of relapse rate and improved survival. In cases treated with preoperative chemotherapy, such as in International Society of Pediatric Oncology (SIOP), the value of radiotherapy has never been studied. The aim of this observational study is to describe the pattern of recurrence and survival of patients with stage I diffuse anaplastic WT (DAWT) after induction chemotherapy. Methods: Retrospective data analysis of the pattern of relapse and survival of all patients with stage I DAWT were included in recent SIOP, L'Associazone Italiana Ematologica Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP), Japan Wilms Tumor Study Group (JWiTS), United Kingdom Children's Cancer Study Group (UKCCSG) renal tumor registries. Postoperative treatment consisted of actinomycin D, vincristine, and doxorubicin for 28 weeks without local irradiation. Results: One hundred nine cases with stage I DAWT were identified, of which 95 cases received preoperative chemotherapy. Of these, seven patients underwent preoperative true-cut biopsy. Sixteen of the 95 patients relapsed (17%), six locally, four at distant site, and six combined, and all treated according to SIOP 2001 relapse protocol, which resulted in a 5-year overall survival of 93%. Conclusion: Despite 13% locoregional relapse rate, an excellent rescue rate was achieved after salvage treatment, in patients with stage I DAWT whose first-line treatment comprised three-drug chemotherapy (including doxorubicin), without flank irradiation. Therefore, we continue not to advocate the use of radiotherapy in first-line treatment after preoperative chemotherapy in stage I DAWT in the next SIOP protocol.", "AuthorKeywords": ["diffuse anaplasia", "radiotherapy", "stage I", "Wilms tumor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Child, Preschool", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Combined Modality Therapy", "Dactinomycin", "Doxorubicin", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Infant", "Kidney Neoplasms", "Male", "Prognosis", "Prospective Studies", "Radiotherapy", "Retrospective Studies", "Survival Rate", "Vincristine", "Wilms Tumor"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075777154", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"56646152800": {"Name": "Fajardo R.D.", "AuthorID": "56646152800", "AffiliationID": "114544822", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Oncology, Princess M\u00e1xima Center for Pediatric Oncology"}, "16480496300": {"Name": "Janssens G.O.", "AuthorID": "16480496300", "AffiliationID": "114544822", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Oncology, Princess M\u00e1xima Center for Pediatric Oncology"}, "6602159710": {"Name": "van den Heuvel-Eibrink M.M.", "AuthorID": "6602159710", "AffiliationID": "114544822", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Oncology, Princess M\u00e1xima Center for Pediatric Oncology"}, "7003987064": {"Name": "de Krijger R.R.", "AuthorID": "7003987064", "AffiliationID": "114544822", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Oncology, Princess M\u00e1xima Center for Pediatric Oncology"}, "7801560923": {"Name": "van Grotel M.", "AuthorID": "7801560923", "AffiliationID": "114544822", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Oncology, Princess M\u00e1xima Center for Pediatric Oncology"}, "7005001567": {"Name": "Spreafico F.", "AuthorID": "7005001567", "AffiliationID": "60006583", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Oncology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori"}, "56266131400": {"Name": "van Tinteren H.", "AuthorID": "56266131400", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, The Netherlands Cancer Institute"}, "6506533418": {"Name": "Acha T.", "AuthorID": "6506533418", "AffiliationID": "60004717", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hospital Materno-Infantil"}, "7102206707": {"Name": "Bergeron C.", "AuthorID": "7102206707", "AffiliationID": "60018084", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Oncology, Centre Leon Berard"}, "7004176152": {"Name": "de Camargo B.", "AuthorID": "7004176152", "AffiliationID": "60014878", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Instituto Nacional Do Cancer (INCA)"}, "16679786700": {"Name": "Oldenburger F.", "AuthorID": "16679786700", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Academic Medical Center"}, "35468349200": {"Name": "R\u00fcbe C.", "AuthorID": "35468349200", "AffiliationID": "60023686", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radio-Oncology, University Hospital of Saarland"}, "57216598591": {"Name": "Oue T.", "AuthorID": "57216598591", "AffiliationID": "60030873", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Surgery, Hyogo College of Medicine"}, "16235306100": {"Name": "Vokuhl C.", "AuthorID": "16235306100", "AffiliationID": "60012345", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pediatric Pathology, University of Kiel"}, "7005591155": {"Name": "Vujanic G.", "AuthorID": "7005591155", "AffiliationID": "60107609", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Sidra Medicine"}, "57049165000": {"Name": "Sebire N.", "AuthorID": "57049165000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "6602254537": {"Name": "Coulomb-L'Hermine A.", "AuthorID": "6602254537", "AffiliationID": "112736138", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Hopitaux Universitaires Est Parisien"}, "7003816255": {"Name": "Collini P.", "AuthorID": "7003816255", "AffiliationID": "60006583", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori"}, "7004063947": {"Name": "Gandola L.", "AuthorID": "7004063947", "AffiliationID": "60006583", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori"}, "7005535741": {"Name": "Pritchard-Jones K.", "AuthorID": "7005535741", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "34975072100": {"Name": "Graf N.", "AuthorID": "34975072100", "AffiliationID": "60023686", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Oncology, University Hospital of Saarland"}}}
