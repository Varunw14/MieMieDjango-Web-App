Here, we report the effects of bilateral GPiam-DBS on cognitive function in 11 of the 13 patients who had participated in our double-blind cross-over trial of GPi-DBS. Methods: Patients were assessed at baseline (4 weeks prior to surgery) and at the end of each of the three-month blinded periods, with stimulation either ON or OFF. The patients were evaluated on tests of memory (California Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT-II); Corsi blocks; Short Recognition Memory for Faces), executive function (D-KEFS Stroop color-word interference, verbal fluency, Trail-making test, Hayling Sentence Completion test), and attention (Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test, Numbers and Letters Test). Results: GPiam-DBS did not produce any significant change in global cognition. Relative to pre-operative baseline assessment verbal episodic memory on the CVLT-II and set-shifting on the Trail-making Test were improved with DBS OFF. Performance on the cognitive tests were not different with DBS ON versus DBS OFF. GPiam-DBS did not alter aspects of cognition that are impaired in TS such as inhibition on the Stroop interference task or the Hayling Sentence Completion test. Conclusions: This study extends previous findings providing data showing that GPiam-DBS does not adversely affect cognitive domains such as memory, executive function, verbal fluency, attention, psychomotor speed, and information processing. These results indicate that GPiam-DBS does not produce any cognitive deficits in TS.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cognitive function", "Deep brain stimulation", "Globus pallidus", "Tourette syndrome"],
