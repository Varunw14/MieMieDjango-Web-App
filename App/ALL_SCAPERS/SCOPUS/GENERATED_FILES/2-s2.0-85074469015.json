Laminaria digitata, Ulva lactuca and for the first time Dilsea carnosa were used as representatives of brown, green and red species of seaweed, respectively. Acid thermo-chemical and entirely aqueous (water) based pre-treatments were evaluated, using a range of sulphuric acid concentrations (0.125\u20132.5 M) and solids loading contents (5\u201325 % [w/v]; biomass: reactant) and different reaction times (5\u201330 min), with the aim of maximising the release of glucose following enzyme hydrolysis. A pre-treatment step for each of the three seaweeds was required and pre-treatment conditions were found to be specific to each seaweed species. Dilsea carnosa and U. lactuca were more suited with an aqueous (water-based) pre-treatment (yielding 125.0 and 360.0 mg of glucose/g of pre-treated seaweed, respectively), yet interestingly non pre-treated D. carnosa yielded 106.4 g g\u22121 glucose. Laminaria digitata required a dilute acid thermo-chemical pre-treatment in order to liberate maximal glucose yields (218.9 mg glucose/g pre-treated seaweed). Fermentations with S. cerevisiae NCYC2592 of the generated hydrolysates gave ethanol yields of 5.4 g L\u22121, 7.8 g L\u22121 and 3.2 g L\u22121 from D. carnosa, U. lactuca and L. digitata, respectively. This study highlighted that entirely aqueous based pre-treatments are effective for seaweed biomass, yet bioethanol production alone may not make such bio-processes economically viable at large scale.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bioethanol", "D. carnosa", "L. digitata", "Macroalgae", "Pre-treatment", "U. lactuca"], "IndexKeywords": ["D. carnosa", "L. digitata", "Macro-algae", "Pre-Treatment", "U. lactuca"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074469015", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Agronomy and Crop Science", "AGRI", "1102"], ["Energy (miscellaneous)", "ENER", "2101"]], "AuthorData": {"56667636500": {"Name": "Kostas E.T.", "AuthorID": "56667636500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, The Advanced Centre of Biochemical Engineering, Bernard Katz Building, University College London"}, "57209549484": {"Name": "Cook D.J.", "AuthorID": "57209549484", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Brewing Science, Division of Food Science, The University of Nottingham"}, "55376064600": {"Name": "White D.A.", "AuthorID": "55376064600", "AffiliationID": "60010503", "AffiliationName": "Plymouth Marine Laboratory, Prospect Pl"}}}
