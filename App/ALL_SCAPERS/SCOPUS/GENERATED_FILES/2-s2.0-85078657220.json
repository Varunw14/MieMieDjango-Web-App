Notably, running the reaction in this manner renders it effective irrespective of the initial morphology of the zinc metal. The process is operationally simple, does not require inert atmospheres or dry solvents, and is reported over a range of aldehyde and ketone substrates; a gram-scale process is demonstrated.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Allylation reactions", "Barbier type", "Gram scale", "Inert atmospheres", "Initial morphology", "Mechanochemicals", "Milling conditions", "Zinc metal"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078657220", "SubjectAreas": [["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"55362788300": {"Name": "Yin J.X.", "AuthorID": "55362788300", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff University, Main Building"}, "57209260955": {"Name": "Stark R.T.", "AuthorID": "57209260955", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff University, Main Building"}, "6603434983": {"Name": "Fallis I.A.", "AuthorID": "6603434983", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff University, Main Building"}, "23018311500": {"Name": "Browne D.L.", "AuthorID": "23018311500", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff University, Main Building"}}}
