It requires that its members live in accordance with Halakha (Jewish law), the dominant protocol determining Jewish ritual and translation of the commandments into many aspects of day-to-day living. The strict orthodox Jewish (Haredi) community comprises many sects whose communal identity plays a central role in everyday life and spatial organisation. This book examines how different levels of communal organisation are reflected in the residential patterns of four British communities: The Litvish communities of Golders Green and Gateshead, and the Hassidic community of Stamford Hill and Canvey Island. The research reveals and analyses powerful mechanisms of residential segregation acting at the level of the apartment, building and the near neighbourhood level. Identifying the main engines of spontaneous and organised neighbourhood change and evaluating the difficulties of liberal planning dealing with non-autonomous individuals in the housing market shed light on similar processes occurring in other city centres with diverse population groups. This book aims to highlight the impact of various organisational levels on the spatial structure of the urban enclave. It focuses on the internal dynamics of ethno-religious enclaves that emerge from three levels of action: (1) individuals\u2019 relationships with their own and other groups; (2) the community leadership\u2019s powers inside the group and in respect of other groups; and (3) government directives and tools (e.g. planning). The study investigates the residential dynamics of four Haredi areas in the UK, representing differing social organisational through communal leadership and local-government directives.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Borders", "British haredi jewry", "Delineation", "Enclave", "Liberal planning", "Orthodox judaism", "Residential behaviour"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073145006", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"55536712300": {"Name": "Flint Ashery S.", "AuthorID": "55536712300", "AffiliationID": "60002765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography and Environment, Bar Ilan University"}}}
