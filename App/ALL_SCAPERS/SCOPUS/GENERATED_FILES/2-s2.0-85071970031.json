However, one of the main differences between these trials is the microdystrophin protein produced following treatment. Each gene transfer product is based on different selections of dystrophin domain combinations to assemble microdystrophin transgenes that maintain functional dystrophin domains and fit within the packaging limits of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector. While domains involved in mechanical function, such as the actin-binding domain and \u03b2-dystroglycan binding domain, have been identified for many years and included in microdystrophin constructs, more recently the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) domain has also been identified due to its role in enhancing nNOS membrane localization. As nNOS membrane localization has been established as an important requirement for prevention of functional ischemia in skeletal muscle, inclusion of the nNOS domain into a microdystrophin construct represents an important consideration. The aim of this mini review is to highlight what is currently known about the nNOS domain of dystrophin and to describe potential implications of this domain in a microdystrophin gene transfer clinical trial.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Dystrophin", "Genetic Therapy", "Humans", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne", "Nitric Oxide Synthase Type I", "Sarcolemma"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071970031", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"56992915800": {"Name": "Boehler J.F.", "AuthorID": "56992915800", "AffiliationID": "120012520", "AffiliationName": "Solid Biosciences"}, "22952103100": {"Name": "Ricotti V.", "AuthorID": "22952103100", "AffiliationID": "120012520", "AffiliationName": "Solid Biosciences"}, "55520063100": {"Name": "Gonzalez J.P.", "AuthorID": "55520063100", "AffiliationID": "120012520", "AffiliationName": "Solid Biosciences"}, "57210947858": {"Name": "Soustek-Kramer M.", "AuthorID": "57210947858", "AffiliationID": "120012520", "AffiliationName": "Solid Biosciences"}, "57210945513": {"Name": "Such L.", "AuthorID": "57210945513", "AffiliationID": "120012520", "AffiliationName": "Solid Biosciences"}, "7404382318": {"Name": "Brown K.J.", "AuthorID": "7404382318", "AffiliationID": "120012520", "AffiliationName": "Solid Biosciences"}, "35369424900": {"Name": "Schneider J.S.", "AuthorID": "35369424900", "AffiliationID": "120012520", "AffiliationName": "Solid Biosciences"}, "7401472559": {"Name": "Morris C.A.", "AuthorID": "7401472559", "AffiliationID": "120012520", "AffiliationName": "Solid Biosciences"}}}
