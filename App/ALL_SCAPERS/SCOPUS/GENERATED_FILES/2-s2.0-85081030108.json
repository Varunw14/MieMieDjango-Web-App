One key mechanism for trainee teacher development is written lesson observation feedback, but there is a concern that it is often generic in nature. In response to this, our research explores the ways in which geography teacher educators' curricular theorising is rendered visible through written lesson observation feedback. This paper reports on the interplay between teacher, student and content apparent within lesson observation feedback and the ways that geography teachers incorporate a focus upon a subject within their mentoring practices. The project, an interpretive case study, collected data through a lesson observation activity and whole-group discussion. Results suggest that the interplay between teacher, student and content within written lesson observation feedback often draws on subject-specific pedagogical approaches and stimulates mentor/trainee dialogue that has the potential to provoke wider curricular thinking around the \u2018what and why\u2019 of teaching. However, further research is needed to gain a contextualised understanding of mentoring practices, including the exploration of the role of mentors' own subject expertise, given the significance of this in guiding their professional practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["curricular theorising", "initial teacher education", "lesson observation feedback", "mentoring", "school geography", "subject knowledge"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081030108", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"57211403520": {"Name": "Healy G.", "AuthorID": "57211403520", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "55892907700": {"Name": "Walshe N.", "AuthorID": "55892907700", "AffiliationID": "60000913", "AffiliationName": "Anglia Ruskin University"}, "37087190500": {"Name": "Dunphy A.", "AuthorID": "37087190500", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge"}}}
