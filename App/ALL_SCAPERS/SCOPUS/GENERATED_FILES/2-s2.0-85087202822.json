To provide a declarative semantics for sensing and belief conditioned actions in a probabilistic, narrative setting we introduce the novel concept of an epistemic reduct. We then formally compare our language with two established frameworks for probabilistic reasoning about action \u2013 the action language PAL by Baral et al., and the extension of the situation calculus to reason about noisy sensors and effectors by Bacchus et al. In both cases we prove a correspondence with EPEC for a class of domains representable in both frameworks.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Conditional actions", "Epistemic reasoning", "Imperfect sensing", "Narrative reasoning", "Probabilistic reasoning", "Reasoning about actions"], "IndexKeywords": ["Action language", "Declarative semantics", "Epistemic actions", "Epistemic reasonings", "Event calculus", "Noisy sensors", "Probabilistic reasoning", "Situation calculus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087202822", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"55903529100": {"Name": "D'Asaro F.A.", "AuthorID": "55903529100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information Studies, University College London"}, "11641015900": {"Name": "Bikakis A.", "AuthorID": "11641015900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information Studies, University College London"}, "23088594700": {"Name": "Dickens L.", "AuthorID": "23088594700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information Studies, University College London"}, "55547118378": {"Name": "Miller R.", "AuthorID": "55547118378", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information Studies, University College London"}}}
