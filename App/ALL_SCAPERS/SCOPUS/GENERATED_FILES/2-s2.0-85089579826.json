American Journal of Medical Genetics Part C: Seminars in Medical Genetics published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.Variants in the PROM1 gene are associated with cone (\u2212rod) dystrophy, macular dystrophy, and other phenotypes. We describe the clinical and genetic characteristics of 10 patients from eight Japanese families with PROM1-associated retinal disorder (PROM1-RD) in a nationwide cohort. A literature review of PROM1-RD in the Japanese population was also performed. The median age at onset/examination of 10 patients was 31.0 (range, 10\u201345)/44.5 (22\u201373) years. All 10 patients showed atrophic macular changes. Seven patients (70.0%) had spared fovea to various degrees, approximately half of whom had maintained visual acuity. Generalized cone (\u2212rod) dysfunction was demonstrated in all nine subjects with available electrophysiological data. Three PROM1 variants were identified in this study: one recurrent disease-causing variant (p.Arg373Cys), one novel putative disease-causing variant (p.Cys112Arg), and one novel variant of uncertain significance (VUS; p.Gly53Asp). Characteristic features of macular atrophy with generalized cone-dominated retinal dysfunction were shared among all 10 subjects with PROM1-RD, and the presence of foveal sparing was crucial in maintaining visual acuity. Together with the three previously reported variants [p.R373C, c.1551+1G'A (pathogenic), p.Asn580His (likely benign)] in the literature of Japanese patients, one prevalent missense variant (p.Arg373Cys, 6/9 families, 66.7%) detected in multiple studies was determined in the Japanese population, which was also frequently detected in the European population.", "AuthorKeywords": ["autosomal dominant", "cone dystrophy", "cone rod dystrophy", "macular dystrophy", "PROM1"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089579826", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"23027590900": {"Name": "Fujinami K.", "AuthorID": "23027590900", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "56479586400": {"Name": "Yang L.", "AuthorID": "56479586400", "AffiliationID": "60025252", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Keio University School of Medicine"}, "6508145987": {"Name": "Arno G.", "AuthorID": "6508145987", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "North East Thames Regional Genetics Service, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, Great Ormond Street NHS Foundation Trust"}, "37665820900": {"Name": "Pontikos N.", "AuthorID": "37665820900", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "57208741378": {"Name": "Fujinami-Yokokawa Y.", "AuthorID": "57208741378", "AffiliationID": "124168100", "AffiliationName": "Division of Public Health, Yokokawa Clinic"}, "57210986143": {"Name": "Liu X.", "AuthorID": "57210986143", "AffiliationID": "60023797, 60073512", "AffiliationName": "Southwest Hospital/Southwest Eye Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University)"}, "55825423000": {"Name": "Nakamura N.", "AuthorID": "55825423000", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, The University of Tokyo"}, "7401892528": {"Name": "Miyake Y.", "AuthorID": "7401892528", "AffiliationID": "123451374", "AffiliationName": "Next vision, Kobe Eye Center"}, "7101962991": {"Name": "Tsunoda K.", "AuthorID": "7101962991", "AffiliationID": "60032544", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Visual Physiology, Division of Vision Research, National Institute of Sensory Organs, National Hospital Organization Tokyo Medical Center"}, "8591174900": {"Name": "Kurihara T.", "AuthorID": "8591174900", "AffiliationID": "60025252", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Keio University School of Medicine"}, "36044308900": {"Name": "Tsubota K.", "AuthorID": "36044308900", "AffiliationID": "60025252", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Keio University School of Medicine"}, "7005277994": {"Name": "Oishi A.", "AuthorID": "7005277994", "AffiliationID": "60119317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine"}, "7003458378": {"Name": "Tsujikawa A.", "AuthorID": "7003458378", "AffiliationID": "60119317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine"}, "55940412100": {"Name": "Yoshitake K.", "AuthorID": "55940412100", "AffiliationID": "60032544", "AffiliationName": "Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology, National Institute of Sensory Organs, National Hospital Organization Tokyo Medical Center"}, "35477839800": {"Name": "Iwata T.", "AuthorID": "35477839800", "AffiliationID": "60032544", "AffiliationName": "Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology, National Institute of Sensory Organs, National Hospital Organization Tokyo Medical Center"}, "35447289900": {"Name": "Hayashi T.", "AuthorID": "35447289900", "AffiliationID": "60031615", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, The Jikei University School of Medicine"}, "55785794700": {"Name": "Katagiri S.", "AuthorID": "55785794700", "AffiliationID": "60031615", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, The Jikei University School of Medicine"}, "57195608563": {"Name": "Mizobuchi K.", "AuthorID": "57195608563", "AffiliationID": "60031615", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, The Jikei University School of Medicine"}, "56922502900": {"Name": "Mizota A.", "AuthorID": "56922502900", "AffiliationID": "60027553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Teikyo University"}, "7102950386": {"Name": "Shinoda K.", "AuthorID": "7102950386", "AffiliationID": "60020563", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Saitama Medical University"}}}
