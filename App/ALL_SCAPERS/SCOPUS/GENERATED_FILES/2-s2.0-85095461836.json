All rights reserved.Objective. Scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) is a life-threatening complication of systemic sclerosis (SSc) strongly associated with anti-RNA polymerase III antibody (ARA) autoantibodies. We investigated genetic susceptibility and altered protein expression in renal biopsy specimens in ARA-positive patients with SRC. Methods. ARA-positive patients (n = 99) with at least 5 years' follow-up (49% with a history of SRC) were selected from a well characterized SSc cohort (n = 2254). Cases were genotyped using the Illumina Human Omni-express chip. Based on initial regression analysis, 9 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were chosen for validation in a separate cohort of 256 ARA-positive patients (40 with SRC). Immunostaining of tissue sections from SRC or control kidney was used to quantify expression of candidate proteins based upon genetic analysis of the discovery cohort. Results. Analysis of 641,489 SNP suggested association of POU2F1 (rs2093658; P= 1.98 \u00d7 10-5), CTNND2 (rs1859082; P = 5.58 \u00d7 10-5), HECW2 (rs16849716; P = 1.2 \u00d7 10-4), and GPATCH2L (rs935332; P = 4.92 \u00d7 10-5) with SRC. Further, the validation cohort showed an association between rs935332 within the GPATCH2L region, with SRC (P = 0.025). Immunostaining of renal biopsy sections showed increased tubular expression of GPATCH2L (P = 0.026) and glomerular expression of CTNND2 (P = 0.026) in SRC samples (n = 8) compared with normal human kidney controls (n = 8), despite absence of any genetic replication for the associated SNP. Conclusion. Increased expression of 2 candidate proteins, GPATCH2L and CTNND2, in SRC compared with control kidney suggests a potential role in pathogenesis of SRC. For GPATCH2L, this may reflect genetic susceptibility in ARA-positive patients with SSc based upon 2 independent cohorts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autoantibody", "Catenin", "Genetics", "Hypertension", "Renal", "Scleroderma"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095461836", "SubjectAreas": [["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"56651766600": {"Name": "Stern E.P.", "AuthorID": "56651766600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL), Centre for Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases, UCL Centre for Nephrology"}, "36924819700": {"Name": "Guerra S.G.", "AuthorID": "36924819700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases"}, "57219782682": {"Name": "Chinque H.", "AuthorID": "57219782682", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases"}, "57203181840": {"Name": "Acquaah V.", "AuthorID": "57203181840", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases"}, "6602769002": {"Name": "Ponticos M.", "AuthorID": "6602769002", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases"}, "8398311200": {"Name": "Ong V.H.", "AuthorID": "8398311200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases"}, "15746876300": {"Name": "Khan K.", "AuthorID": "15746876300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases"}, "16024754700": {"Name": "Nihtyanova S.I.", "AuthorID": "16024754700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases"}, "57209690122": {"Name": "Fonseca C.", "AuthorID": "57209690122", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases"}, "7006031021": {"Name": "Denton C.P.", "AuthorID": "7006031021", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases"}, "57202348203": {"Name": "Gonz\u00e1lez-Serna D.", "AuthorID": "57202348203", "AffiliationID": "60000294, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Parasitologia y Biomedicina Lopez-Neyra, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas (CSIC)"}, "57212788531": {"Name": "Martin J.", "AuthorID": "57212788531", "AffiliationID": "60000294, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Parasitologia y Biomedicina Lopez-Neyra, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas (CSIC)"}, "6603918658": {"Name": "Harber M.", "AuthorID": "6603918658", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nephrology"}, "35472946900": {"Name": "Burns A.", "AuthorID": "35472946900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nephrology"}, "57209692635": {"Name": "Mayes M.D.", "AuthorID": "57209692635", "AffiliationID": "60027512, 60021568", "AffiliationName": "University of Texas Houston, McGovern Medical School"}, "8907543700": {"Name": "Assassi S.", "AuthorID": "8907543700", "AffiliationID": "60027512, 60021568", "AffiliationName": "University of Texas Houston, McGovern Medical School"}}}
