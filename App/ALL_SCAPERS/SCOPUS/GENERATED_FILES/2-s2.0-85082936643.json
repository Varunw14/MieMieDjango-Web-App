PADO (Programa de Alta Dedicaci\u00f3n Operativa) is a large-scale hot spot policing program implemented by the Uruguay Police in April 2016 in the city of Montevideo. Using an evaluation technique that compares the differential effect between areas where PADO was deployed and control areas, a 23 percent reduction in the rate at which robberies occurred was experienced in the PADO areas, with no significant displacement to neighboring areas, or other areas of the city during the study period. The study indicates that hot spot policing programs can be effective in reducing crime in Latin American urban environments and illustrates how targeted police interventions can be robustly evaluated when control areas are not established at the outset of an intervention.", "AuthorKeywords": ["difference-in-difference", "Hot spot policing", "Latin America", "Montevideo", "robbery"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082936643", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"37100990500": {"Name": "Chainey S.P.", "AuthorID": "37100990500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}, "57216256849": {"Name": "Serrano\u2013Berthet R.", "AuthorID": "57216256849", "AffiliationID": "60007869", "AffiliationName": "Citizen Security Cluster, Innovation for Citizen Services Division, Inter-American Development Bank"}, "57057656700": {"Name": "Veneri F.", "AuthorID": "57057656700", "AffiliationID": "60004354", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, Iowa State University"}}}
