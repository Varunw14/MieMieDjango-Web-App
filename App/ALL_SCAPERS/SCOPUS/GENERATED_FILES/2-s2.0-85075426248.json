An online questionnaire was co-produced and responses subjected to quantitative and thematic analysis. 941 survey responses were received (641 from lay community). People with CF reported a median of 10 (interquartile range: 6\u201315) current treatments. Seven main themes relating to simplifying treatment burden were identified. Treatment burden is high, extending beyond time taken to perform routine daily treatments, with impact varying according to person-specific factors. Approaches to communication, support, evaluation of current treatments, service set-up, and treatment logistics (obtaining/administration) contribute to burden, offering scope for evaluation in clinical trials or service improvement.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clinical trial", "Co-production", "Cystic fibrosis", "Priority setting", "Treatment burden"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075426248", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"57210242034": {"Name": "Davies G.", "AuthorID": "57210242034", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory, Critical Care and Anaesthesia Section, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "16070579700": {"Name": "Rowbotham N.J.", "AuthorID": "16070579700", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Evidence Based Child Health Group, University of Nottingham"}, "57199389435": {"Name": "Smith S.", "AuthorID": "57199389435", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Evidence Based Child Health Group, University of Nottingham"}, "57211942493": {"Name": "Herbert S.", "AuthorID": "57211942493", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Evidence Based Child Health Group, University of Nottingham"}, "7103344712": {"Name": "Smyth A.R.", "AuthorID": "7103344712", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Evidence Based Child Health Group, University of Nottingham"}, "57211939982": {"Name": "Elliot Z.C.", "AuthorID": "57211939982", "AffiliationID": "120499245", "AffiliationName": "Parent of Children with CF"}, "57204026374": {"Name": "Gathercole K.", "AuthorID": "57204026374", "AffiliationID": "123494164", "AffiliationName": "Person with CF"}, "56503984800": {"Name": "Rayner O.", "AuthorID": "56503984800", "AffiliationID": "123016070", "AffiliationName": "Person with CF, Plymouth"}, "16239254000": {"Name": "Leighton P.A.", "AuthorID": "16239254000", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Evidence Based Dermatology, University of Nottingham"}, "7006197123": {"Name": "Duff A.J.", "AuthorID": "7006197123", "AffiliationID": "60012508", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "57204025534": {"Name": "Chandran S.", "AuthorID": "57204025534", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric CF Service, Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57211943919": {"Name": "Daniels T.", "AuthorID": "57211943919", "AffiliationID": "60170537", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiotherapy, York Hull Adult CF Unit, York Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, York"}, "24344781000": {"Name": "Nash E.F.", "AuthorID": "24344781000", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "West Midlands Adult CF Centre, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
