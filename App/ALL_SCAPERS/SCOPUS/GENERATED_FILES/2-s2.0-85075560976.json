This work for the first time rationalizes a biocomposite composed of PGS and \u03b2-TCP prepared by a fast and well-controlled microwave approach. As expected, the presence of \u03b2-TCP particles (i) improves the degree of cross-linking of PGS, thus decreasing the sol content by ca. 66%, (ii) enhances its hydrophilicity with much lower contact angle, (iii) reduces the degradation rate by a factor of two and (iv) increases the swelling effect of the biocomposite by ca. 10%. Furthermore both PGS/\u03b2-TCP150 and PGS/\u03b2-TCP180 biocomposites demonstrate significant difference in cell viability form the single PGS materials, which is more than 65% higher in cell growth in one day proliferation, demonstrating an advanced biomaterial embodying both advantages of PGS polymer and \u03b2-TCP bioceramics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cell proliferation", "Composite", "Degradation rate", "Degree of cross-linking", "Hydrophilicity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075560976", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"57007645400": {"Name": "Lau C.C.", "AuthorID": "57007645400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "30067558300": {"Name": "Bayazit M.K.", "AuthorID": "30067558300", "AffiliationID": "60008991", "AffiliationName": "SUNUM Nanotechnology Research and Application Centre, Sabanci University"}, "57194506415": {"Name": "Xie J.", "AuthorID": "57194506415", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7404638641": {"Name": "Tang J.", "AuthorID": "7404638641", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56866331500": {"Name": "Al Qaysi M.", "AuthorID": "56866331500", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "57195976712": {"Name": "Owji N.", "AuthorID": "57195976712", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "26643634100": {"Name": "Knowles J.C.", "AuthorID": "26643634100", "AffiliationID": "60002877", "AffiliationName": "UCL Eastman-Korea Dental Medicine Innovation Centre, Dankook University"}}}
