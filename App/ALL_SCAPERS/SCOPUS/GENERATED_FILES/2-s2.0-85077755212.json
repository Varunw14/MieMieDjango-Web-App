An impaired ability to repeat nonsense words (\u201cnonword repetition\u201d), is claimed to be a robust behavioural marker for these conditions. Yet how brain function is altered during this task remains poorly understood. Previous research suggests that DLD or DSD may be associated with reduced brain activation in the inferior frontal and posterior temporal regions when compared to controls. However, this research is limited by within and between group variability in age, speech/language phenotype, and comorbidities. Here, we used functional MRI to examine brain activation during nonword repetition. As anticipated, behavioural findings confirmed that the DLD and DSD groups had poorer nonword repetition performance compared to typical controls. In contrast, fMRI revealed no statistically significant differences in brain activation, despite the groups appearing to engage slightly different regions when compared at identical thresholds. Therefore, whilst nonword repetition is a sensitive clinical marker for DLD and DSD, the findings from this study suggest that this task is not a sensitive brain MRI marker for children with these disorders, unlike for individuals with single gene mutations like FOXP2 mutations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Development", "fMRI", "Language", "Nonword repetition", "Speech"], "IndexKeywords": ["Auditory Perception", "Brain Mapping", "Child", "Female", "Humans", "Language Development Disorders", "Longitudinal Studies", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Speech", "Speech Disorders", "Speech Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077755212", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"55606530100": {"Name": "Pigdon L.", "AuthorID": "55606530100", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Turner Institute for Brain and Mental Health, Monash University"}, "57200939394": {"Name": "Reilly S.", "AuthorID": "57200939394", "AffiliationID": "60032987, 60189943", "AffiliationName": "Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University"}, "7003644785": {"Name": "Conti-Ramsden G.", "AuthorID": "7003644785", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "The University of Manchester"}, "7403139870": {"Name": "Morgan A.T.", "AuthorID": "7403139870", "AffiliationID": "60026489", "AffiliationName": "Royal Children's Hospital"}, "7005284247": {"Name": "Willmott C.", "AuthorID": "7005284247", "AffiliationID": "60012932", "AffiliationName": "Monash-Epworth Rehabilitation Research Centre"}, "7007072426": {"Name": "Connelly A.", "AuthorID": "7007072426", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "University of Melbourne"}, "7003352056": {"Name": "Liegeois F.", "AuthorID": "7003352056", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}}}
