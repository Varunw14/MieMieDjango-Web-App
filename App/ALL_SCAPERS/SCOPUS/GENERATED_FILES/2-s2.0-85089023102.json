Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of American Neurological AssociationThe CMT Pediatric Scale (CMTPedS) is a reliable, valid, and responsive clinical outcome measure of disability in children with CMT. The aim of this study was to identify the most responsive patient subset(s), based on the standardized response mean (SRM), to optimize the CMTPedS as a primary outcome measure for upcoming clinical trials. Analysis was based on a 2-year natural history data from 187 children aged 3\u201320 years with a range of CMT genetic subtypes. Subsets based on age (3\u20138 years), disability level (CMTPedS score 0\u201314), and CMT type (CMT1A) increased the SRM of the CMTPedS considerably. Refining the inclusion criteria in clinical trials to younger, mildly affected cases of CMT1A optimizes the responsiveness of the CMTPedS.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089023102", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56575596000": {"Name": "Cornett K.M.D.", "AuthorID": "56575596000", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60026571", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Sciences, University of Sydney, The Children\u2019s Hospital at Westmead"}, "35897587300": {"Name": "Bray P.", "AuthorID": "35897587300", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60026571", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Sciences, University of Sydney, The Children\u2019s Hospital at Westmead"}, "8875498900": {"Name": "Burns J.", "AuthorID": "8875498900", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60026571", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Sciences, University of Sydney, The Children\u2019s Hospital at Westmead"}, "55177715500": {"Name": "Menezes M.P.", "AuthorID": "55177715500", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60026571", "AffiliationName": "Paediatrics and Child Health, University of Sydney, The Children\u2019s Hospital at Westmead"}, "8768932300": {"Name": "Shy R.R.", "AuthorID": "8768932300", "AffiliationID": "60009788, 60024324", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa"}, "6602137148": {"Name": "Moroni I.", "AuthorID": "6602137148", "AffiliationID": "60017275", "AffiliationName": "Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico Carlo Besta"}, "6602893492": {"Name": "Pagliano E.", "AuthorID": "6602893492", "AffiliationID": "60017275", "AffiliationName": "Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico Carlo Besta"}, "7004613502": {"Name": "Pareyson D.", "AuthorID": "7004613502", "AffiliationID": "60017275", "AffiliationName": "Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico Carlo Besta"}, "55077472100": {"Name": "Estilow T.", "AuthorID": "55077472100", "AffiliationID": "60030118", "AffiliationName": "Department of Occupational Therapy, The Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia"}, "34980195500": {"Name": "Yum S.W.", "AuthorID": "34980195500", "AffiliationID": "60003711, 60030118, 60006297", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurology, Perelman School of Medicine, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania"}, "57189693887": {"Name": "Bhandari T.", "AuthorID": "57189693887", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60172638, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health and National Institute for Health Research Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre"}, "7102038246": {"Name": "Muntoni F.", "AuthorID": "7102038246", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "22951097700": {"Name": "Laura M.", "AuthorID": "22951097700", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57203175311": {"Name": "Reilly M.M.", "AuthorID": "57203175311", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7006041140": {"Name": "Finkel R.S.", "AuthorID": "7006041140", "AffiliationID": "60019905", "AffiliationName": "Translational Neurosciences (Pediatrics), St. Jude Children's Research Hospital"}, "37033676900": {"Name": "Eichinger K.J.", "AuthorID": "37033676900", "AffiliationID": "60027165", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Rochester"}, "7103151892": {"Name": "Herrmann D.N.", "AuthorID": "7103151892", "AffiliationID": "60027165", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Rochester"}, "57218184398": {"Name": "Shy M.E.", "AuthorID": "57218184398", "AffiliationID": "60009788, 60024324", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa"}}}
