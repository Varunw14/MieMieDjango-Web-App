From memory elements in dot product engines to replicating both synapse and neuron wall behaviors, the memristor has proved a versatile component. Here we demonstrate an analog mode of operation observed in our silicon oxide memristors and apply this to the problem of edge detection. We demonstrate how a potential divider exploiting this analog behavior can prove a scalable solution to edge detection. We confirm its behavior experimentally and simulate its performance on a standard testbench. We show good performance comparable to existing memristor based work with a benchmark score of 0.465 on the BSDS500 dataset, while simultaneously maintaining a lower component count.", "AuthorKeywords": ["computer vision", "edge detection", "memristor", "neuromorphic computing", "spiking neural networks"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078837581", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"57214598620": {"Name": "Mannion D.", "AuthorID": "57214598620", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55236732600": {"Name": "Mehonic A.", "AuthorID": "55236732600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56386662300": {"Name": "Ng W.", "AuthorID": "56386662300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005715736": {"Name": "Kenyon A.", "AuthorID": "7005715736", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
