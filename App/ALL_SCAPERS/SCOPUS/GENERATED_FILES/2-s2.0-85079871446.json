Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy (AC) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous myocardial disease. Half of AC patients harbour private desmosomal gene variants. Although microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as key regulator molecules in cardiovascular diseases and their involvement, correlated to phenotypic variability or to non-invasive biomarkers, has been advanced also in AC, no data are available in larger disease cohorts. Here, we propose the largest AC cohort unbiased by technical and biological factors. MiRNA profiling on nine right ventricular tissue, nine blood samples of AC patients, and four controls highlighted 10 differentially expressed miRNAs in common. Six of these were validated in a 90-AC patient cohort independent from genetic status: miR-122-5p, miR-133a-3p, miR-133b, miR-142-3p, miR-182-5p, and miR-183-5p. This six-miRNA set showed high discriminatory diagnostic power in AC patients when compared to controls (AUC-0.995), non-affected family members of AC probands carrying a desmosomal pathogenic variant (AUC-0.825), and other cardiomyopathy groups (Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: AUC-0.804, Dilated Cardiomyopathy: AUC-0.917, Brugada Syndrome: AUC-0.981, myocarditis: AUC-0.978). AC-related signalling pathways were targeted by this set of miRNAs. A unique set of six-miRNAs was found both in heart-tissue and blood samples of AC probands, supporting its involvement in disease pathogenesis and its possible role as a non-invasive AC diagnostic biomarker.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy 2", "Biomarker 3", "MicroRNA 1"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia", "Biomarkers", "Child", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Humans", "Male", "MicroRNAs", "Middle Aged", "Myocardium", "ROC Curve", "Signal Transduction", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079871446", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"57215089487": {"Name": "Marinas M.B.", "AuthorID": "57215089487", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiac-Thoracic-Vascular Sciences and Public Health, University of Padua, Cardiovascular Pathology, Cardiology and Biostatistics Units"}, "56819026300": {"Name": "Celeghin R.", "AuthorID": "56819026300", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiac-Thoracic-Vascular Sciences and Public Health, University of Padua, Cardiovascular Pathology, Cardiology and Biostatistics Units"}, "56798252000": {"Name": "Cason M.", "AuthorID": "56798252000", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiac-Thoracic-Vascular Sciences and Public Health, University of Padua, Cardiovascular Pathology, Cardiology and Biostatistics Units"}, "57000445300": {"Name": "Bariani R.", "AuthorID": "57000445300", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiac-Thoracic-Vascular Sciences and Public Health, University of Padua, Cardiovascular Pathology, Cardiology and Biostatistics Units"}, "7004070590": {"Name": "Frigo A.C.", "AuthorID": "7004070590", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiac-Thoracic-Vascular Sciences and Public Health, University of Padua, Cardiovascular Pathology, Cardiology and Biostatistics Units"}, "6602669781": {"Name": "Bauce B.", "AuthorID": "6602669781", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiac-Thoracic-Vascular Sciences and Public Health, University of Padua, Cardiovascular Pathology, Cardiology and Biostatistics Units"}, "57204085843": {"Name": "Thiene G.", "AuthorID": "57204085843", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiac-Thoracic-Vascular Sciences and Public Health, University of Padua, Cardiovascular Pathology, Cardiology and Biostatistics Units"}, "7004549983": {"Name": "Corrado D.", "AuthorID": "7004549983", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiac-Thoracic-Vascular Sciences and Public Health, University of Padua, Cardiovascular Pathology, Cardiology and Biostatistics Units"}, "7004539938": {"Name": "Basso C.", "AuthorID": "7004539938", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiac-Thoracic-Vascular Sciences and Public Health, University of Padua, Cardiovascular Pathology, Cardiology and Biostatistics Units"}, "12799284400": {"Name": "Pilichou K.", "AuthorID": "12799284400", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiac-Thoracic-Vascular Sciences and Public Health, University of Padua, Cardiovascular Pathology, Cardiology and Biostatistics Units"}, "57210199660": {"Name": "Jager J.", "AuthorID": "57210199660", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Heart Muscle Disease, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "8892126000": {"Name": "Syrris P.", "AuthorID": "8892126000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Heart Muscle Disease, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "57202356433": {"Name": "Elliott P.M.", "AuthorID": "57202356433", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Heart Muscle Disease, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}}}
