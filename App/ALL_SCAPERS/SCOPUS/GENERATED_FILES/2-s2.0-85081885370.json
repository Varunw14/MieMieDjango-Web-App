Methods: We used the SPring-8 synchrotron radiation facility in Hyogo prefecture in Japan, processing and reconstructing the data with 3-dimensional software. Results: We studied 8 hearts obtained from patients known to have had ventricular septal defects, aged from 6 to 150 days, with a median of 24.5 days. None of the individuals, however, had undergone corrective surgery. The penetrating bundle was found at a median of 1.43 mm from the septal crest, with a range of 0.99 to 1.54 mm. The distance to the nonbranching bundle to the right ventricular endocardium was 1.10 mm, with a range from 0.49 to 2.49 mm, to the origin of the left bundle branch was 2.46 mm, with a range from 1.7 to 3.18 mm, and to the origin of the right bundle branch was 2.34 mm, with a range from 0.50 to 2.59 mm. The median distance from the edge of the caudal limb of the septomarginal trabeculation to the right bundle branch was 1.04 mm, with a range from 0.81 to 1.16 mm. Conclusions: We were able to show the precise location of the axis, with our findings suggesting that longitudinal sutures placed along the posteroinferior rim should be effective in avoiding iatrogenic injury, but sutures should not be placed in the valley between the limbs of the septomarginal trabeculation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["atrioventricular block", "heart conduction axis", "phase contrast computed tomography", "synchrotrons", "ventricular septal defect"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cardiac Surgical Procedures", "Clinical Decision-Making", "Female", "Heart Block", "Heart Conduction System", "Heart Septal Defects, Ventricular", "Humans", "Iatrogenic Disease", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Japan", "Male", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Suture Techniques", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081885370", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57215781884": {"Name": "Yoshitake S.", "AuthorID": "57215781884", "AffiliationID": "60027165", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Cardiac Surgery, University of Rochester, Rochester"}, "7401835476": {"Name": "Kaneko Y.", "AuthorID": "7401835476", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "35475934100": {"Name": "Morita K.", "AuthorID": "35475934100", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "35268774500": {"Name": "Hoshino M.", "AuthorID": "35268774500", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57202771876": {"Name": "Oshima Y.", "AuthorID": "57202771876", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57211783163": {"Name": "Takahashi M.", "AuthorID": "57211783163", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "55574190847": {"Name": "Anderson R.H.", "AuthorID": "55574190847", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Sciences, Newcastle University"}, "57215773733": {"Name": "oshitake S.", "AuthorID": "57215773733", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "55415919600": {"Name": "Morishita H.", "AuthorID": "55415919600", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "24466695700": {"Name": "Shinohara G.", "AuthorID": "24466695700", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "50861631900": {"Name": "Iwaki R.", "AuthorID": "50861631900", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7003799449": {"Name": "Matsuhisa H.", "AuthorID": "7003799449", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57220510849": {"Name": "Nagashima M.", "AuthorID": "57220510849", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7003800495": {"Name": "Tsukube T.", "AuthorID": "7003800495", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
