All rights reserved.The 25th Annual Congress of the International Liver Transplantation Society was held in Toronto, Canada, from May 15 to 18, 2019. Surgeons, hepatologists, anesthesiologists, critical care intensivists, radiologists, pathologists, and research scientists from all over the world came together with the common aim of improving care and outcomes for liver transplant recipients and living donors. Some of the featured topics at this year's conference included multidisciplinary perioperative care in liver transplantation, worldwide approaches to organ allocation, donor steatosis, and updates in pediatrics, immunology, and radiology. This report presents excerpts and highlights from invited lectures and select abstracts, reviewed and compiled by the Vanguard Committee of International Liver Transplantation Society. This will hopefully contribute to further advances in clinical practice and research in liver transplantation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Canada", "Child", "Congresses as Topic", "Critical Care", "Donor Selection", "End Stage Liver Disease", "Graft Rejection", "Hepatectomy", "Humans", "Immunosuppression", "International Cooperation", "Liver Transplantation", "Living Donors", "Organ Preservation", "Patient Safety", "Patient Selection", "Perfusion", "Perioperative Care", "Quality Improvement", "Resource Allocation", "Societies, Medical", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088885174", "SubjectAreas": [["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"57191846084": {"Name": "Chadha R.", "AuthorID": "57191846084", "AffiliationID": "60002333", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, Mayo Clinic"}, "57190082761": {"Name": "De Martin E.", "AuthorID": "57190082761", "AffiliationID": "60014856, 60000905, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatology, AP-HP H\u00f4pital Paul-Brousse, Centre H\u00e9pato-Biliaire, INSERM 1193"}, "8593575500": {"Name": "Kabacam G.", "AuthorID": "8593575500", "AffiliationID": "60085904", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Ankara Guven Hospital"}, "36461101900": {"Name": "Kirchner V.", "AuthorID": "36461101900", "AffiliationID": "60008772, 60009362", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, University of Minnesota Medical School, Masonic Children's Hospital"}, "55844708000": {"Name": "Kalisvaart M.", "AuthorID": "55844708000", "AffiliationID": "60019619", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, University Hospital"}, "36542380200": {"Name": "Goldaracena N.", "AuthorID": "36542380200", "AffiliationID": "60029418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Abdominal Organ Transplant and Hepatobiliary Surgery, University of Virginia Health System"}, "57218351739": {"Name": "Tanaka T.", "AuthorID": "57218351739", "AffiliationID": "60006455, 60105924", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatology, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa City VA Medical Center"}, "40762218700": {"Name": "Spiro M.", "AuthorID": "40762218700", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine, Royal Free Hospital"}, "23477902900": {"Name": "Sapisochin G.", "AuthorID": "23477902900", "AffiliationID": "60014468, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Abdominal Transplant and HPB Surgical Oncology, University Health Network, University of Toronto"}, "55648781900": {"Name": "Vinaixa C.", "AuthorID": "55648781900", "AffiliationID": "60078879, 60001602", "AffiliationName": "CIBERehd, Instituto de Salud Carlos III"}, "14026873300": {"Name": "Hessheimer A.", "AuthorID": "14026873300", "AffiliationID": "60001576, 60030315, 60010814", "AffiliationName": "Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery and Transplantation, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, University of Barcelona"}, "14062885800": {"Name": "Campos Varela I.", "AuthorID": "14062885800", "AffiliationID": "60012486", "AffiliationName": "Liver Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital Universitario Vall d'Hebr\u00f3n, Institut de Recerca"}, "57220374872": {"Name": "Rammohan A.", "AuthorID": "57220374872", "AffiliationID": "125230055", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Liver Disease and Transplantation"}, "55276571400": {"Name": "Yoon Y.I.", "AuthorID": "55276571400", "AffiliationID": "60006240, 60068691", "AffiliationName": "Division of Hepatobiliary Surgery and Liver Transplantation, Department of Surgery, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine"}, "55597150600": {"Name": "Victor D.", "AuthorID": "55597150600", "AffiliationID": "60014933", "AffiliationName": "Houston Methodist Hospital, Sherrie and Alan Conover Center for Liver Disease and Transplantation, Methodist University Hospital"}, "37027160900": {"Name": "Scalera I.", "AuthorID": "37027160900", "AffiliationID": "60033344", "AffiliationName": "Hepatobiliary and Liver Transplant Unit, A.
