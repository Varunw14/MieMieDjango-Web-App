How are housing characteristics priced in rental and owner-occupied markets? What can answers to these questions tell us about economic theories of homeownership? Using the English Housing Survey, we estimate a selection model of property allocations to the owner-occupied and rental sectors. Structural characteristics and unobserved quality are important for selection. Location is not. Accounting for selection is important for rent-to-price ratio estimates and explains some puzzling correlations between rent-to-price ratios and homeownership rates. These patterns are consistent with, among others, hypotheses of rental market contracting frictions related to housing maintenance.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088362347", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"55790567300": {"Name": "Halket J.", "AuthorID": "55790567300", "AffiliationID": "60001359", "AffiliationName": "University of Essex and CeMMAP"}, "56840582100": {"Name": "Nesheim L.", "AuthorID": "56840582100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60117041", "AffiliationName": "University College London and CeMMAP"}, "55142516400": {"Name": "Oswald F.", "AuthorID": "55142516400", "AffiliationID": "60083821", "AffiliationName": "Sciences Po"}}}
