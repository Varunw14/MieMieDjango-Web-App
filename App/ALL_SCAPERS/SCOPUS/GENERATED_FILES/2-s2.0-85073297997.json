The survey explored responses from key stakeholders who constitute the experiences of new teachers: head teachers, mentors, members of teaching staff and the NQTs themselves. Results suggest that conditions in schools, particularly the effects of leadership, are prime factors influencing the realization of national policy aimed at supporting NQTs. Questions are raised about how principled induction and mentoring can be achieved at scale in the context of variable, powerful school cultures. A disconnection from induction and mentoring by the majority of school staff, including leaders, is identified as a serious obstacle to be addressed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Induction", "Mentoring", "Newly qualified teachers", "NQTs"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073297997", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"37051097500": {"Name": "Langdon F.", "AuthorID": "37051097500", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "University of Auckland"}, "23024120700": {"Name": "Daly C.", "AuthorID": "23024120700", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "57195489376": {"Name": "Milton E.", "AuthorID": "57195489376", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff University"}, "7404727247": {"Name": "Jones K.", "AuthorID": "7404727247", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "55626773100": {"Name": "Palmer M.", "AuthorID": "55626773100", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King\u2019s College London"}}}
