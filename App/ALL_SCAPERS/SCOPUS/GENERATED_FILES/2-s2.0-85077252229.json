This article examines the operation of these restrictions in the United Kingdom. It draws on qualitative research with civil servants and NGO expert advisors, and applies sociological theories on bureaucracy as a lens to interpret these data. Conceptually, the paper employs a generative synthesis of Ritzer\u2019s notion of \u201cirrational rationality\u201d and Foucault\u2019s perspective on \u201cgovernmentality\u201d to explain observed outcomes. Findings show that public service workers struggle with complex and opaque regulations, which grant different entitlements to different categories of migrants. The confusion results in mistakes, arbitrary decisions, and hypercorrection, but also a system-wide indifference to irrational outcomes, supported by human factors in contexts of austerity. I consider this a form of governmentality-effected neglect, where power operates as much through inaction as well as through intention, but which results in exclusions of legal migrants that are harsher in practice than in law.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bureaucracy", "governmentality", "immigration", "rationality", "rights", "welfare"], "IndexKeywords": ["Emigrants and Immigrants", "Emigration and Immigration", "Government Employees", "Government Programs", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "Qualitative Research", "Rationalization", "Social Work", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077252229", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"35727255100": {"Name": "Oliver C.", "AuthorID": "35727255100", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
