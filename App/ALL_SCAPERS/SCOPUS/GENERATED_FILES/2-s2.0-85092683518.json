We have been commissioned to conduct an independent evaluation of a major national change programme, the Global Digital Exemplar (GDE) Programme, which aims to develop exemplary digital health solutions and encourage their wider adoption by creating a learning ecosystem across English National Health Service (NHS) provider organisations. Methods and analysis This theoretically informed, qualitative, longitudinal formative evaluation comprises five inter-related work packages. We will conduct a combination of 12 in-depth and 24 broader qualitative case studies in GDE sites exploring digital transformation, local learning and mechanisms of spread of knowledge within the Programme and across the wider NHS. Data will be collected through a combination of semistructured interviews with managers, implementation staff (clinical and non-clinical), vendors and policymakers, plus non-participant observations of meetings, site visits, workshops and documentary analysis of strategic local and national plans. Data will be analysed through inductive and deductive methods, beginning with in-depth case study sites and testing the findings against data from the wider sample and national stakeholders. Ethics and dissemination This work is commissioned as part of a national change programme and is therefore a service evaluation. We have ethical approval from the University of Edinburgh. Results will be disseminated at six monthly intervals to national policymakers, and made available via our publicly accessible website. We will also identify lessons for the management and evaluation of large-scale evolving digital health change programmes that are of international relevance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["health informatics", "health policy", "qualitative research"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092683518", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"22933669600": {"Name": "Cresswell K.", "AuthorID": "22933669600", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"}, "57209873322": {"Name": "Sheikh A.", "AuthorID": "57209873322", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"}, "54787801900": {"Name": "Krasuska M.", "AuthorID": "54787801900", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"}, "57196257915": {"Name": "Dean Franklin B.", "AuthorID": "57196257915", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57216962625": {"Name": "Nguyen H.", "AuthorID": "57216962625", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Political Science, University of Edinburgh"}, "24376259600": {"Name": "Hinder S.", "AuthorID": "24376259600", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Political Science, University of Edinburgh"}, "55817853400": {"Name": "Williams R.", "AuthorID": "55817853400", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Political Science, University of Edinburgh"}, "57210862484": {"Name": "Lane W.", "AuthorID": "57210862484", "AffiliationID": "123115042", "AffiliationName": "Nhs Arden and Greater East Midlands Commissioning Support Unit"}, "57210861196": {"Name": "Mason K.", "AuthorID": "57210861196", "AffiliationID": "123115042", "AffiliationName": "Nhs Arden and Greater East Midlands Commissioning Support Unit"}, "57210862938": {"Name": "Eason S.", "AuthorID": "57210862938", "AffiliationID": "123115042", "AffiliationName": "Nhs Arden and Greater East Midlands Commissioning Support Unit"}, "26326955500": {"Name": "Mozaffar H.", "AuthorID": "26326955500", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Business School, University of Edinburgh"}, "12783188400": {"Name": "Potts H.", "AuthorID": "12783188400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Informatics and Multiprofessional Education, University College London"}}}
