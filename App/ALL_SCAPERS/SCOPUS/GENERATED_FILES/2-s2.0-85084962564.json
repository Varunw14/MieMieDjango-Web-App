Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Background: Weight can be adjusted for height using the Benn parameter (kg/mB), where B is the power that minimises the correlation with height. Aim: To investigate how the Benn parameter changes across age (10\u201365 years) and time (1956\u20132015) and differs between sexes. Subjects and methods: The sample comprised 49,717 individuals born in 1946, 1958, 1970 or 2001. Cross-sectional estimates of the Benn parameter were produced and cohort differences at ages 10/11 and 42/43 years were examined using linear regression. Multilevel modelling was used to develop trajectories showing how the Benn parameter changed over age from childhood to mid-adulthood in the three older cohorts. Results: The Benn parameter was closest to 2 in childhood but consistently lower across adulthood, particularly in females and the most recent cohort. At ages 10/11 years, the Benn parameter was greater than 3 in both sexes in the 2001 cohort but between 2.2 and 2.7 in the three older cohorts. This difference was estimated to be +0.67 (0.53, 0.81) in males and +0.53 (0.38, 0.68) in females, compared to the 1946 cohort, and was driven by a much higher weight SD in the 2001 cohort. Conversely, at ages 42/43 years, the Benn parameter was lowest in the 1970 cohort due to a slightly lower weight-height correlation. This difference was estimated to be \u22120.12 (\u22120.34, 0.10) in males and \u22120.15 (\u22120.42, 0.13) in females, compared to the 1946 cohort. Conclusions: Changes over time in the obesogenic environment appear to have firstly reduced the Benn parameter due to a lowering of the weight-height correlation but secondly and more drastically increased the Benn parameter due to increasing weight variation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Benn parameter", "birth year cohort", "Body mass index", "secular trend", "trajectory"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Body Height", "Body Mass Index", "Body Weight", "Child", "Cohort Studies", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Parturition", "Sex Factors", "Waist-Height Ratio"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084962564", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"35431196500": {"Name": "Johnson W.", "AuthorID": "35431196500", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University"}, "55930436300": {"Name": "Norris T.", "AuthorID": "55930436300", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University"}, "7103056131": {"Name": "Cameron N.", "AuthorID": "7103056131", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University"}, "55790281500": {"Name": "Bann D.", "AuthorID": "55790281500", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Longitudinal Studies, UCL Institute of Education"}, "57204543012": {"Name": "Wells J.K.", "AuthorID": "57204543012", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7201770477": {"Name": "Cole T.J.", "AuthorID": "7201770477", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57204025615": {"Name": "Hardy R.", "AuthorID": "57204025615", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "CLOSER, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
