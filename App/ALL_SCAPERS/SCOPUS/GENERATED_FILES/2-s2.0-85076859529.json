This study aimed to assess whether dual e-cigarette users have lower smoking cessation rates than (i) exclusive cigarette smokers or (ii) dual users of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and cigarettes. Methods: Prospective cohort study of 1,498 smokers in England. The independent variable was dual use of e-cigarettes (n = 292), dual use of NRT (n = 117), or exclusive smoking (n = 1089), assessed at baseline. Outcomes were overall quit rate, past-year quit attempts, and success of quit attempts at 12-month follow-up. Baseline sociodemographic and smoking-related covariates were included. Results: Overall quit rates were not lower in dual e-cigarette users than exclusive smokers (OR = 1.31, 0.90\u20131.89). Dual users of e-cigarettes were more likely than exclusive smokers to make a quit attempt, but this difference was not significant after adjustment for covariates (OR = 1.27, 95%CI 0.95\u20131.69). Among those attempting to quit, success rates did not differ significantly. Dual users of e-cigarettes were less likely to make a quit attempt than dual users of NRT (OR = 0.61, 95%CI 0.38\u20130.98) but the success rate of quit attempts and overall quit rates did not differ significantly. Conclusions: In England, dual use of e-cigarettes is not associated with reduced overall quit rates compared with exclusive smoking or dual use of NRT. However, dual use of e-cigarettes is associated with a slightly higher quit attempt rate than exclusive smoking but lower than dual use of NRT.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dual use", "E-cigarettes", "Nicotine replacement therapy", "Quit attempts", "Quit success", "Smoking cessation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Smoking Cessation", "Tobacco Smoking", "Tobacco Use Cessation Devices", "Vaping", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076859529", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Toxicology", "PHAR", "3005"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57196323380": {"Name": "Jackson S.E.", "AuthorID": "57196323380", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "15123109500": {"Name": "Shahab L.", "AuthorID": "15123109500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "7402396010": {"Name": "West R.", "AuthorID": "7402396010", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "55547124591": {"Name": "Brown J.", "AuthorID": "55547124591", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}}}
