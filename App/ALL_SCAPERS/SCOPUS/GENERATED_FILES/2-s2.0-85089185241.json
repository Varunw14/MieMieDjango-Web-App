Published by Research Publishing, Singapore.The Control of Major Accident Hazards (COMAH) regulations, governing UK process plants, requires the use of Human Reliability Analysis techniques such as Human Factors Critical Task Review (HFCTR) for COMAH-critical tasks. The process of HFCTR involves a task analysis, human failure analysis and Performance Influencing Factors (PIF) analysis of a safety critical task. The overall intended outcome of HFCTR is risk reduction through a detailed task structure, design recommendations, and the management of PIFs. Despite their importance there has been relatively little work on the quality of HFCTR. We reflect on over fifty years of combined experience working in this sector to explore the performance variability of HFCTR. We present the findings of the FRAM (Functional Resonance Analysis Method) analysis, strategies for success, and case studies highlighting variability in HFCTR application. This provides insight into what makes HFCTR flourish or stall.", "AuthorKeywords": ["COMAH", "FRAM", "Human Factors Critical Task Review", "Process safety", "Safety Critical Task Analysis", "SHERPA"], "IndexKeywords": ["Control of Major Accident Hazards", "Design recommendations", "Functional resonance", "Human reliability analysis", "Performance influencing factors", "Performance variability", "Process plants", "Risk reductions"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089185241", "SubjectAreas": [["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"], ["Safety Research", "SOCI", "3311"]], "AuthorData": {"36165110400": {"Name": "Furniss D.", "AuthorID": "36165110400", "AffiliationID": "124936466", "AffiliationName": "Human Reliability Associates Ltd."}, "57219857603": {"Name": "Sujan M.", "AuthorID": "57219857603", "AffiliationID": "124936466", "AffiliationName": "Human Reliability Associates Ltd."}, "57199674082": {"Name": "Henderson J.", "AuthorID": "57199674082", "AffiliationID": "124936466", "AffiliationName": "Human Reliability Associates Ltd."}, "7004127126": {"Name": "Embrey D.", "AuthorID": "7004127126", "AffiliationID": "124936466", "AffiliationName": "Human Reliability Associates Ltd."}}}
