We study the interfering channel estimation, where the radar is operated in the 'search and track' mode, and the BS receives the interference from the radar. Unlike the conventional methods where the radar and the cellular systems fully cooperate with each other, in this paper, we consider that they are uncoordinated and the BS needs to acquire the interfering channel state information (ICSI) by exploiting the radar probing waveforms. For completeness, both the line-of-sight (LoS) and Non-LoS (NLoS) channels are considered in the coexistence scenario. By further assuming that the BS has limited a priori knowledge about the radar waveforms, we propose several hypothesis testing methods to identify the working mode of the radar, and then obtain the ICSI through a variety of channel estimation schemes. Based on the statistical theory, we analyze the theoretical performance of both the hypothesis testing and the channel estimation methods. Finally, the simulation results verify the effectiveness of our theoretical analysis and demonstrate that the BS can effectively estimate the interfering channel even with the limited information from the radar.", "AuthorKeywords": ["channel estimation", "hypothesis testing", "Radar-communication coexistence", "search and track"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cellular base stations", "Channel estimation method", "Conventional methods", "Hypothesis testing", "Interfering channels", "Radar communication", "search and track", "Theoretical performance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072228350", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"57211818673": {"Name": "Liu F.", "AuthorID": "57211818673", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "23009493900": {"Name": "Masouros C.", "AuthorID": "23009493900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56349424500": {"Name": "Garcia-Rodriguez A.", "AuthorID": "56349424500", "AffiliationID": "60021378", "AffiliationName": "Nokia Bell Labs"}, "55028597300": {"Name": "Geraci G.", "AuthorID": "55028597300", "AffiliationID": "60032942", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information and Communication Technologies, Universitat Pompeu Fabra"}}}
