Although responses of SPNs to cutaneous receptive field stimulations have been intensively studied, the mechanisms of signal processing in these neurons are poorly understood. Therefore, we used an ex-vivo spinal cord preparation to examine synaptic and cellular mechanisms determining specific input-output characteristics of the neurons. The vast majority of the SPNs received a few direct nociceptive C-fiber inputs and generated one spike in response to saturating afferent stimulation, thus functioning as simple transducers of painful stimulus. However, 69% of afferent stimulation-induced action potentials in the entire SPN population originated from a small fraction (19%) of high-output neurons. These neurons received a larger number of direct A\u03b4- and C-fiber inputs, generated intrinsic bursts and efficiently integrated a local network activity via NMDA-receptor-dependent mechanisms. The high-output SPNs amplified and integrated the nociceptive input gradually encoding its intensity into the number of generated spikes. Thus, different mechanisms of signal processing allow lamina I SPNs to play distinct roles in nociception.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials", "Nerve Fibers, Unmyelinated", "Neurons", "Nociception", "Rats", "Rats, Wistar", "Spinal Cord", "Synapses"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076516732", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56939252500": {"Name": "Krotov V.", "AuthorID": "56939252500", "AffiliationID": "60068502", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Biophysics, Bogomoletz Institute of Physiology"}, "7004169205": {"Name": "Belan P.", "AuthorID": "7004169205", "AffiliationID": "100513908", "AffiliationName": "Kyiv Academic University"}, "57198422240": {"Name": "Agashkov K.", "AuthorID": "57198422240", "AffiliationID": "60068502", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sensory Signaling, Bogomoletz Institute of Physiology"}, "57212380108": {"Name": "Krasniakova M.", "AuthorID": "57212380108", "AffiliationID": "60068502", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sensory Signaling, Bogomoletz Institute of Physiology"}, "57198422042": {"Name": "Shevchuk D.", "AuthorID": "57198422042", "AffiliationID": "100513908", "AffiliationName": "Kyiv Academic University"}, "57212391532": {"Name": "Andrianov Y.", "AuthorID": "57212391532", "AffiliationID": "100513908", "AffiliationName": "Kyiv Academic University"}, "57204520755": {"Name": "Zabenko Y.", "AuthorID": "57204520755", "AffiliationID": "60068502", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sensory Signaling, Bogomoletz Institute of Physiology"}, "7006963590": {"Name": "Voitenko N.", "AuthorID": "7006963590", "AffiliationID": "100513908", "AffiliationName": "Kyiv Academic University"}, "7004457466": {"Name": "Safronov B.V.", "AuthorID": "7004457466", "AffiliationID": "60004346, 60007249", "AffiliationName": "Neuronal Networks Group, Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular (IBMC), Universidade do Porto"}}}
