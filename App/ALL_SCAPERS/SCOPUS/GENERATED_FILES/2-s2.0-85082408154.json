However, existing rulers can suffer from poor nanometre resolution due to the flexible nature of linkers used to tether to the DNA framework. We aimed to overcome this problem using zinc and free-base porphyrin chromophores attached via short and rigid acetylene linkers. This connectivity enables the distance and angle between the porphyrins to be fine-tuned along the DNA scaffold. The porphyrins undergo favorable energy transfer and chiral exciton coupling interactions to act as highly sensitive molecular ruler probes. To validate the system, we monitored the detection of small changes in DNA structure upon intercalation of ethidium bromide. CD spectroscopy showed the porphyrins undergo highly sensitive changes in excitation coupling to facilitate base pair resolution of the novel system.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CD spectroscopy", "DNA", "ethidium bromide intercalation", "exciton coupling", "FRET", "porphyrin"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082408154", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"37087024100": {"Name": "Burns J.R.", "AuthorID": "37087024100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55925925700": {"Name": "Wood J.W.", "AuthorID": "55925925700", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry Institute for Life Sciences, University of Southampton"}, "6603878756": {"Name": "Stulz E.", "AuthorID": "6603878756", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry Institute for Life Sciences, University of Southampton"}}}
