Such experiments are typically performed in human or animal skin in vitro; however, ethical and safety considerations are associated with obtaining these tissues. Several human skin equivalent models (HSEs) have been developed as alternatives to human tissue. The barrier function of such models however, is normally less developed than human skin. Here, we examine the permeability of the HSE LabSkinTM to a model compound, 3-O-ethyl-l-ascorbic acid (EA) compared with human skin. METHODS: Skin uptake and permeation of EA was investigated in vitro using heat-separated human epidermis and LabSkinTM. Finite dose (5 \u03bcL cm-2) Franz-diffusion studies were conducted using 2 % (w/w) EA in a ternary solvent mixture comprising propylene glycol (PG), propylene glycol monolaurate (PGML), and isopropyl myristate (IPM). These excipients are commonly used in cosmetic products and they have been reported to promote permeation of EA in a different model, namely porcine skin. RESULTS: Permeation of EA through LabSkinTM was evident from 2 h; however, EA permeation in human skin was not detected until 5 h. Similar amounts of EA permeated through the two membranes at time points 8, 10, 12 and 24 h (p > 0.05). The cumulative amounts of EA delivered through LabSkinTM at 24 h were 41.3 \u00b1 2.0 \u00b5g cm\u22122, corresponding to 55.1 \u00b1 1.8 % of the applied dose. Similar amounts permeated across human skin, 49.4 \u00b1 4.1 \u00b5g cm\u22122, accounting for 58.0 \u00b1 4.2 % of the dose applied (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The permeation of EA in LabSkinTM compared well with results for human epidermis in terms of the permeation profiles and the cumulative amounts of EA that permeated. The data suggest that the skin barrier of the two models was similar with regard to their overall permeability to the hydrophilic active EA. The findings are promising for the use of LabSkinTM as a surrogate for human skin in permeability testing. Future studies will focus on exploring the reproducibility and robustness of LabSkinTM for delivery of other actives that span a range of physicochemical properties.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3-O-ethyl-l-ascorbic acid", "human skin equivalent", "LabSkin\u2122", "skin barrier", "skin delivery"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85098077383", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (miscellaneous)", "CHEM", "1601"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"], ["Colloid and Surface Chemistry", "CENG", "1505"]], "AuthorData": {"57221772289": {"Name": "Iliopoulos F.", "AuthorID": "57221772289", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "56393831400": {"Name": "Lane M.E.", "AuthorID": "56393831400", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "57221054116": {"Name": "Chapman A.", "AuthorID": "57221054116", "AffiliationID": "116798122", "AffiliationName": "Innovenn UK Ltd."}}}
