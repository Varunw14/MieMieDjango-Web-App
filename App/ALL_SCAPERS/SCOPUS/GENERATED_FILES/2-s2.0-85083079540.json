All rights reserved.Our ability to recognize objects in peripheral vision is fundamentally limited by crowding, the deleterious effect of clutter that disrupts the recognition of features ranging from orientation and color to motion and depth. Previous research is equivocal on whether this reflects a singular process that disrupts all features simultaneously or multiple processes that affect each independently. We examined crowding for motion and color, two features that allow a strong test of feature independence. \"Cowhide\" stimuli were presented 15\u00b0 in peripheral vision, either in isolation or surrounded by flankers to give crowding. Observers reported either the target direction (clockwise/counterclockwise from upward) or its hue (blue/purple). We first established that both features show systematic crowded errors (biased predominantly toward the flanker identities) and selectivity for target-flanker similarity (with reduced crowding for dissimilar target/flanker elements). The multiplicity of crowding was then tested with observers identifying both features. Here, a singular object-selective mechanism predicts that when crowding is weak for one feature and strong for the other that crowding should be all-or-none for both. In contrast, when crowding was weak for color and strong for motion, errors were reduced for color but remained for motion, and vice versa with weak motion and strong color crowding. This double dissociation reveals that crowding disrupts certain combinations of visual features in a feature-specific manner, ruling out a singular object-selective mechanism. Thus, the ability to recognize one aspect of a cluttered scene, like color, offers no guarantees for the correct recognition of other aspects, like motion.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Color", "Crowding", "Motion", "Perception", "Peripheral vision"], "IndexKeywords": ["Attention", "Color", "Color Vision", "Crowding", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Models, Neurological", "Motion", "Photic Stimulation", "Visual Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083079540", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55658057130": {"Name": "Greenwood J.A.", "AuthorID": "55658057130", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "57216313101": {"Name": "Parsons M.J.", "AuthorID": "57216313101", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}}}
