Oral Surgery published by British Association of Oral Surgeons and John Wiley & Sons LtdTrigeminal neuralgia (TN) and trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs) can cause severe facial pain. The differential diagnosis can be very challenging as both present with a sudden, usually unilateral, severe, recurrent pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve; with TACs including one or more autonomic symptom. A light touch can trigger the pain and it will stop patients from their daily activities creating a significant impact on their quality of life. Patients will present with pain to the dentist or doctor even to accident and emergency and they could receive incorrect and sometimes irreversible treatment. Clinical and radiographic examination, including a magnetic-resonance imaging, are essential to establish diagnosis and a referral to a specialist should be considered. The long-term treatment for TN could be pharmacological or surgical and patients should be informed their options, benefits as well as their side effects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["diagnosis", "facial pain", "headache", "MRI", "trigeminal neuralgia"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077882468", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Oral Surgery", "DENT", "3504"]], "AuthorData": {"57193356685": {"Name": "Besi E.", "AuthorID": "57193356685", "AffiliationID": "60176144", "AffiliationName": "Edinburgh Dental Institute"}, "56810833400": {"Name": "Zakrzewska J.M.", "AuthorID": "56810833400", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Pain Management Centre, National Hospital for Neurology & Neurosurgery, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
