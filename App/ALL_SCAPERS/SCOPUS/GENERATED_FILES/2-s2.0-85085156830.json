However, in light of increasing data pointing to a role for humoral immunity in controlling M. tuberculosis infection, here, we aimed to define whether HIV infection also alters the humoral immune response in subjects with active and latent TB. We show that in the setting of active TB, HIV-positive individuals have significantly lower IgG responses to LAM and Ag85 than HIV-negative individuals. Furthermore, significant isotype/subclass-specific differences were frequently observed, with active TB, HIVpositive individuals demonstrating compromised antigen-specific IgM titers. HIV-infected individuals with active TB also exhibited a significant loss of influenza hemagglutininand tetanus toxoid-specific antibody titers at the isotype/subclass level, a symptom of broad humoral immune dysfunction likely precipitated by HIV infection. Finally, we illustrated that despite the influence of HIV infection, differences in M. tuberculosis-specific antibody profiles persist between latent and active TB disease. Taken together, these findings reveal significant HIV-associated disruptions of the humoral immune response in HIV/TB-coinfected individuals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antibodies", "Coinfection", "HIV", "Humoral immunity", "Tuberculosis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085156830", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"57204472672": {"Name": "van Woudenbergh E.", "AuthorID": "57204472672", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard"}, "57209285377": {"Name": "Irvine E.B.", "AuthorID": "57209285377", "AffiliationID": "60032499", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Harvard T.
