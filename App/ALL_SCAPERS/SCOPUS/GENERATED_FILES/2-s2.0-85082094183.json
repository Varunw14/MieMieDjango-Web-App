Because of its increased sensitivity, a negative HPV test is more reassuring for a woman that she is at low risk for precancerous cervical lesions than a negative Pap test. Prompted by the inadequate translation of HPV test-based screening guidelines into practice, we aimed to synthesize the literature regarding health care providers (HCPs) knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to HPV testing and the influence of psychosocial factors on HCPs acceptability of HPV testing in primary cervical cancer screening. Materials and Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Global Health, and Web of Science for journal articles from January 1, 1980 to July 25, 2018. A narrative synthesis of HCPs knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to HPV testing is provided. Informed by the Patient Pathway framework, we used deductive thematic analysis to synthesize the influence of psychosocial factors on HCPs acceptability of HPV testing. Results: The most important HCP knowledge gaps are related to the superior sensitivity of the HPV test and age-specific guideline recommendations for HPV testing. Thirty to fifty percent of HCPs are not compliant with guideline recommendations for HPV testing, for example, screening at shorter intervals than recommended. Barriers, facilitators, and contradictory evidence of HCPs' acceptability of the HPV test are grouped by category: (1) factors related to the HCP; (2) patient intrinsic factors; (3) factors corresponding to HCP's practice environment; and (4) health care system factors. Conclusions: HCP's adherence to guidelines for HPV testing in cervical cancer screening is suboptimal and could be improved by specialty organizations ensuring consistency across guidelines. Targeted educational interventions to address barriers of HPV test acceptability identified in this review may facilitate the translation of HPV testing recommendations into practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["attitudes and beliefs", "cervical cancer screening", "cervical cancer screening guidelines", "health care providers", "HPV test", "HPV test acceptability", "knowledge"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia", "Early Detection of Cancer", "Female", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Health Personnel", "Humans", "Papanicolaou Test", "Papillomaviridae", "Papillomavirus Infections", "Uterine Cervical Neoplasms", "Vaginal Smears"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082094183", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57190742498": {"Name": "Tatar O.", "AuthorID": "57190742498", "AffiliationID": "60022165, 60018916", "AffiliationName": "Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Jewish General Hospital"}, "57203729035": {"Name": "Wade K.", "AuthorID": "57203729035", "AffiliationID": "60022165, 60018916", "AffiliationName": "Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Jewish General Hospital"}, "6603388712": {"Name": "Rosberger Z.", "AuthorID": "6603388712", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology Psychiatry and Oncology, McGill University"}, "57192714631": {"Name": "McBride E.", "AuthorID": "57192714631", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, University College London"}, "57191898211": {"Name": "Waller J.", "AuthorID": "57191898211", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, University College London"}, "55512070900": {"Name": "Thompson E.", "AuthorID": "55512070900", "AffiliationID": "60010544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Behavior and Health Systems, School of Public Health, University of North Texas Health Science Center"}, "41561465500": {"Name": "Head K.J.", "AuthorID": "41561465500", "AffiliationID": "60024609", "AffiliationName": "Department of Communication Studies, IU School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI"}, "7202103438": {"Name": "Perez S.", "AuthorID": "7202103438", "AffiliationID": "121416140", "AffiliationName": "Mont Royal Psychology"}, "25824026100": {"Name": "Shapiro G.K.", "AuthorID": "25824026100", "AffiliationID": "60008768", "AffiliationName": "Department of Supportive Care, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre"}, "7003441652": {"Name": "Zimet G.", "AuthorID": "7003441652", "AffiliationID": "60021947", "AffiliationName": "Section of Adolescent Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine"}}}
