Liver International published by John Wiley & Sons LtdBackground: Anaemia is common in advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD) as a result of various risk factors. Aims & Methods: We evaluated the prevalence and severity of anaemia as well as the impact of anaemia on clinical outcomes in consecutive patients with ACLD and portal hypertension. Results: Among 494 patients, 324 (66%) patients had anaemia. Anaemic patients showed higher MELD (12 \u00b1 4 vs 9 \u00b1 3; P <.001), lower albumin (34 \u00b1 6 vs 39 \u00b1 5 g/dL; P <.001) and more often Child-Pugh B/C stage (56% vs 17%; P <.001). The prevalence of moderate-severe anaemia (haemoglobin <10 g/dL) increased with the degree of portal hypertension (HVPG: 6-9 mm Hg: 22% vs HVPG: 10-19 mm Hg: 24% vs HVPG \u2265 20 mm Hg: 36%; P =.031). The most common aetiologies of anaemia were gastrointestinal bleeding (25%) and iron deficiency (9%), while reason for anaemia remained unclear in 53% of cases. Male gender (odds ratio [OR]: 1.94 [95% CI: 1.09-3.47]; P =.025), MELD (OR: 1.20 [95% CI: 1.09-1.32]; P <.001), hepatic decompensation (OR: 4.40 [95% CI: 2.48-7.82]; P <.001) and HVPG (OR per mm Hg: 1.07 [95% CI: 1.02-1.13]; P =.004) were independent risk factors for anaemia. Anaemia was associated with hepatic decompensation (1 year: 25.1% vs 8.1%; 5 years: 60.3% vs 32.9%; P <.0001), hospitalization (73% vs 57%; P <.001) and a higher incidence rate of acute-on-chronic liver failure (0.05 [95% CI: 0.04-0.07] vs 0.03 [95% CI: 0.01-0.04]). Anaemic patients had worse overall survival (1 year: 87.1% vs 93.7%, 5 year survival: 50.5% vs 68.6%; P <.0001) and increased liver-related mortality (1 year mortality: 9.7% vs 5.7%, 5 year mortality: 38.0% vs 26.9%; P =.003). Conclusion: Two-thirds of patients with ACLD suffer from anaemia. The degree of hepatic dysfunction and of portal hypertension correlate with severity of anaemia. Anaemia is associated with decompensation, ACLF and increased mortality in patients with ACLD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["advanced chronic liver disease", "anaemia", "portal hypertension", "prevalence", "severity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073801325", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"]], "AuthorData": {"55803009600": {"Name": "Scheiner B.", "AuthorID": "55803009600", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Laboratory, Medical University of Vienna"}, "57203747589": {"Name": "Semmler G.", "AuthorID": "57203747589", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Laboratory, Medical University of Vienna"}, "57211408056": {"Name": "Maurer F.", "AuthorID": "57211408056", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Laboratory, Medical University of Vienna"}, "35485391200": {"Name": "Schwabl P.", "AuthorID": "35485391200", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Laboratory, Medical University of Vienna"}, "56176028800": {"Name": "Bucsics T.A.", "AuthorID": "56176028800", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Laboratory, Medical University of Vienna"}, "56521656600": {"Name": "Paternostro R.", "AuthorID": "56521656600", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Laboratory, Medical University of Vienna"}, "57195487529": {"Name": "Bauer D.", "AuthorID": "57195487529", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Laboratory, Medical University of Vienna"}, "56658776100": {"Name": "Simbrunner B.", "AuthorID": "56658776100", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Laboratory, Medical University of Vienna"}, "7006061605": {"Name": "Trauner M.", "AuthorID": "7006061605", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna"}, "55369068500": {"Name": "Mandorfer M.", "AuthorID": "55369068500", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Laboratory, Medical University of Vienna"}, "24315181000": {"Name": "Reiberger T.", "AuthorID": "24315181000", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Laboratory, Medical University of Vienna"}}}
