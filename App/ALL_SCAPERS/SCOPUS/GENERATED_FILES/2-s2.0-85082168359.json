The frequency and temperature stability of the nano-oscillator was measured over several days allowing us to identify the major sources of trap and environmental fluctuations. We measure an overall frequency stability of 2 ppm h-1 and a temperature stability of more than 5 h via the Allan deviation. Importantly, we find that the charge on the nanoscillator is stable over a timescale of at least two weeks and that the mass of the oscillator, can be measured with a 3% uncertainty. This allows us to distinguish between the trapping of a single nanosphere and a nano-dumbbell formed by a cluster of two nanospheres.", "AuthorKeywords": ["nanoparticle", "Paul trap", "quantum mechanics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Allan deviation", "Environmental fluctuations", "Nano-oscillator", "Paul trap", "Temperature stability", "Time-scales"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082168359", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"]], "AuthorData": {"57197775095": {"Name": "Bullier N.P.", "AuthorID": "57197775095", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "23989469900": {"Name": "Pontin A.", "AuthorID": "23989469900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57203084776": {"Name": "Barker P.F.", "AuthorID": "57203084776", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
