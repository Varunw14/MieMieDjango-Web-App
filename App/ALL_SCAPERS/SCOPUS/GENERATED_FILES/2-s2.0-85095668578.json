Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.Objective. Direct electrical stimulation of the brain through intracranial electrodes is currently used to probe the epileptic brain as part of pre-surgical evaluation, and it is also being considered for therapeutic treatments through neuromodulation. In order to effectively modulate neural activity, a given neuromodulation design must elicit similar responses throughout the course of treatment. However, it is unknown whether intracranial electrical stimulation responses are consistent across sessions. The objective of this study was to investigate the within-subject, cross-session consistency of the electrophysiological effect of electrical stimulation delivered through intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG). Approach. We analysed data from 79 epilepsy patients implanted with iEEG who underwent brain stimulation as part of a memory experiment. We quantified the effect of stimulation in terms of band power modulation and compared this effect from session to session. As a reference, we made the same measurements during baseline periods. Main results. In most sessions, the effect of stimulation on band power could not be distinguished from baseline fluctuations of band power. Stimulation effect was consistent in a third of the session pairs, while the rest had a consistency measure not exceeding the baseline standards. Cross-session consistency was highly correlated with the degree of band power increase, and it also tended to be higher when the baseline conditions were more similar between sessions. Significance. These findings can inform our practices for designing neuromodulation with greater efficacy when using direct electrical brain stimulation as a therapeutic treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["brain stimulation", "direct electrical stimulation", "drug-resistant epilepsy", "electrocorticogram", "frequency bands", "neuromodulation", "response variability"], "IndexKeywords": ["Base-line conditions", "Baseline fluctuations", "Brain stimulation", "Consistency measures", "Electrical stimulations", "Highly-correlated", "Surgical evaluations", "Therapeutic treatments"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095668578", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"56543797700": {"Name": "Papasavvas C.A.", "AuthorID": "56543797700", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Cnnp Lab (Www.cnnp-lab.com), Interdisciplinary Computing and Complex BioSystems Group, School of Computing, Newcastle University"}, "57191565289": {"Name": "Schroeder G.M.", "AuthorID": "57191565289", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Cnnp Lab (Www.cnnp-lab.com), Interdisciplinary Computing and Complex BioSystems Group, School of Computing, Newcastle University"}, "55504037100": {"Name": "Taylor P.N.", "AuthorID": "55504037100", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medical Sciences, Newcastle University"}, "56457888300": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "56457888300", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medical Sciences, Newcastle University"}, "7003810636": {"Name": "Diehl B.", "AuthorID": "7003810636", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Ucl Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "57206261695": {"Name": "Baier G.", "AuthorID": "57206261695", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cell and Developmental Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}}}
