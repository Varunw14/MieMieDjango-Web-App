American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.The separatrix region is the region between the separatrix and the reconnection jet. Due to the E\u00d7B drift and velocity filter effect in which high-energy particles with high parallel speed can be seen prior to low-energy particles along the field line, electrons are separated from ions. The electron dynamics in this region is of interest; however it has not been studied in detail, because of the insufficient resolution of plasma data. We present a slow separatrix crossing event observed by Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) satellite constellation on 1 January 2016, from the magnetosheath side with high-resolution burst mode data. The electron edge and ion edge are clearly distinguished in the separatrix region. Two types of electron dispersion, one with a short duration (~0.3 s) and the other with a longer duration (~13 s) were detected between the electron and ion edges. The rapid dispersion (with small time scale) is mainly in the parallel direction, which might originate from a thin layer with non-frozen-in electrons close to the separatrix. The gradual (long time scale) dispersion is seen from parallel to perpendicular directions, which comes from the E\u00d7B drift of a curved D-shape distribution of electrons. The width of the electron diffusion region on the magnetosheath side is estimated based on MMS observation. The observation also reveals an unexpected parallel electron beam outside of the electron edge. Wave-particle interaction or parallel potential in the inflow region may be responsible for the generation of this electron population.", "AuthorKeywords": ["electron edge", "energy dispersion", "ion edge", "magnetic reconnection", "separatrix"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072033354", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Forestry", "AGRI", "1107"], ["Oceanography", "EART", "1910"], ["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"], ["Soil Science", "AGRI", "1111"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"], ["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"], ["Paleontology", "EART", "1911"]], "AuthorData": {"57190067680": {"Name": "Bai S.C.", "AuthorID": "57190067680", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, University of California"}, "13605264100": {"Name": "Shi Q.", "AuthorID": "13605264100", "AffiliationID": "60108071", "AffiliationName": "Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Optical Astronomy and Solar-Terrestrial Environment, School of Space Science and Physics, Shandong University"}, "57203262368": {"Name": "Tian A.", "AuthorID": "57203262368", "AffiliationID": "60108071", "AffiliationName": "Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Optical Astronomy and Solar-Terrestrial Environment, School of Space Science and Physics, Shandong University"}, "6603982437": {"Name": "Degeling A.W.", "AuthorID": "6603982437", "AffiliationID": "60108071", "AffiliationName": "Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Optical Astronomy and Solar-Terrestrial Environment, School of Space Science and Physics, Shandong University"}, "35274038100": {"Name": "Yue C.", "AuthorID": "35274038100", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, University of California"}, "7006197877": {"Name": "Zong Q.G.", "AuthorID": "7006197877", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Space Sciences, Peking University"}, "7006788329": {"Name": "Pu Z.Y.", "AuthorID": "7006788329", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Space Sciences, Peking University"}, "55615539900": {"Name": "Fu S.", "AuthorID": "55615539900", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Space Sciences, Peking University"}, "56490422400": {"Name": "Wang X.", "AuthorID": "56490422400", "AffiliationID": "60019616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Harbin Institute of Technology"}, "7003431703": {"Name": "Rae I.J.", "AuthorID": "7003431703", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, Space and Climate Physics, University College London"}}}
