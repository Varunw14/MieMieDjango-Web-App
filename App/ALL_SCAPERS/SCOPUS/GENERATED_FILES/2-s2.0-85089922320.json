All rights reserved.Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a presenile neurodegenerative disease for which there is no effective pharmacological treatment. Recently, a link has been proposed between neuroinflammation and FTD. Objective: Here, we aim to investigate the effects of palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) combined with luteoline (PEA-LUT), an endocannabinoid with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects, on behavior, cognition, and cortical activity in a sample of FTD patients. Methods: Seventeen patients with a diagnosis of probable FTD were enrolled. Cognitive and neurophysiological evaluations were performed at baseline and after 4 weeks of PEA-LUT 700mg\u00d72/day. Cognitive effects were assessed by Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Mini-Mental State Examination, Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), Screening for Aphasia in Neurodegeneration, Activities of Daily Living-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, and Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration-modified Clinical Dementia Rating scale. To investigate in vivo neurophysiological effects of PEA-LUT, we used repetitive and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols assessing LTP-like cortical plasticity, short-interval intracortical inhibition, long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI), and short-latency afferent inhibition. Moreover, we used TMS combined with EEG to evaluate the effects on frontal lobe cortical oscillatory activity. Results: Treatment with PEA-LUT was associated with an improvement in NPI and FAB scores. Neurophysiological evaluation showed a restoration of LICI, in particular at ISI 100ms, suggesting a modulation of GABA(B) activity. TMS-EEG showed a remarkable increase of TMS-evoked frontal lobe activity and of high-frequency oscillations in the beta/gamma range. Conclusion: PEA-LUT could reduce behavioral disturbances and improve frontal lobe functions in FTD patients through the modulation of cortical oscillatory activity and GABA(B)ergic transmission.", "AuthorKeywords": ["behavioral symptoms", "Brain inflammation", "EEG", "executive functions", "frontotemporal dementia", "GABA activity", "transcranial magnetic stimulation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089922320", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57205577218": {"Name": "Assogna M.", "AuthorID": "57205577218", "AffiliationID": "60005075", "AffiliationName": "Tor Vergata Policlinic"}, "55613454600": {"Name": "Casula E.P.", "AuthorID": "55613454600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, University College"}, "57218654046": {"Name": "Borghi I.", "AuthorID": "57218654046", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "Santa Lucia Foundation, Irccs"}, "26533986400": {"Name": "Bonn\u00ec S.", "AuthorID": "26533986400", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "Santa Lucia Foundation, Irccs"}, "36461399500": {"Name": "Motta C.", "AuthorID": "36461399500", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "Santa Lucia Foundation, Irccs"}, "6603888625": {"Name": "Di Lorenzo F.", "AuthorID": "6603888625", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "Santa Lucia Foundation, Irccs"}, "57211785698": {"Name": "D'Acunto A.", "AuthorID": "57211785698", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "Santa Lucia Foundation, Irccs"}, "57211781866": {"Name": "Porrazzini F.", "AuthorID": "57211781866", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "Santa Lucia Foundation, Irccs"}, "57218654201": {"Name": "Minei M.", "AuthorID": "57218654201", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "Santa Lucia Foundation, Irccs"}, "57215514897": {"Name": "Caltagirone C.", "AuthorID": "57215514897", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "Santa Lucia Foundation, Irccs"}, "36866518200": {"Name": "Koch G.", "AuthorID": "36866518200", "AffiliationID": "60134846", "AffiliationName": "ECampus University"}, "57193964342": {"Name": "Sam\u00e0 D.", "AuthorID": "57193964342", "AffiliationID": "60005075", "AffiliationName": "Tor Vergata Policlinic"}, "7005822633": {"Name": "Martorana A.", "AuthorID": "7005822633", "AffiliationID": "60005075", "AffiliationName": "Tor Vergata Policlinic"}, "6701548417": {"Name": "Bozzali M.", "AuthorID": "6701548417", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
