Multiple models, including analytical, numerical, and statistical descriptions, have been made to understand and predict dielectric behavior. Analytical models are often limited to a particular type of compound, whereas machine learning (ML) models often lack interpretability. Here, we combine supervised ML, density functional perturbation theory, and analysis based on game theory to predict and explain the physical trends in optical dielectric constants of crystals. Two ML models, support vector regression and deep neural networks, were trained on a dataset of 1364 dielectric constants. Analysis of Shapley additive explanations of the ML models reveals that they recover correlations described by textbook Clausius-Mossotti and Penn models, which gives confidence in their ability to describe physical behavior, while providing superior predictive power.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Density functional perturbation theory", "Dielectric behavior", "Electromagnetic response", "Fundamental properties", "Optical dielectric constant", "Physical behaviors", "Relative permittivity", "Statistical descriptions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088158134", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57195334841": {"Name": "Morita K.", "AuthorID": "57195334841", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Imperial College London"}, "35315151400": {"Name": "Walsh A.", "AuthorID": "35315151400", "AffiliationID": "60016912", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Yonsei University"}, "57192819463": {"Name": "Davies D.W.", "AuthorID": "57192819463", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55423351000": {"Name": "Butler K.T.", "AuthorID": "55423351000", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "SciML, Scientific Computer Division, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}}}
