However, detailed information on bark absorption is currently very scarce. Therefore, laboratory experiments were conducted with an impedance tube to measure the bark's sound absorption of various tree species, including characterizations of bark thickness, roughness, tree age and moss coverage. Preliminary measurements were made to come to a reproducible sample handling procedure. The measurements show that the absorption (at normal incidence) is generally below 0.1 for the species considered and rather frequency independent below 1 kHz. There are statistically significant differences in the averaged absorption between species. Overall, the barks of conifers absorb sound slightly better than in case of broadleaved species. The most relevant visual predictor for the sound absorption of bark is its roughness. Interestingly, moss grown barks provide a strong increase in absorption in the frequency range up to 800 Hz. Especially in dense tree belts, bark absorption might have an influence on the final noise shielding performance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Impedance tube", "Natural means for noise abatement", "Sound absorption", "Tree bark"], "IndexKeywords": ["Impedance tubes", "Laboratory experiments", "Natural means", "Shielding performance", "Sound absorption", "Sound pressure level reductions", "Statistically significant difference", "Tree barks"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082174075", "SubjectAreas": [["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"]], "AuthorData": {"57215063467": {"Name": "Li M.", "AuthorID": "57215063467", "AffiliationID": "60019616", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, Harbin Institute of Technology, Key Laboratory of Cold Region Urban and Rural Human Settlement Environment Science and Technology, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology"}, "55485135500": {"Name": "Kang J.", "AuthorID": "55485135500", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering, The Bartlett"}, "12242552400": {"Name": "Van Renterghem T.", "AuthorID": "12242552400", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Ghent University, Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, Department of Information Technology, WAVES Research Group"}, "6701666696": {"Name": "Botteldooren D.", "AuthorID": "6701666696", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Ghent University, Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, Department of Information Technology, WAVES Research Group"}, "55158044500": {"Name": "Verheyen K.", "AuthorID": "55158044500", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Ghent University, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Department of Forest and Water Management, Forest and Nature Lab"}}}
