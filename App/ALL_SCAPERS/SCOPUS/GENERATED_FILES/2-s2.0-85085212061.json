Variation of the material feed ratio combined with precise fabrication geometries offers a simple avenue to functional grading of the materials properties. The integration of nanomaterials into milli-scale particle feedstock offers a new modality of nanomaterials handling, mixing and processing. We use X-ray computed tomography to quantify the functional grading and magnetic hyperthermia experiments to illustrate the functionalisation of the 3D printed composites. The technique is general and can be applied to a wide variety of materials; it has immediate application for repairing cracks in asphalt roads to modulate their properties and improve the lifetime of the repair.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Additive Manufacturing", "Composite Materials", "Functional Materials", "Magnetic Materials", "Magnetic Nanoparticles", "Nanoparticles"], "IndexKeywords": ["Additive manufacture", "Asphalt roads", "Functional grading", "Functionalisation", "Functionally graded", "Magnetic hyperthermia", "Precise fabrications", "X-ray computed tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085212061", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"57155266600": {"Name": "Jackson R.J.", "AuthorID": "57155266600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Making, University College London"}, "55827028600": {"Name": "Miodownik M.", "AuthorID": "55827028600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Making, University College London"}, "55811675700": {"Name": "Patrick P.S.", "AuthorID": "55811675700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, University College London"}}}
