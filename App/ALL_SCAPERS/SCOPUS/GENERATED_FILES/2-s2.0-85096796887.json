However, existing hybrid semiconductor X-ray detectors display dark currents that are 1000\u201310 000\u00d7 higher than industrially relevant values of 1\u201310 pA mm\u22122. Herein, ultra-low dark currents of <10 pA mm\u22122, under electric fields as high as \u22484 V \u00b5m\u22121, for hybrid X-ray detectors consisting of bismuth oxide nanoparticles (for enhanced X-ray attenuation) incorporated into an organic bulk heterojunction consisting of p-type Poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) and n-type [6,6]-Phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) are reported. Such ultra-low dark currents are realized through the enrichment of the hole selective p-type organic semiconductor near the anode contact. The resulting detectors demonstrate broadband X-ray response including an exceptionally high sensitivity of \u22481.5 mC Gy\u22121 cm\u22122 and <6% variation in angular dependence response under 6 MV hard X-rays. The above characteristics in combination with excellent dose linearity, dose rate linearity, and reproducibility over a broad energy range enable these detectors to be developed for medical and industrial applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["charge transport", "electronic structures", "organic electronics", "photonics", "sensors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Angular dependence", "Direct conversion", "Organic bulk heterojunctions", "Organic-inorganic hybrid", "p-Type organic semiconductors", "Poly(3-hexylthiophene-2 ,5-diyl)", "Reproducibilities", "Semiconductor X-ray detectors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096796887", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57220070864": {"Name": "Nanayakkara M.P.A.", "AuthorID": "57220070864", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Technology Institute, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Surrey"}, "57192654170": {"Name": "Masteghin M.G.", "AuthorID": "57192654170", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Technology Institute, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Surrey"}, "57190378711": {"Name": "Thirimanne H.M.", "AuthorID": "57190378711", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Technology Institute, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Surrey"}, "36349379900": {"Name": "Jayawardena K.D.G.I.", "AuthorID": "36349379900", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Technology Institute, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Surrey"}, "7203043276": {"Name": "Silva S.R.P.", "AuthorID": "7203043276", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Technology Institute, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Surrey"}, "55123257900": {"Name": "Matja\u010di\u0107 L.", "AuthorID": "55123257900", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}, "55893090500": {"Name": "Wood S.", "AuthorID": "55893090500", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}, "57202739433": {"Name": "Richheimer F.", "AuthorID": "57202739433", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}, "7101992518": {"Name": "Castro F.A.", "AuthorID": "7101992518", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}, "56189782900": {"Name": "Jenatsch S.", "AuthorID": "56189782900", "AffiliationID": "60100869", "AffiliationName": "FLUXiM AG"}, "26642210100": {"Name": "Z\u00fcfle S.", "AuthorID": "26642210100", "AffiliationID": "60100869", "AffiliationName": "FLUXiM AG"}, "57208482239": {"Name": "Kilbride R.", "AuthorID": "57208482239", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Sheffield"}, "7003960922": {"Name": "Parnell A.J.", "AuthorID": "7003960922", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Sheffield"}, "7005065727": {"Name": "Nisbet A.", "AuthorID": "7005065727", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
