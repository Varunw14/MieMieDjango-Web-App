We aimed to determine the long-term performance of the Riata 1580 leads compared with Endotak 0158 leads. Methods: All patients with Riata 1580 or Endotak 0158 leads implanted from 2003 to 2008 at the Heart Hospital, UCLH were analyzed. Significant electrical changes were as follows: threshold increase >1 V at a set pulse width between pacing checks, persistent R wave fall to <2 mV or reduction in R wave >50%, noise, pacing impedance change to <300 \u03a9 or >1500 \u03a9, high voltage (HV) change to <20 \u03a9 or >200 \u03a9, HV change \u00b1 15 \u03a9, pacing impedance change >400 \u03a9 over 12 months. Results: 333 Riata and 356 Endotak leads were implanted. Median follow-up time + interquartile range were calculated, after exclusion of censored events including loss to follow-up: Riata 3652 + 655 days, Endotak 3730 + 810 days. A total of 51 (15.9%) Riata leads and 21 (6.3%) Endotak leads were affected. A greater risk of failure was found for the Riata lead compared with the Endotak lead (P =.0001). An additional time-dependent effect was found, with the Riata lead 1.9 times more likely to fail in the first 6 years following lead implantation and 5.3 times more likely to fail after 6 years. Conclusions: Riata leads have a higher risk of failure compared to Endotak leads over time. The importance of careful ongoing performance surveillance late in the leads\u2019 lifetime is reflected in this 10-year follow-up study.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Endotak", "ICD", "lead failure", "lead performance", "Riata"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086511535", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"55621612900": {"Name": "Cobb V.", "AuthorID": "55621612900", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "The Heart Hospital, University College London Hospital"}, "14043109300": {"Name": "Ezzat V.", "AuthorID": "14043109300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "The Heart Hospital, University College London Hospital"}, "57217156652": {"Name": "Higgins F.", "AuthorID": "57217156652", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "The Heart Hospital, University College London Hospital"}, "6603130488": {"Name": "Lambiase P.", "AuthorID": "6603130488", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "The Heart Hospital, University College London Hospital"}, "7202196645": {"Name": "Lowe M.", "AuthorID": "7202196645", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "The Heart Hospital, University College London Hospital"}, "7004204877": {"Name": "Segal O.", "AuthorID": "7004204877", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "The Heart Hospital, University College London Hospital"}, "57200949630": {"Name": "Chow A.", "AuthorID": "57200949630", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "The Heart Hospital, University College London Hospital"}}}
