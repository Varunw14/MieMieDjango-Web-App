The role of African predominant SLCO1B1 variant alleles on rifampicin pharmacokinetics and the subsequent effect on the occurrence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-rifampicin sensitivity needs to be defined. We describe the rifampicin population pharmacokinetics profile and investigate the relevance of SLCO1B1 genotypes to rifampicin pharmacokinetics and rifampicin-TB sensitivity status. Methods: Fifty patients with TB (n=25 with rifampicin-resistant TB and n=25 with rifampicin-susceptible TB) were genotyped for SLOC1B1 rs4149032 (g.38664C>T), SLOC1B1\u22171B (c.388A>G) and SLOC1B1\u22175 (c.521 T>C). Steady state plasma rifampicin levels were determined among patients infected with rifampicin-sensitive TB. Data were analysed using NONMEM to estimate population rifampicin pharmacokinetics as well as the effect of SLOC1B1 genotypes on rifampicin pharmacokinetics and on rifampicin-TB sensitivity status. Results: Overall allele frequencies of SLOC1B1 rs4149032, \u22171B and \u22175 were 0.66, 0.90 and 0.01, respectively. Median (IQR) Cmax and Tmax were 10.2 (8.1-12.5) mg/L and 1.7 (1.125-2.218) h, respectively. Twenty-four percent of patients exhibited Cmax below the recommended 8-24 mg/L range. SLOC1B1 genotypes, gender and age did not influence rifampicin pharmacokinetics or TB-rifampicin sensitivity. Conclusions: Although SLOC1B1 genotype, age and gender do not influence either rifampicin pharmacokinetics or rifampicin-TB sensitivity status, one in every four Ugandan TB patients achieve subtherapeutic plasma rifampicin concentrations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["multidrug-resistant TB", "pharmacokinetics", "rifampicin", "SLCO1B1 polymorphism", "sub-Saharan Africa", "treatment outcomes"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082025430", "SubjectAreas": [["Parasitology", "IMMU", "2405"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"26536486300": {"Name": "Mukonzo J.K.", "AuthorID": "26536486300", "AffiliationID": "60071676", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Makerere University"}, "57215831846": {"Name": "Kengo A.", "AuthorID": "57215831846", "AffiliationID": "60071676", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Makerere University"}, "57215833772": {"Name": "Kutesa B.", "AuthorID": "57215833772", "AffiliationID": "60071676", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Makerere University"}, "36864495000": {"Name": "Nanzigu S.", "AuthorID": "36864495000", "AffiliationID": "60071676", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Makerere University"}, "8876890900": {"Name": "Pohanka A.", "AuthorID": "8876890900", "AffiliationID": "60019295, 60012311", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital-Huddinge"}, "57215032864": {"Name": "Aklillu E.", "AuthorID": "57215032864", "AffiliationID": "60019295, 60012311", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital-Huddinge"}, "7007165041": {"Name": "McHugh T.D.", "AuthorID": "7007165041", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Center for Clinical Microbiology, Division of Infection and Immunology, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57216109256": {"Name": "Zumla A.", "AuthorID": "57216109256", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Center, UCL Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
