However, the reasons are not completely understood, and the debate has focused on two hypotheses: a surgical effect or an acute STN-DBS effect. Methods: We recruited 3 PD samples: (1) a group assessed before and after STN-DBS surgery (2) a group assessed On vs. Off STN-DBS and (3) an unoperated PD control group. All groups performed letter, category and switching category VF tasks. The total number of correct words generated were noted and measures of clustering and switching were also obtained. Results: We found a significant effect of STN-DBS surgery on all VF tasks which was associated with a post-operative decline in the total number of words generated, and a reduction of phonemic switching during the letter and category VF tasks, and a reduction of semantic clustering for category VF. By contrast to the effects of surgery, acute On vs. Off stimulation did not influence the number of words generated on any of the VF tasks. Acute stimulation only produced two effects on the category VF task: increased semantic cluster size and decreased number of semantic switches when STN-DBS was switched On. Conclusions: This study differentiates between the effects of STN-DBS surgery and acute stimulation on VF performance. Our findings indicate that the STN-DBS effect on VF are a surgical and not an acute STN stimulation effect.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cognition", "Deep brain stimulation", "Stimulation", "Subthalamic nucleus", "Surgery", "Verbal fluency"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084067165", "SubjectAreas": [["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"57201910573": {"Name": "Leimbach F.", "AuthorID": "57201910573", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, and the National Hospital for Neurology & Neurosurgery"}, "7103040711": {"Name": "Wilkinson L.", "AuthorID": "7103040711", "AffiliationID": "60013780", "AffiliationName": "Behavioral Neurology Unit, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"}, "57216610493": {"Name": "Cheung C.", "AuthorID": "57216610493", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, and the National Hospital for Neurology & Neurosurgery"}, "7006891841": {"Name": "Jahanshahi M.", "AuthorID": "7006891841", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "The Clinical Hospital of Chengdu Brain Science Institute, MOE Key Lab for Neuroinformation, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"}, "57189071142": {"Name": "Atkinson-Clement C.", "AuthorID": "57189071142", "AffiliationID": "60120341", "AffiliationName": "Brain and Spine Institute (ICM), Movement Investigation and Therapeutics Team"}}}
