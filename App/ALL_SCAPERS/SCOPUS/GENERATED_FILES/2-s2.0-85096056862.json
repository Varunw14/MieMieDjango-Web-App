Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) are new marine intelligent platforms that can autonomously operate in various ocean environments with intelligent decision-making capability. As one of key technologies enabling such a capability, path planning algorithms underpin the navigation and motion control of USVs by providing optimized navigational trajectories. To accommodate complex maritime environments that include various static/moving obstacles, it is important to develop a computational efficient path planning algorithm for USVs so that real-time operation can be effectively carried out. This paper therefore proposes a new algorithm based on the fast sweeping method, named the locking sweeping method (LSM). Compared with other conventional path planning algorithms, the proposed LSM has an improved computational efficiency and can be well applied in dynamic environments that have multiple moving obstacles. When generating an optimal collision-free path, moving obstacles are modelled with ship domains that are calculated based upon ships\u2019 velocities. To evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithm, particularly the capacity in dealing with practical environments, three different sets of simulations were undertaken in environments built using electronic nautical charts (ENCs). Results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively cope with complex maritime traffic scenarios by generating smooth and safe trajectories.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electronic nautical charts (ENCs)", "Locking sweeping method", "Path planning", "Ship domain", "USVs"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096056862", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"], ["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"]], "AuthorData": {"36645502700": {"Name": "Zhuang J.", "AuthorID": "36645502700", "AffiliationID": "60003353", "AffiliationName": "Science and Technology on Underwater Vehicle Laboratory, Harbin Engineering University"}, "57211744321": {"Name": "Luo J.", "AuthorID": "57211744321", "AffiliationID": "60003353", "AffiliationName": "Science and Technology on Underwater Vehicle Laboratory, Harbin Engineering University"}, "56515441900": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "56515441900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
