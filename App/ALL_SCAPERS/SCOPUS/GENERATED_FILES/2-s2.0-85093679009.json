One of the algorithms incorporates the complete soft and collinear structure associated with photon emission, but may be computationally expensive, while the other approximates the soft structure at a lower cost. Radiation from fermions and W bosons is included, and a strategy for photon radiation off leptons below the hadronization scale is set up. We show results of the application of the shower algorithms to Drell-Yan and W+W\u2212 production at the LHC, showing the impact of the inclusion of the full soft structure and treatment of radiation off W bosons.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hadron Collisions", "Parton Showers", "Quantum Electrodynamics"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85093679009", "SubjectAreas": [["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"]], "AuthorData": {"14827231400": {"Name": "Skands P.", "AuthorID": "14827231400", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics & Astronomy, Monash University"}, "55754789500": {"Name": "Verheyen R.", "AuthorID": "55754789500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
