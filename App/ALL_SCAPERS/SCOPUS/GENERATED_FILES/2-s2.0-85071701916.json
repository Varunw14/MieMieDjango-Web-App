Methods: Intra- and inter-observer variability rates and sensitivity were tested, before and after additional training, by two research fellows with a prior basic training in obstetric ultrasound using digitally recorded second-trimester ultrasound images from cases of anterior placenta previa with and without PAS. Results: Fifty-two cases of anterior placenta previa with PAS (n=26) and without PAS (n=26) were included in the study. The highest level of inter-observer agreement for ultrasound signs was found for the absence of placental bulge and/or focal exophytic mass on gray-scale imaging and the absence of subplacental hypervascularity, bridging vessels and lacunar feeder vessels on color Doppler imaging. The level of inter-observer agreement increased from 39% before training to 40% after training; the numbers agreed as PAS by both trainees increased from four to 20. No cases were classified as inconclusive after training. There was a significant (P<0.001) change in sensitivity for both trainees after training. Conclusion: Additional training in detecting the ultrasound signs associated with PAS using a standardized protocol improves the diagnostic accuracy of operators with only a basic obstetric ultrasound training.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Placenta accreta", "Placenta increta", "Placenta percreta", "Prenatal diagnosis", "Training", "Ultrasound"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Female", "Humans", "Mass Screening", "Observer Variation", "Obstetrics", "Placenta Accreta", "Placenta Previa", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Trimester, Second", "Program Evaluation", "Ultrasonography, Prenatal"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071701916", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"57210852822": {"Name": "Dimitrova I.", "AuthorID": "57210852822", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "The Fetal Medicine Research Institute, Kings College Hospital, Harris Birthright Research Centre"}, "6602342386": {"Name": "Zosmer N.", "AuthorID": "6602342386", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "The Fetal Medicine Research Institute, Kings College Hospital, Harris Birthright Research Centre"}, "6505724426": {"Name": "De Stefani L.B.", "AuthorID": "6505724426", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "The Fetal Medicine Research Institute, Kings College Hospital, Harris Birthright Research Centre"}, "57201898567": {"Name": "Andrade W.", "AuthorID": "57201898567", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "The Fetal Medicine Research Institute, Kings College Hospital, Harris Birthright Research Centre"}, "6505520960": {"Name": "Nicholaides K.H.", "AuthorID": "6505520960", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "The Fetal Medicine Research Institute, Kings College Hospital, Harris Birthright Research Centre"}, "57203176734": {"Name": "Jauniaux E.", "AuthorID": "57203176734", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EGA Institute for Women's Health, Faculty of Population Health Sciences, University College London (UCL)"}, "57209177319": {"Name": "Bourmpaki E.", "AuthorID": "57209177319", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "School of Population Health and Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, Kings College London"}, "7005268305": {"Name": "Bunce C.", "AuthorID": "7005268305", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "School of Population Health and Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, Kings College London"}}}
