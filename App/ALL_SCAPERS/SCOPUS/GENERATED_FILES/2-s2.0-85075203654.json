Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of International Society on Thrombosis and HaemostasisBackground: The current standard of care for patients with hemophilia A is regular prophylaxis with factor VIII (FVIII) administered intravenously. Interest in subcutaneous (s.c.) administration, to potentially increase convenience, reduce the treatment burden and improve compliance, is increasing. Objectives: Evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, safety, and preliminary efficacy of s.c. administration of turoctocog alfa pegol (s.c. N8-GP) in adult or adolescent previously treated patients (PTPs) with severe hemophilia A (alleviate 1; NCT02994407). Patients/Methods: In part A, 24 PTPs received a single dose of s.c. N8-GP (12.5, 25, 50, or 100 IU/kg) with 6 patients per cohort. PK modelling of data from part A supported a suitable dose for part B. Part B comprised a multiple dose trial in 26 PTPs; patients <60 kg received 2000 IU and patients \u226560 kg received 4000 IU s.c. N8-GP daily for 3 months. Results: Single-dose s.c. N8-GP supported dose linearity. Daily prophylaxis with s.c. N8-GP appeared well tolerated and efficacious, achieving a mean trough FVIII activity close to 10% at steady state. Five patients developed anti-N8-GP binding antibodies after 42 to 91 exposure days, one of whom developed an inhibitor to FVIII. Anti-N8-GP antibody appearance was associated with a decline in FVIII plasma activity in four of the five patients. Five patients reported a total of nine treatment-requiring bleeding episodes during prophylaxis. Conclusions: Subcutaneous administration of N8-GP is associated with a high incidence of antibodies in PTPs with severe hemophilia A. Further clinical development of s.c. N8-GP has been suspended.", "AuthorKeywords": ["antibodies", "factor VIII", "hemophilia A", "subcutaneous infusions"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075203654", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"14067377900": {"Name": "Klamroth R.", "AuthorID": "14067377900", "AffiliationID": "60075679", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Hemophilia Treatment Centre, Vivantes Klinikum im Friedrichshain"}, "6603401668": {"Name": "Feistritzer C.", "AuthorID": "6603401668", "AffiliationID": "60008222", "AffiliationName": "Internal Medicine V\u2014Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Innsbruck"}, "7004821610": {"Name": "Friedrich U.", "AuthorID": "7004821610", "AffiliationID": "60006179", "AffiliationName": "Novo Nordisk"}, "56034804500": {"Name": "Zak M.", "AuthorID": "56034804500", "AffiliationID": "60006179", "AffiliationName": "Novo Nordisk"}, "57209010337": {"Name": "Lentz S.R.", "AuthorID": "57209010337", "AffiliationID": "60009788", "AffiliationName": "The University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine"}, "57211868231": {"Name": "Reichwald K.", "AuthorID": "57211868231", "AffiliationID": "60006179", "AffiliationName": "Novo Nordisk"}, "57193134405": {"Name": "Chowdary P.", "AuthorID": "57193134405", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "KD Haemophilia and Thrombosis Centre, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
