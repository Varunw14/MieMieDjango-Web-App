In response to this, we have undertaken research to explore how a programme of GIS training, integrated within a two-year A-Level examination course, develops students\u2019 perceptions of the value and nature of GIS, their subsequent engagement with it, and its impact on their geographical knowledge. This paper reports on one strand of the longitudinal research which focuses on how tapping into the expertise of real-world, industry experts can affect students\u2019 perceptions of the relevance of GIS to geography and support their acquisition of geographical knowledge. The project, an interpretive case study, used questionnaires, interviews and analysis of students\u2019 work to elicit students\u2019 developing perceptions of and engagement with GIS, as well as changes in their geographical knowledge. Results suggest that engagement with industry experts aids students\u2019 understanding of what GIS is, allowing them to develop a more nuanced appreciation of its real-world applications; this then appears to play both a direct and indirect role in the subsequent development of students\u2019 geographical knowledge.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Geographical information systems (GIS)", "geographical knowledge", "geography education", "industry experts", "student perceptions", "WebGIS"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073773012", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"57211403520": {"Name": "Healy G.", "AuthorID": "57211403520", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "55892907700": {"Name": "Walshe N.", "AuthorID": "55892907700", "AffiliationID": "60000913", "AffiliationName": "School of Education and Social Care, Anglia Ruskin University"}}}
