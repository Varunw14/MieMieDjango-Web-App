The most recent experiment (CASP13 held in 2018) saw dramatic progress in structure modeling without use of structural templates (historically \u201cab initio\u201d modeling). Progress was driven by the successful application of deep learning techniques to predict inter-residue distances. In turn, these results drove dramatic improvements in three-dimensional structure accuracy: With the proviso that there are an adequate number of sequences known for the protein family, the new methods essentially solve the long-standing problem of predicting the fold topology of monomeric proteins. Further, the number of sequences required in the alignment has fallen substantially. There is also substantial improvement in the accuracy of template-based models. Other areas\u2014model refinement, accuracy estimation, and the structure of protein assemblies\u2014have again yielded interesting results. CASP13 placed increased emphasis on the use of sparse data together with modeling and chemical crosslinking, SAXS, and NMR all yielded more mature results. This paper summarizes the key outcomes of CASP13. The special issue of PROTEINS contains papers describing the CASP13 assessments in each modeling category and contributions from the participants.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CASP", "community wide experiment", "protein structure prediction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Computational Biology", "Humans", "Models, Molecular", "Protein Conformation", "Proteins", "Scattering, Small Angle", "X-Ray Diffraction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074301420", "SubjectAreas": [["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"55887853100": {"Name": "Kryshtafovych A.", "AuthorID": "55887853100", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "Genome Center, University of California, Davis"}, "6603754633": {"Name": "Fidelis K.", "AuthorID": "6603754633", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "Genome Center, University of California, Davis"}, "6603125836": {"Name": "Schwede T.", "AuthorID": "6603125836", "AffiliationID": "60023588, 60026285", "AffiliationName": "Biozentrum & SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, University of Basel"}, "7006421825": {"Name": "Topf M.", "AuthorID": "7006421825", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "57203645949": {"Name": "Moult J.", "AuthorID": "57203645949", "AffiliationID": "60020304", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics, University of Maryland"}}}
