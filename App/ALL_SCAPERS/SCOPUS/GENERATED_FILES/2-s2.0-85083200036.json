A greater understanding of these challenges could inform the development of effective interventions. Aim: To investigate the barriers and facilitators experienced by patients, carers and healthcare professionals managing symptoms in infants, children and young people at end of life. Design: A mixed-methods systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken (PROSPERO ID: CRD42019124797). Data sources: The Cochrane Library, PROSPERO, CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science Core Collection, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Database, Evidence Search and OpenGrey were electronically searched from the inception of each database for qualitative, quantitative or mixed-methods studies that included data from patients, carers or healthcare professionals referring to barriers or facilitators to paediatric end-of-life symptom management. Studies underwent data extraction, quality appraisal, narrative thematic synthesis and meta-analysis. Results: A total of 64 studies were included (32 quantitative, 18 qualitative and 14 mixed-methods) of medium-low quality. Themes were generated encompassing barriers/facilitators experienced by carers (treatment efficacy, treatment side effects, healthcare professionals\u2019 attitudes, hospice care, home care, families\u2019 symptom management strategies) and healthcare professionals (medicine access, treatment efficacy, healthcare professionals\u2019 demographics, treatment side effects, specialist support, healthcare professionals\u2019 training, health services delivery, home care). Only one study included patients\u2019 views. Conclusion: There is a need for effective communication between healthcare professionals and families, more training for healthcare professionals, improved symptom management planning including anticipatory prescribing, and urgent attention paid to the patients\u2019 perspective.", "AuthorKeywords": ["caregivers", "Child", "meta-analysis", "paediatrics", "pain management", "palliative care", "systematic review", "terminal care"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083200036", "SubjectAreas": [["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"55176000600": {"Name": "Greenfield K.", "AuthorID": "55176000600", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Southampton"}, "35750031500": {"Name": "Holley S.", "AuthorID": "35750031500", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Southampton"}, "35312296200": {"Name": "Schoth D.E.", "AuthorID": "35312296200", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Southampton"}, "6602683528": {"Name": "Liossi C.", "AuthorID": "6602683528", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Psychological Medicine, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6508240687": {"Name": "Harrop E.", "AuthorID": "6508240687", "AffiliationID": "60008323, 60170323", "AffiliationName": "John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7403674211": {"Name": "Howard R.F.", "AuthorID": "7403674211", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia and Pain Medicine, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004464603": {"Name": "Bayliss J.", "AuthorID": "7004464603", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "The Louis Dundas Centre, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35232656000": {"Name": "Brook L.", "AuthorID": "35232656000", "AffiliationID": "60024418", "AffiliationName": "Alder Hey Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "57206312449": {"Name": "Jassal S.S.", "AuthorID": "57206312449", "AffiliationID": "124234675", "AffiliationName": "Rainbows Hospice"}, "56897824000": {"Name": "Johnson M.", "AuthorID": "56897824000", "AffiliationID": "118416506", "AffiliationName": "Patient Public Representative"}, "7102513915": {"Name": "Wong I.", "AuthorID": "7102513915", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}}}
