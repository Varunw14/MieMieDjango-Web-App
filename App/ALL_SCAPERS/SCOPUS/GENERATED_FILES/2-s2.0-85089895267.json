The Authors.Chemical weathering of volcanic rocks in warm and humid climates contributes disproportionately to global solute fluxes. Geochemical signatures of solutes and solids formed during this process can help quantify and reconstruct weathering intensity in the past. Here, we measured silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge) isotope ratios of the soils, clays, and fluids from a tropical lowland rainforest in Costa Rica. The bulk topsoil is intensely weathered and isotopically light (mean \u00b1 1\u03c3: \u03b430Si = \u22122.1 \u00b1 0.3\u2030, \u03b474Ge = \u22120.13 \u00b1 0.12\u2030) compared to the parent rock (\u03b430Si = \u22120.11 \u00b1 0.05\u2030, \u03b474Ge = 0.59 \u00b1 0.07\u2030). Neoforming clays have even lower values (\u03b430Si = \u22122.5 \u00b1 0.2\u2030, \u03b474Ge = \u22120.16 \u00b1 0.09\u2030), demonstrating a whole-system isotopic shift in extremely weathered systems. The lowland streams represent mixing of dilute local fluids (\u03b430Si = 0.2 \u2212 0.6\u2030, \u03b474Ge = 2.2 \u2212 2.6\u2030) with solute-rich interbasin groundwater (\u03b430Si = 1.0 \u00b1 0.2\u2030, \u03b474Ge = 4.0\u2030). Using a Ge-Si isotope mass balance model, we calculate that 91 \u00b1 9% of Ge released via weathering of lowland soils is sequestered by neoforming clays, 9 \u00b1 9% by vegetation, and only 0.2 \u00b1 0.2% remains dissolved. Vegetation plays an important role in the Si cycle, directly sequestering 39 \u00b1 14% of released Si and enhancing clay neoformation in surface soils via the addition of amorphous phytolith silica. Globally, volcanic soil \u03b474Ge closely tracks the depletion of Ge by chemical weathering (\u03c4Ge), whereas \u03b430Si and Ge/Si both reflect the loss of Si (\u03c4Si). Because of the different chemical mobilities of Ge and Si, a \u03b474Ge-\u03b430Si multiproxy system is sensitive to a wider range of weathering intensities than each isotopic system in isolation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089895267", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"]], "AuthorData": {"56910616600": {"Name": "Baronas J.J.", "AuthorID": "56910616600", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University of Cambridge"}, "26538380300": {"Name": "West A.J.", "AuthorID": "26538380300", "AffiliationID": "60029311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University of Southern California"}, "7202006685": {"Name": "Hammond D.E.", "AuthorID": "7202006685", "AffiliationID": "60029311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University of Southern California"}, "7102621928": {"Name": "Burton K.W.", "AuthorID": "7102621928", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Durham University"}, "12139942000": {"Name": "Opfergelt S.", "AuthorID": "12139942000", "AffiliationID": "60000874", "AffiliationName": "Earth and Life Institute, Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain"}, "57204707349": {"Name": "Pogge von Strandmann P.A.E.", "AuthorID": "57204707349", "AffiliationID": "60009016, 60162131, 60162128, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "London Geochemistry and Isotope Centre (LOGIC), Institute of Earth and Planetary Sciences, University College London and Birkbeck, University of London"}, "7401669603": {"Name": "James R.H.", "AuthorID": "7401669603", "AffiliationID": "60025225, 60010934", "AffiliationName": "School of Ocean and Earth Science, National Oceanography Centre Southampton, University of Southampton Waterfront Campus"}, "6507604429": {"Name": "Rouxel O.J.", "AuthorID": "6507604429", "AffiliationID": "60019839", "AffiliationName": "IFREMER, Centre de Brest, Unit\u00e9 G\u00e9osciences Marines"}}}
