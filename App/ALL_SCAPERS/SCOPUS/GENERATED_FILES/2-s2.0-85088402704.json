All rights reserved.Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy is a valuable tool for examining the structures of proteins. It can provide information on protein secondary, tertiary, and higher order structure (HOS), the last of which is particularly important for characterizing proteins for biopharmaceutical applications. This chapter describes the basic principles underlying CD spectroscopy, good practice methods for measuring and interpreting CD data, and tools and resources for processing, comparing, analyzing, validating and displaying spectra.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bench-top instrument", "Biosimilars", "Calibration methods", "Calibration standards", "Circular dichroism (CD)", "Data analysis", "Data collection protocols", "Data processing", "Data validation", "Glyosylation", "Instrument settings", "Instrumentation", "Log keeping", "Optical activity", "Optical cell calibrations", "Optical cells", "Protein circular dichroism data bank (PCDDB)", "Protein folding", "Record keeping", "Secondary structure analyses", "Software", "Synchrotron radiation circular dichroism (SRCD)", "Troubleshooting", "Websites", "You-tube informational videos"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088402704", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"], ["Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)", "PHAR", "3000"]], "AuthorData": {"24605487500": {"Name": "Miles A.J.", "AuthorID": "24605487500", "AffiliationID": "60009016, 60033387", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "7202576274": {"Name": "Wallace B.A.", "AuthorID": "7202576274", "AffiliationID": "60009016, 60033387", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London"}}}
