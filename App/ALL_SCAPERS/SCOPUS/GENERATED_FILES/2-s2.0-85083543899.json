We have identified an accurate and reliable computational method to characterize the strength and chemical nature of the interhelical interactions between the residues of transmembrane (TM) domains during different receptor activation states, something that cannot be characterized solely by visual inspection of structural information. Using the fragment molecular orbital (FMO) quantum mechanics method to analyze 35 crystal structures representing different branches of the class A GPCR family, we have identified 69 topologically equivalent TM residues that form a consensus network of 51 inter-TM interactions, providing novel results that are consistent with and help to rationalize experimental data. This discovery establishes a comprehensive picture of how defined molecular forces govern specific interhelical interactions which, in turn, support the structural stability, ligand binding, and activation of GPCRs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Ligands", "Protein Binding", "Protein Conformation", "Quantum Theory", "Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083543899", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"7003508743": {"Name": "Heifetz A.", "AuthorID": "7003508743", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Research Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "6603296449": {"Name": "Morao I.", "AuthorID": "6603296449", "AffiliationID": "60102134", "AffiliationName": "Evotec (U.K.) Ltd."}, "57189468988": {"Name": "James T.", "AuthorID": "57189468988", "AffiliationID": "60102134", "AffiliationName": "Evotec (U.K.) Ltd."}, "56005887100": {"Name": "Southey M.W.Y.", "AuthorID": "56005887100", "AffiliationID": "60102134", "AffiliationName": "Evotec (U.K.) Ltd."}, "6602870623": {"Name": "Bodkin M.J.", "AuthorID": "6602870623", "AffiliationID": "60102134", "AffiliationName": "Evotec (U.K.) Ltd."}, "6701753724": {"Name": "Townsend-Nicholson A.", "AuthorID": "6701753724", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Research Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "57203195363": {"Name": "Babu M.M.", "AuthorID": "57203195363", "AffiliationID": "60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"}, "56842563500": {"Name": "Fedorov D.G.", "AuthorID": "56842563500", "AffiliationID": "60024621", "AffiliationName": "CD-FMat, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST)"}, "56121872000": {"Name": "Aldeghi M.", "AuthorID": "56121872000", "AffiliationID": "60032895", "AffiliationName": "Department of Theoretical and Computational Biophysics, Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry"}}}
