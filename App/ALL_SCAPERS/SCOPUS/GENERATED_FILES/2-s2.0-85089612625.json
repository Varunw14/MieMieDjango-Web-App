Methods to augment stem cell homing to tumours are being investigated with the goal of enhancing treatment efficacy. However, it is currently not possible to evaluate both cell localisation and cell viability after engraftment, hindering optimisation of therapy. In this study, luciferase-expressing human adipocyte-derived stem cells (ADSCs) were incubated with Indium-111 radiolabelled iron oxide nanoparticles to produce cells with tri-modal imaging capabilities. ADSCs were administered intravenously (IV) or intracardially (IC) to mice bearing orthotopic breast tumours. Cell fate was monitored using bioluminescence imaging (BLI) as a measure of cell viability, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for cell localisation and single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) for cell quantification. Serial monitoring with multi-modal imaging showed the presence of viable ADSCs within tumours as early as 1-hour post IC injection and the percentage of ADSCs within tumours to be 2-fold higher after IC than IV. Finally, histological analysis was used to validate engraftment of ADSC within tumour tissue. These findings demonstrate that multi-modal imaging can be used to evaluate the efficiency of stem cell delivery to tumours and that IC cell administration is more effective for tumour targeting.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-cancer agents", "Bioluminescence imaging", "Cell viability", "Histological analysis", "Imaging capabilities", "Iron oxide nanoparticle", "Multi-modal imaging", "Single photon emission computer tomographies", "Animals", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell Survival", "Cell Tracking", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Female", "Humans", "Indium Radioisotopes", "Luciferases", "Magnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles", "Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental", "Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation", "Mesenchymal Stem Cells", "Mice", "Multimodal Imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089612625", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57188734745": {"Name": "Zaw Thin M.", "AuthorID": "57188734745", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "55961871300": {"Name": "Connell J.J.", "AuthorID": "55961871300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "55811675700": {"Name": "Patrick P.S.", "AuthorID": "55811675700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "7004107686": {"Name": "Lythgoe M.F.", "AuthorID": "7004107686", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "14820025000": {"Name": "Stuckey D.J.", "AuthorID": "14820025000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "9434519300": {"Name": "Kalber T.L.", "AuthorID": "9434519300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "57211564453": {"Name": "Allan H.", "AuthorID": "57211564453", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "51664470800": {"Name": "Bofinger R.", "AuthorID": "51664470800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57218575848": {"Name": "Kostelec T.D.", "AuthorID": "57218575848", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57218571767": {"Name": "Guillaume S.", "AuthorID": "57218571767", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6603904305": {"Name": "Hailes H.C.", "AuthorID": "6603904305", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7005824166": {"Name": "Tabor A.B.", "AuthorID": "7005824166", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
