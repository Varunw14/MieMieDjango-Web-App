Methods: All patients who underwent revision shoulder arthroplasty for failed HHRH at our institution were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-two shoulders in 20 patients were available for analysis. Mean age at the time of HHRH was 60 years (range 42 years to 75 years). The cohort consisted of 17 females and three males. Results: The mean time from HHRH to revision was 5 years (range 1 year to 8 years). Mean age at the time of revision surgery was 62 years (range 44 years to 80 years). Patients were followed-up for a mean of 3.3 years (range 2 years to 4 years) after revision. Following revision surgery, there was an increase in forward elevation from 67\u00b0 (range 0\u00b0 to 130\u00b0) to 97\u00b0 (range 40\u00b0 to 160\u00b0) (p = 0.04). This was accompanied by an improvement in both the Oxford Shoulder Score and the subjective shoulder value, which increased from 13 (range 2 to 28) to 39 (range 24 to 48) (p = 0.000) and from 23 (range 0 to 65) to 79 (range 25 to 100) (p = 0.000) respectively. Conclusions: Revision shoulder arthroplasty for failed HHRH improves functional outcome.", "AuthorKeywords": ["hemiarthroplasty", "resurfacing", "revision surgery", "shoulder arthritis", "shoulder replacement", "total shoulder replacement"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075612624", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"], ["Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation", "HEAL", "3612"], ["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Rehabilitation", "MEDI", "2742"]], "AuthorData": {"24466832300": {"Name": "Thangarajah T.", "AuthorID": "24466832300", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "The Shoulder and Elbow Service, The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "7102307943": {"Name": "Higgs D.", "AuthorID": "7102307943", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "The Shoulder and Elbow Service, The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "6507112875": {"Name": "Falworth M.", "AuthorID": "6507112875", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "The Shoulder and Elbow Service, The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "57188743870": {"Name": "Ajami S.", "AuthorID": "57188743870", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "The John Scales Centre for Biomedical Engineering, Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London, The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "6603029220": {"Name": "Coathup M.", "AuthorID": "6603029220", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "The John Scales Centre for Biomedical Engineering, Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London, The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "57206307303": {"Name": "Blunn G.W.", "AuthorID": "57206307303", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "The John Scales Centre for Biomedical Engineering, Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London, The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "17635028100": {"Name": "Lambert S.", "AuthorID": "17635028100", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University College London Hospital"}}}
