MAFLD is more aggressive in lean patients compared to obese patients, with a higher risk of mortality. Specific biomarkers to diagnose differentially lean or overweight MAFLD are missing. Histones and nucleosomes are released in the bloodstream upon cell death. Here, we propose a new, fast, imaging and epigenetics based approach to investigate the severity of steatosis in lean MAFLD patients. Results: A total of 53 non-obese patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of MAFLD were recruited. Twenty patients displayed steatosis grade 1 (0-33%), 24 patients with steatosis grade 2 (34-66%) and 9 patients with steatosis grade 3 (67-100%). The levels of circulating nucleosomes were assayed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while individual histones or histone dimers were assayed in serum samples by means of a new advanced flow cytometry ImageStream(X)-adapted method. Circulating nucleosome levels associated poorly with MAFLD in the absence of obesity. We implemented successfully a multi-channel flow methodology on ImageStream(X), to image single histone staining (H2A, H2B, H3, H4, macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2). We report here a significant depletion of the levels of histone variants macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2 in the serum of lean MAFLD patients, either individually or in complex with H2B. Conclusions: In summary, we identified a new circulating histone signature able to discriminate the severity of steatosis in individuals with lean MAFLD, using a rapid and non-invasive ImageStream(X)-based imaging technology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Epigenetics", "Histones", "ImageStream", "Lean MAFLD", "Liquid biopsy", "Metabolic health"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089768842", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"57217356044": {"Name": "Buzova D.", "AuthorID": "57217356044", "AffiliationID": "60031135", "AffiliationName": "Department of Adaptive Biotechnologies, Global Change Research Institute Cas"}, "8654085200": {"Name": "Cerveny J.", "AuthorID": "8654085200", "AffiliationID": "60031135", "AffiliationName": "Department of Adaptive Biotechnologies, Global Change Research Institute Cas"}, "56740683100": {"Name": "Maugeri A.", "AuthorID": "56740683100", "AffiliationID": "60010146", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences and Advanced Technologies gf Ingrassia, University of Catania"}, "57191250914": {"Name": "Lo Re O.", "AuthorID": "57191250914", "AffiliationID": "60068899", "AffiliationName": "International Clinical Research Center, St Anne's University Hospital"}, "6603555514": {"Name": "Vinciguerra M.", "AuthorID": "6603555514", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "57195215966": {"Name": "Liguori A.", "AuthorID": "57195215966", "AffiliationID": "60073799", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterological, Endocrine-Metabolic and Nephro-Urological Sciences, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.
