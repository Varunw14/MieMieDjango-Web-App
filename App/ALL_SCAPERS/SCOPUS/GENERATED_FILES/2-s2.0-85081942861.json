Previous studies suggest that healthy adults possess an implicit mentalising system, but alternative explanations for data from reaction time false belief tasks have also been given. In this study, we combined signal detection theory (SDT) with a false belief task. As application of SDT allows us to separate perceptual sensitivity from criteria, we are able to investigate how another person\u2019s beliefs change the participant\u2019s perception of near-threshold stimuli. Participants (n = 55) watched four different videos in which an actor saw (or did not see) a Gabor cube hidden (or not hidden) behind an occluder. At the end of each video, the occluder vanished revealing a cube either with or without Gabor pattern, and participants needed to report whether they saw the Gabor pattern or not. A pre-registered analysis with classical statistics weakly suggests an effect of the actor\u2019s belief on participant\u2019s perceptions. An exploratory Bayesian analysis supports the idea that when the actor believed the cube was present, participants made slower and more liberal judgements. Although these data are not definitive, these current results indicate the value of new measures for understanding implicit false belief processing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bayesian hierarchical model", "false belief task", "signal detection theory", "Theory-of-mind"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Bayes Theorem", "Female", "Form Perception", "Humans", "Male", "Pattern Recognition, Visual", "Perceptual Masking", "Signal Detection, Psychological", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081942861", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"57215786165": {"Name": "Ye T.", "AuthorID": "57215786165", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60109771", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "38060964400": {"Name": "Hamilton A.F.D.C.", "AuthorID": "38060964400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60109771", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "35068005100": {"Name": "Fleming S.M.", "AuthorID": "35068005100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}}}
