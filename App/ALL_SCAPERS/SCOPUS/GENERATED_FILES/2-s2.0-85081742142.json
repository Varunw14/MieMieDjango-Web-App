Data were collected at baseline and 12 months follow-up from mother\u2013child dyads recruited as part of an ongoing trial in Zimbabwe. Symptoms of CMD were assessed using the Shona Symptom Questionnaire. Mixed-effects linear regression was used to assess child cognitive scores at follow-up (using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning) in relation to caregiver CMD prevalence over 12 months. At baseline, caregivers reporting CMD (n = 230; 40.1%) were less likely to have completed higher education (46.9% vs. 56.9%; p = 0.02), more likely to be unmarried (27.8% vs. 16.0%; p < 0.01), and experience food insecurity (50.0% vs. 29.4%; p < 0.01) compared to the group without CMD (n = 344). There were 4 CMD patterns over time: (i) Emerging CMD (n = 101; 19.7% of caregivers) defined as those who were below the cut-off at baseline, and above it at 12 months; (ii) Improving CMD (n = 76; 14.8%) defined as those who reported CMD at baseline, and were below the cut-off by follow-up; (iii) No CMD (n = 206; 40.1%) defined as those who did not report CMD symptoms at either time point; and (iv) Chronic CMD (n = 131; 25.5%) defined as those who reported CMD above the cut-off at both time points. Children of caregivers with chronic CMD (n = 131, 25.5%) had lower receptive language scores (aMD:\u22122.81, 95%CI \u22125.1 to \u22120.6; p = 0.05) compared to the reference group with no CMD (n = 206, 40.1%). Exposure to caregiver CMD over a prolonged period may affect child receptive vocabulary skills.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Child cognitive development", "Common mental disorders", "HIV positive", "Maternal depression", "Sub-Saharan Africa"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anti-HIV Agents", "Caregivers", "Child", "Child Development", "Cognition", "Cognition Disorders", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Language", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Mothers", "Prevalence", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Zimbabwe"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081742142", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57192162001": {"Name": "Mebrahtu H.", "AuthorID": "57192162001", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Global Health, University College London"}, "35847280700": {"Name": "Sherr L.", "AuthorID": "35847280700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Global Health, University College London"}, "24765744300": {"Name": "Simms V.", "AuthorID": "24765744300", "AffiliationID": "60031331, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Tropical Epidemiology Group, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7403112967": {"Name": "Weiss H.A.", "AuthorID": "7403112967", "AffiliationID": "60031331, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Tropical Epidemiology Group, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "36461698700": {"Name": "Rehman A.M.", "AuthorID": "36461698700", "AffiliationID": "60031331, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Tropical Epidemiology Group, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57202332756": {"Name": "Chingono R.", "AuthorID": "57202332756", "AffiliationID": "60138807", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Sexual Health HIV/AIDS Research (CeSHHAR)"}, "57202338576": {"Name": "Ndlovu P.", "AuthorID": "57202338576", "AffiliationID": "120789816", "AffiliationName": "World Education Inc./Bantwana (WEI/B)"}, "56432392100": {"Name": "Cowan F.M.", "AuthorID": "56432392100", "AffiliationID": "60020934", "AffiliationName": "Department of International Public Health, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"}}}
