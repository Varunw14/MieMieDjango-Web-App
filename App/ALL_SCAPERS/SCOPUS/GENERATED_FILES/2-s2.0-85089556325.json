Here we show that Hansenula polymorpha Inp1 associates peroxisomes to the plasma membrane. Peroxisome-plasma membrane contact sites disappear upon deletion of INP1 but increase upon INP1 overexpression. Analysis of truncated Inp1 variants showed that the C terminus is important for association to the peroxisome, while a stretch of conserved positive charges and a central pleckstrin homology-like domain are important for plasma membrane binding. In cells of a PEX3 deletion, strain Inp1-GFP localizes to the plasma membrane, concentrated in patches near the bud neck and in the cortex of nascent buds. Upon disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by treatment of the cells with latrunculin A, Inp1-GFP became cytosolic, indicating that Inp1 localization is dependent on the presence of an intact actin cytoskeleton.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089556325", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"7801324084": {"Name": "Krikken A.M.", "AuthorID": "7801324084", "AffiliationID": "60085410, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Cell Biology, Groningen Biomolecular Sciences and Biotechnology Institute, University of Groningen"}, "57203813036": {"Name": "Wu H.", "AuthorID": "57203813036", "AffiliationID": "60085410, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Cell Biology, Groningen Biomolecular Sciences and Biotechnology Institute, University of Groningen"}, "55189905500": {"Name": "de Boer R.", "AuthorID": "55189905500", "AffiliationID": "60085410, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Cell Biology, Groningen Biomolecular Sciences and Biotechnology Institute, University of Groningen"}, "7006821835": {"Name": "van der Klei I.J.", "AuthorID": "7006821835", "AffiliationID": "60085410, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Cell Biology, Groningen Biomolecular Sciences and Biotechnology Institute, University of Groningen"}, "7004062844": {"Name": "Devos D.P.", "AuthorID": "7004062844", "AffiliationID": "60030114, 60006754, 60103756", "AffiliationName": "Centro Andaluz de Biolog\u00eda del Desarrollo, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas, Pablo de Olavide University"}, "7102551297": {"Name": "Levine T.P.", "AuthorID": "7102551297", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}}}
