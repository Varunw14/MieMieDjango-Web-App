Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.This paper draws attention to the increasingly central yet understudied role of social media in facilitating student mobility from India. More specifically, it explores the emergence of online mutual-help communities of aspirant student migrants on Facebook and WhatsApp, which are aimed at helping members navigate the process of going abroad for study. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork focused on postgraduate-level student migration from India to Germany, the paper explores how these communities are meeting aspirant student migrants\u2019 information and support needs in novel ways. Not only are they a key space in which information on study in Germany is discussed, dissected, and interpreted, they have also resulted in the production of a whole new body of information, tools, and resources on how to navigate the process of going to Germany for a Master\u2019s degree. The paper argues that these communities can be seen as democratising access to study abroad, to some extent, by dramatically expanding applicants\u2019 social networks and the social capital to which they have access.", "AuthorKeywords": ["India", "migration infrastructure", "social media", "Student mobility"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085234874", "SubjectAreas": [["Demography", "SOCI", "3317"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"]], "AuthorData": {"57200756320": {"Name": "Jayadeva S.", "AuthorID": "57200756320", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Research Fellow at the UCL Institute of Education, She is also a Research Associate at the GIGA Institute of Asian Studies."}}}
