Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of SSIEM.Adult metabolic medicine (AMM) is an expanding medical subspecialty, due to the increasing number of adult patients with inherited metabolic diseases (IMD). However, a formal training and postgraduate education in this field is not available in the majority of countries. Existing adult metabolic specialists (AMS) come from many different backgrounds. The aim of this survey was to assess the state of play as regards education and training in AMM worldwide. Members of the Society for the Study of Inborn Error of Metabolism adult metabolic group (n = 89) were asked to take part in this survey. Forty-two AMS (47.2%) from 18 different countries completed the questionnaire. The most common specialties were internal medicine (38.1%), endocrinology (26.2%), genetics (21.4%), and neurology (21.4%). Ninety-five percent of respondents considered that practical clinical experience had contributed importantly for their professional development, while only 27% felt the same for formal academic education. The current state of available education and training was judged as generally poor or fair (73% of the respondents). The most suggested ways of improving education and training in AMM were: to facilitate international internships; to implement courses on adult-IMD; and to create a formal academic education. The skills considered most important for AMS were: recognition of signs and symptoms of diseases, knowledge of the available treatments, and ability to perform a correct follow up. In conclusion, worldwide, current available education and training in AMM is considered inadequate. This survey emphasizes the need for development of new, formal training opportunities to improve knowledge, and competence in this rapidly expanding field.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adult metabolic medicine", "education and training", "inherited metabolic diseases", "survey"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089954283", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)", "BIOC", "1301"]], "AuthorData": {"26323373600": {"Name": "Sechi A.", "AuthorID": "26323373600", "AffiliationID": "114374116", "AffiliationName": "Regional Coordinator Centre for Rare Diseases, Academic Hospital of Udine"}, "56574960200": {"Name": "Fabbro E.", "AuthorID": "56574960200", "AffiliationID": "60025965", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Udine"}, "14060686900": {"Name": "Langeveld M.", "AuthorID": "14060686900", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Academic Medical Centre, University of Amsterdam"}, "57217074345": {"Name": "Tullio A.", "AuthorID": "57217074345", "AffiliationID": "114374116", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Hygiene and Clinical Epidemiology, Academic Hospital of Udine"}, "7003596979": {"Name": "Lachmann R.", "AuthorID": "7003596979", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Charles Dent Metabolic Unit, NHNN"}, "23005241600": {"Name": "Mochel F.", "AuthorID": "23005241600", "AffiliationID": "60015622", "AffiliationName": "Reference Center for Neurometabolic Diseases, La Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatriere University Hospital"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
