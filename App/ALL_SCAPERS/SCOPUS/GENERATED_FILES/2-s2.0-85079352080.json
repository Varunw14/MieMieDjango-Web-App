While considered a hallmark of cognitive flexibility, the mechanisms underlying changes-of-mind remain elusive. Previous studies on perceptual decision making have focused on changes-of-mind that are primarily driven by the accumulation of additional noisy sensory evidence after the initial decision. In a motion discrimination task, we demonstrate that changes-of-mind can occur even in the absence of additional evidence after the initial decision. Unlike previous studies of changes-of-mind, the majority of changes-of-mind in our experiment occurred in trials with prolonged initial response times. This suggests a distinct mechanism underlying such changes. Using a neural circuit model of decision uncertainty and change-of-mind behaviour, we demonstrate that this phenomenon is associated with top-down signals mediated by an uncertainty-monitoring neural population. Such a mechanism is consistent with recent neurophysiological evidence showing a link between changes-of-mind and elevated top-down neural activity. Our model explains the long response times associated with changes-of-mind through high decision uncertainty levels in such trials, and accounts for the observed motor response trajectories. Overall, our work provides a computational framework that explains changes-of-mind in the absence of new post-decision evidence.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Computational Biology", "Decision Making", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Models, Neurological", "Reaction Time", "Uncertainty", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079352080", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"]], "AuthorData": {"57209214199": {"Name": "Atiya N.A.A.", "AuthorID": "57209214199", "AffiliationID": "60020730", "AffiliationName": "Intelligent Systems Research Centre, Engineering and Intelligent Systems, Ulster University"}, "26532134800": {"Name": "Wong-Lin K.F.", "AuthorID": "26532134800", "AffiliationID": "60020730", "AffiliationName": "Intelligent Systems Research Centre, Engineering and Intelligent Systems, Ulster University"}, "55151139600": {"Name": "Zgonnikov A.", "AuthorID": "55151139600", "AffiliationID": "60008539", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, National University of Ireland Galway"}, "57216838316": {"Name": "O'Hora D.", "AuthorID": "57216838316", "AffiliationID": "60008539", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, National University of Ireland Galway"}, "56957027200": {"Name": "Schoemann M.", "AuthorID": "56957027200", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Management/MAPP, Aarhus University"}, "26031640800": {"Name": "Scherbaum S.", "AuthorID": "26031640800", "AffiliationID": "60018353", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology"}}}
