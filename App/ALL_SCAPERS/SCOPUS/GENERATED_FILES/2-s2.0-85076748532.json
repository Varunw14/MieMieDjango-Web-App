Archaeometry published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of University of OxfordAspects of Roman pottery production at the workshops of Kontich, Tienen, Rumst, Grobbendonk and Clavier-Vervoz in the Civitas Tungrorum of central Belgium are explored. A total of 150 wasters from five sites were studied macroscopically, as well as via a combination of thin-section petrography, geochemistry and scanning electron microscopy, in order to gain insights into ceramic technology and aspects of the organization of production. Particular emphasis was given to the individual technological sequences and shared strategies of raw material selection, paste preparation and firing employed at the five adjacent sites. The integration of petrographic and geochemical data permitted the establishment of compositional reference groups for the Roman kiln sites of Civitas Tungrorum, which can be used to track their products within the surrounding landscape.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Belgium", "geochemistry", "organization of pottery production", "Roman ceramic technology", "scanning electron microscopy", "thin-section petrography"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076748532", "SubjectAreas": [["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"57193095803": {"Name": "Borgers B.", "AuthorID": "57193095803", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "22953938100": {"Name": "Quinn P.", "AuthorID": "22953938100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "6602705636": {"Name": "Degryse P.", "AuthorID": "6602705636", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Earth and Environmental Sciences, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"}, "26032974600": {"Name": "De Bie M.", "AuthorID": "26032974600", "AffiliationID": "60026810", "AffiliationName": "Kunstwetenschappen en Archeologie, Vrije Universiteit Brussel"}, "37108779400": {"Name": "Welkenhuysen K.", "AuthorID": "37108779400", "AffiliationID": "60068588", "AffiliationName": "Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences"}}}
