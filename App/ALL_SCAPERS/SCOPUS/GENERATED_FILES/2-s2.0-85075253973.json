All rights reserved.The aim of the study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the London Measure of Unplanned Pregnancy (LMUP) among female sex workers (FSWs) in Uganda. The LMUP was translated into Luganda and adapted for use with FSWs and underwent cognitive testing and two field tests. From the final Luganda LMUP, three other language versions were created (Acholi, Lugisu and Runyakole), and preliminary field test data were collected. Final data were collected from 819 FSWs attending the \u2017Most at Risk Population Initiative\u2018 clinics. The Luganda field testing showed that there were no missing data, the scale was well targeted, Cronbach\u2018s alpha was 0.82, weighted Kappa was 0.78, measurement was unidimensional, and all construct validity hypotheses were met. Likewise, with the Acholi, Lugisu, and Runyankole translations, field testing showed that there were no missing data, the scales were well targeted, Cronbach\u2018s alpha were>0.70, and measurement was unidimensional. We concluded that the Luganda LMUP is a valid and reliable tool for assessing pregnancy planning among FSWs in Uganda and that the Acholi, Lugisu, and Runyankole versions of the LMUP also had good initial psychometric properties.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Female sex workers", "Pregnancy planning", "Psychometric validation", "Uganda"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Female", "Humans", "Intention", "Male", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy, Unplanned", "Psychometrics", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sex Workers", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Translating", "Uganda"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075253973", "SubjectAreas": [["Reproductive Medicine", "MEDI", "2743"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"37090305200": {"Name": "Bukenya J.N.", "AuthorID": "37090305200", "AffiliationID": "60196602", "AffiliationName": "Department of Community Health and Behavioural Sciences, School of Public Health, College of Health Sciences Makerere University"}, "45161747200": {"Name": "Nalwadda C.K.", "AuthorID": "45161747200", "AffiliationID": "60196602", "AffiliationName": "Department of Community Health and Behavioural Sciences, School of Public Health, College of Health Sciences Makerere University"}, "57206137057": {"Name": "Neema S.", "AuthorID": "57206137057", "AffiliationID": "60071676", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology, School of Social Sciences, College of Humanities and Social Science, Makerere University"}, "57209389288": {"Name": "Kyambadde P.", "AuthorID": "57209389288", "AffiliationID": "60071670", "AffiliationName": "AIDS Control, Ministry of Health"}, "14059257900": {"Name": "Wanyenze R.K.", "AuthorID": "14059257900", "AffiliationID": "60196602", "AffiliationName": "Department of Disease Control and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, College of Health Sciences Makerere University"}, "7102177355": {"Name": "Barrett G.", "AuthorID": "7102177355", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2018s Health, University College London"}}}
