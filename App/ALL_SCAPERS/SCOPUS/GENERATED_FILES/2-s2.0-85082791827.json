The robotic platform offers a new approach to radical cystectomy, but the benefits are unclear. This review examines the latest evidence, with a particular focus on developments in the last two years. RECENT FINDINGS: Prospective evaluations of open (ORC) and robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) are emerging. The radical cystectomy in patients with bladder cancer trial reported in 2018 and demonstrated oncological noninferiority for both approaches and marginal shorter length of stays with RARC using an extracorporeal reconstruction. The trial confirmed prospective randomized comparisons are possible, and replicates observations from two earlier, smaller randomised controlled trials with longer follow-up. Although there has been significant traction to the intracorporeal approach to RARC, randomized trial evidence is awaited to show any benefit over ORC. SUMMARY: New evidence alludes to the noninferiority of the robotic platform in radical cystectomy in comparison to open surgery. There is minimal evidence of a clinically meaningful benefit. Until this is addressed, ORC remains the gold standard for the definitive surgical management of bladder cancer.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cystectomy", "Humans", "Postoperative Complications", "Robotic Surgical Procedures", "Robotics", "Treatment Outcome", "Urinary Bladder Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082791827", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"56939014200": {"Name": "Khetrapal P.", "AuthorID": "56939014200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "7404901815": {"Name": "Kelly J.D.", "AuthorID": "7404901815", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "57212211573": {"Name": "Conroy S.", "AuthorID": "57212211573", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Academic Urology Unit, University of Sheffield"}, "6603789337": {"Name": "Catto J.W.F.", "AuthorID": "6603789337", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Academic Urology Unit, University of Sheffield"}}}
