Published by Wiley-VCH GmbHA one-dimensional nanotubular metal\u2013organic framework (MOF) [Ni(Cu-H4TPPA)]\u22c52 (CH3)2NH2+ (H8TPPA=5,10,15,20-tetrakis[p-phenylphosphonic acid] porphyrin) constructed by using the arylphosphonic acid H8TPPA is reported. The structure of this MOF, known as GTUB-4, was solved by using single-crystal X-ray diffraction and its geometric accessible surface area was calculated to be 1102 m2 g\u22121, making it the phosphonate MOF with the highest reported surface area. Due to the extended conjugation of its porphyrin core, GTUB-4 possesses narrow indirect and direct bandgaps (1.9 eV and 2.16 eV, respectively) in the semiconductor regime. Thermogravimetric analysis suggests that GTUB-4 is thermally stable up to 400 \u00b0C. Owing to its high surface area, low bandgap, and high thermal stability, GTUB-4 could find applications as electrodes in supercapacitors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["high surface area", "ligand design", "metal\u2013organic frameworks", "nanotubes", "semiconductive MOFs"], "IndexKeywords": ["Accessible surface areas", "Extended conjugation", "High surface area", "High thermal stability", "Narrow band gap", "Phenylphosphonic acids", "Single crystal x-ray diffraction", "Thermally stable"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092593705", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"8268665700": {"Name": "Y\u00fccesan G.", "AuthorID": "8268665700", "AffiliationID": "60011604", "AffiliationName": "Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Department of Food Chemistry and Toxicology"}, "23007635000": {"Name": "Ayhan M.M.", "AuthorID": "23007635000", "AffiliationID": "60013071", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Gebze Technical University"}, "57217219200": {"Name": "Bayraktar C.", "AuthorID": "57217219200", "AffiliationID": "60013071", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Gebze Technical University"}, "24280865300": {"Name": "Zorlu Y.", "AuthorID": "24280865300", "AffiliationID": "60013071", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Gebze Technical University"}, "57209684879": {"Name": "Yu K.B.", "AuthorID": "57209684879", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "14061497000": {"Name": "Yazaydin A.O.", "AuthorID": "14061497000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "8628103200": {"Name": "Hanna G.", "AuthorID": "8628103200", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "University of Alberta, Department of Chemistry"}}}
