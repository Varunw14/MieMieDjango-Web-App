Published by BMJ.Objectives Lifestyle may affect observed associations between glucocorticoid use and adverse events. This study aimed to investigate whether lifestyle differ according to use of systemic glucocorticoids. Design Population-based cross-sectional study. Setting The Central Denmark Region. Participants 30 245 adults (\u226525 years of age) who participated in a questionnaire-based public health survey in 2010. Outcome measures Systemic glucocorticoid use was categorised as never use, current use (prescription redemption \u226490 days before completing the questionnaire), recent use (prescription redemption 91-365 days before completing the questionnaire), former use (prescription redemption >365 days before completing the questionnaire) and according to cumulative dose expressed in prednisolone equivalents (<100, 100-499, 500-999, 1000-1999, 2000-4999, \u22655000 mg). We computed the prevalence of lifestyle factors (body mass index, smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity and dietary habits) according to glucocorticoid use. We then estimated age-adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) and 95% CIs, comparing the categories of glucocorticoid users versus never users. All analyses were stratified by sex. Results Of the 30 245 participants (53% women, median age 53 years), 563 (1.9%) were current users, 885 (2.9%) were recent users, 3054 (10%) were former users and 25 743 (85%) were never users. Ever users of glucocorticoids had a slightly higher prevalence of obesity than never users (18% vs 14%, aPR=1.4, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.5 in women and 17% vs 15%, aPR=1.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.4 in men). In women, ever users of glucocorticoids had a slightly lower prevalence of high-risk alcohol consumption compared with never users (17% vs 20%, aPR=0.8, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.0). Smoking, diet and physical activity did not differ substantially according to use of glucocorticoids. Conclusion Our study provides a framework for quantifying potential uncontrolled confounding by lifestyle factors in studies of systemic glucocorticoids.", "AuthorKeywords": ["alcohol drinking", "body mass index", "diet", "exercise", "glucocorticoids", "smoking"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alcohol Drinking", "Body Mass Index", "Case-Control Studies", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Denmark", "Diet", "Exercise", "Female", "Glucocorticoids", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Obesity", "Overweight", "Prevalence", "Smoking"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074274764", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55843648700": {"Name": "Laugesen K.", "AuthorID": "55843648700", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital"}, "23009891600": {"Name": "Petersen I.", "AuthorID": "23009891600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College, London Medical School"}, "7201717857": {"Name": "Pedersen L.", "AuthorID": "7201717857", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital"}, "36038149900": {"Name": "S\u00f8rensen H.T.T.", "AuthorID": "36038149900", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital"}, "57211524244": {"Name": "Breinholt Larsen F.", "AuthorID": "57211524244", "AffiliationID": "113161807", "AffiliationName": "Public Health and Quality Improvement"}, "8081653500": {"Name": "J\u00f8rgensen J.O.L.", "AuthorID": "8081653500", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Endocrinology and Internal Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital"}}}
