METHODS: Fourteen decedents (mean age at death 72.6 \u00b1 7.2 years) without known clinical diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease and meeting pathology criteria only for no or low Alzheimer disease (AD) pathologic change were selected from the Normal Aging Brain Collection Amsterdam database. In situ brain MRI included 3D T1-weighted images for anatomical registration and diffusion tensor imaging for probabilistic tractography with subsequent structural network construction. Network topologic measures of centrality (degree), integration (global efficiency), and segregation (clustering and local efficiency) were calculated. Tissue sections from 12 cortical regions were sampled and immunostained for A\u03b2 and hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau), and histopathologic burden was determined. Linear mixed effect models were used to assess the relationship between A\u03b2 and p-tau load and network topologic measures. RESULTS: A\u03b2 was present in 79% of cases and predominantly consisted of diffuse plaques; p-tau was sparsely present. Linear mixed effect models showed independent negative associations between A\u03b2 load and global efficiency (\u03b2 = -0.83 \u00d7 10-3, p = 0.014), degree (\u03b2 = -0.47, p = 0.034), and clustering (\u03b2 = -0.55 \u00d7 10-2, p = 0.043). A positive association was present between A\u03b2 load and local efficiency (\u03b2 = 3.16 \u00d7 10-3, p = 0.035). Regionally, these results were significant in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) for degree (\u03b2 = -2.22, p < 0.001) and local efficiency (\u03b2 = 1.01 \u00d7 10-2, p = 0.014) and precuneus for clustering (\u03b2 = -0.91 \u00d7 10-2, p = 0.017). There was no relationship between p-tau and network topology. CONCLUSION: This study in deceased adults with AD-related pathologic change provides evidence for a relationship among early A\u03b2 accumulation, predominantly of the diffuse type, and structural network topology, specifically of the PCC and precuneus.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Brain", "Diffusion Tensor Imaging", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nerve Net", "Neural Networks, Computer"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089129913", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56545492300": {"Name": "Jonkman L.E.", "AuthorID": "56545492300", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": null}, "55653016200": {"Name": "Steenwijk M.D.", "AuthorID": "55653016200", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": null}, "57218407272": {"Name": "Boesen N.", "AuthorID": "57218407272", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": null}, "6602721302": {"Name": "Rozemuller A.J.M.", "AuthorID": "6602721302", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": null}, "57204594265": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "57204594265", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": null}, "26643174700": {"Name": "Geurts J.J.G.", "AuthorID": "26643174700", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": null}, "57210656352": {"Name": "Douw L.", "AuthorID": "57210656352", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": null}, "6603310899": {"Name": "van de Berg W.D.J.", "AuthorID": "6603310899", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": null}}}
