All rights reserved.We have studied the effect of elevated temperatures (up to 150\u00b0C) on sandstone deformation, with a focus on the brittle-ductile transition and the ductile regime. This was executed through triaxial deformation experiments, performed at a range of effective pressures on fluid saturated cores of sandstone. Samples were deformed at room temperature or at elevated temperatures under either constant strain rate (10-5 s-1) or constant stress (creep) conditions. Constant strain rate tests in the ductile regime show that at 150\u00b0C the differential stress required for the onset of compaction is reduced by 10-20 MPa, with the exact amount being a function of sandstone composition and the effective pressure. The pressure of the brittle-ductile transition is also reduced by the temperature increase. During constant stress tests, which run for a few days to a few weeks, samples are initially loaded at a constant strain rate, before being held at a set stress value. The strain rate at which the sandstone continues to deform decreases with increasing time and can reach rates as low as 10-8 s-1. At 150\u00b0C the sandstone underwent compactant creep at similar strain rates to its room temperature counterpart, but with a differential stress reduction of 20-30 MPa.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086057906", "SubjectAreas": [["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"], ["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"]], "AuthorData": {"57195625998": {"Name": "Jefferd M.", "AuthorID": "57195625998", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "25924737100": {"Name": "Brantut N.", "AuthorID": "25924737100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7102997852": {"Name": "Meredith P.", "AuthorID": "7102997852", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "39262157300": {"Name": "Mitchell T.", "AuthorID": "39262157300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
