Compared to more traditional postcombustion and pre-combustion capture methods, oxy-fuel technology produces a CO2 stream with relatively high concentration of impurities that may require partial or a high level of removal and whose presence can be expected to increase the costs of CO2 compression. Four types of compression technologies employed include four-stage compressor with 4 intercoolers, single-stage supersonic shockwave compressor, three-stage compressor combined with subcritical liquefaction and pumping and three-stage compressor combined with supercritical liquefaction and pumping. The study depicts that decrement of the impurities content from 15 to 0.7%v/v in the CO2 streams reduced the total compression power in the compression system. The study also concludes that three-stage compressor combined with subcritical liquefaction and pumping can potentially offer higher efficiency than four-stage compressor with 4 intercoolers for almost pure CO2 streams. In the case of raw oxy-fuel mixture, that carries relatively large amount of impurities, subcritical liquefaction proved to be less feasible, while supercritical liquefaction efficiency is only marginally lower than that in the four-stage compressor with 4 intercoolers.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["CO2 compression", "Compression power", "Compression system", "Compression technologies", "Higher efficiency", "Impurities contents", "Oxyfuel technology", "Pre combustions"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078210835", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"36087330300": {"Name": "Daud N.K.", "AuthorID": "36087330300", "AffiliationID": "60090654", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Chemical and Process Engineering Technology, Universiti Malaysia Pahang, Lebuhraya Tun Razak"}, "26531554000": {"Name": "Martynov S.", "AuthorID": "26531554000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003505415": {"Name": "Mahgerefteh H.", "AuthorID": "7003505415", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "6508164838": {"Name": "Nasuha N.", "AuthorID": "6508164838", "AffiliationID": "60004351", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Chemical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Cawangan Pulau Pinang, Kampus Permatang Pauh"}}}
