International Journal of Cosmetic Science published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Cosmetic Scientists and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de Cosmetologi\u00e9Objectives: Laboratory in vitro permeation processes require the use of modified Franz type diffusion cells which are conventionally fabricated from glass. Fragility and high cost are frequently associated with this type of laboratory apparatus. The purpose of our present research was to develop a simple, economical and versatile approach to manufacture Franz type cells using additive manufacturing (AM). Methods: Graphical Franz diffusion cell designs were reproduced with a stereolithography (SLA) 3D printer and assessed over a minimum period of 24 h. The surface morphology of AM printouts was analysed before and after compatibility studies using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Comparative permeation studies in both glass and AM Franz type diffusion cells were conducted using a caffeine solution (1.5 mg mL\u20111), applied to a model silicone membrane. Results: Testing of the 3D printed scaffolds confirmed similar recovery of the permeant when compared to glass cells: 1.49 \u00b1 0.01 and 1.50 \u00b1 0.01 mg mL\u20111, respectively, after 72 h. No significant differences were visible from the SEM micrographs demonstrating consistent, smooth and non-porous surfaces of the AM Franz cells\u2019 core structure. Permeation studies using transparent 3D printed constructs resulted in 12.85 \u00b1 0.53 \u00b5g cm\u20112 caffeine recovery in the receptor solution after 180 min with comparable permeant recovery, 11.49 \u00b1 1.04 \u00b5g cm\u20112, for the glass homologues. Conclusion: AM constructs can be considered as viable alternatives to the use of conventional glass apparatus offering a simple, reproducible and cost-effective method of replicating specialised laboratory glassware. A wider range of permeants will be investigated in future studies with these novel 3D printed Franz diffusion cells.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D printing", "Franz cells", "In vitro", "permeation studies", "SEM analysis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086323154", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (miscellaneous)", "CHEM", "1601"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"], ["Colloid and Surface Chemistry", "CENG", "1505"]], "AuthorData": {"57193268987": {"Name": "Sil B.C.", "AuthorID": "57193268987", "AffiliationID": "60002826", "AffiliationName": "London Metropolitan University"}, "57217120731": {"Name": "Cristofoli M.", "AuthorID": "57217120731", "AffiliationID": "60002826", "AffiliationName": "London Metropolitan University"}, "57217116254": {"Name": "Belgrave R.G.", "AuthorID": "57217116254", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Chemical Engineering, Torrington Place"}, "57204587278": {"Name": "Alvarez M.P.", "AuthorID": "57204587278", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "56673353300": {"Name": "Luo L.", "AuthorID": "56673353300", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "56258044400": {"Name": "Penny M.R.", "AuthorID": "56258044400", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "57213994372": {"Name": "Hadgraft J.", "AuthorID": "57213994372", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "7102480402": {"Name": "Hilton S.T.", "AuthorID": "7102480402", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "56393831400": {"Name": "Lane M.E.", "AuthorID": "56393831400", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "56667886700": {"Name": "Moore D.J.", "AuthorID": "56667886700", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "GSK Consumer Healthcare, Skin Health R&D"}}}
