The nature of the technique permits the spatial localization of the diffraction information in 3D and mapping of heterogeneities from the electrode to the particle level. An overall decrease of 0.4% and 0.6% was observed for the unit cell volume after 100 cycles for the electrodes cycled to 4.2 and 4.7 V. Additionally, focused ion beam-scanning electron microscope cross-sections indicate extensive particle cracking as a function of upper cut-off voltage, further confirming that severe cycling stresses exacerbate degradation. Finally, the technique facilitates the detection of parts of the electrode that have inhomogeneous lattice parameters that deviate from the bulk of the sample, further highlighting the effectiveness of the technique as a diagnostic tool, bridging the gap between crystal structure and electrochemical performance.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Crystal dimensions", "Electrochemical cycling", "Electrochemical performance", "Negative electrode", "Particle-cracking", "Spatial localization", "Spatial resolution", "Unit-cell dimensions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089818851", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57191666829": {"Name": "Daemi S.R.", "AuthorID": "57191666829", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57191663553": {"Name": "Tan C.", "AuthorID": "57191663553", "AffiliationID": "60172680", "AffiliationName": "Faraday Institution, Quad One, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "57044825000": {"Name": "Heenan T.M.M.", "AuthorID": "57044825000", "AffiliationID": "60172680", "AffiliationName": "Faraday Institution, Quad One, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "6603015230": {"Name": "Weaving J.S.", "AuthorID": "6603015230", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56110123700": {"Name": "Jervis R.", "AuthorID": "56110123700", "AffiliationID": "60172680", "AffiliationName": "Faraday Institution, Quad One, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.J.L.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60172680", "AffiliationName": "Faraday Institution, Quad One, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.R.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60172680", "AffiliationName": "Faraday Institution, Quad One, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "56743361600": {"Name": "Vamvakeros A.", "AuthorID": "56743361600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6603792904": {"Name": "Di Michiel M.", "AuthorID": "6603792904", "AffiliationID": "60032633", "AffiliationName": "Esrf, European Synchrotron"}, "8889480300": {"Name": "Beale A.M.", "AuthorID": "8889480300", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus, Rutherford Appleton Laboratories Harwell"}, "7101952456": {"Name": "Jacques S.", "AuthorID": "7101952456", "AffiliationID": "60170282", "AffiliationName": "Finden Limited, Merchant House"}, "56613490600": {"Name": "Finegan D.P.", "AuthorID": "56613490600", "AffiliationID": "60030451", "AffiliationName": "National Renewable Energy Laboratory"}, "36806907600": {"Name": "Cookson J.", "AuthorID": "36806907600", "AffiliationID": "60027782", "AffiliationName": "Johnson Matthey Technology Centre"}, "33368259200": {"Name": "Petrucco E.", "AuthorID": "33368259200", "AffiliationID": "60027782", "AffiliationName": "Johnson Matthey Technology Centre"}}}
