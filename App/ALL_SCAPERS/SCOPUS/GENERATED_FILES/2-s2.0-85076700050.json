This has prompted the creation of privacy-enhanced cryptocurrencies such as Monero and Zcash, which are specifically designed to counteract the tracking analysis possible in currencies like Bitcoin. These cryptocurrencies, however, also suffer from some drawbacks: in both Monero and Zcash, the set of potential unspent coins is always growing, which means users cannot store a concise representation of the blockchain. Additionally, Zcash requires a common reference string and the fact that addresses are reused multiple times in Monero has led to attacks to its anonymity. In this paper we propose a new design for anonymous cryptocurrencies, Quisquis, that achieves provably secure notions of anonymity. Quisquis stores a relatively small amount of data, does not require trusted setup, and in Quisquis each address appears on the blockchain at most twice: once when it is generated as output of a transaction, and once when it is spent as input to a transaction. Our result is achieved by combining a DDH-based tool (that we call updatable keys) with efficient zero-knowledge arguments.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Common reference string", "Concise representations", "Provably secure", "Tracking analysis", "Zero knowledge"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076700050", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"56030339100": {"Name": "Fauzi P.", "AuthorID": "56030339100", "AffiliationID": "122730038", "AffiliationName": "Simula UiB"}, "36717929200": {"Name": "Meiklejohn S.", "AuthorID": "36717929200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57202742441": {"Name": "Mercer R.", "AuthorID": "57202742441", "AffiliationID": "122859471", "AffiliationName": "O(1) Labs"}, "26646817800": {"Name": "Orlandi C.", "AuthorID": "26646817800", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, DIGIT, Aarhus University"}}}
