To date, its synthesis process is limited to the bottom-up method which lacks the targeting and homogeneity. Herein, we proposed a hydrogen-initiated chemical epitaxial growth strategy at a relatively low temperature for the fabrication of graphene/carbon nitride in-plane heterostructure. Theoretical and experimental analysis proved that methane via in situ generation from the hydrogenated decomposition of carbon nitride triggered the graphene growth along the active sites at the edges of confined spaces. With the enhanced electrical field from the deposited graphene (0.5%), the performances on selective photo-oxidation and photocatalytic water splitting were promoted by 5.5 and 3.7 times, respectively. Meanwhile, a 7720 \u03bcmol/h/g(graphene) hydrogen evolution rate was acquired without any cocatalysts. This study provides an top-down strategy to synthesize in-plane catalyst for the utilization of solar energy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["carbon nitride/graphene", "hydrogen-initiated chemical epitaxial growth", "intralayer heterojunction", "photo-oxidation", "photocatalytic water splitting"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bottom up methods", "Electrical field", "Experimental analysis", "Heterostructured photocatalyst", "Hydrogen evolution rate", "Interlaminar space", "Photocatalytic water splitting", "Synthesis process"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85097848921", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56596875300": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "56596875300", "AffiliationID": "60105210", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, Edith Cowan University"}, "57210753091": {"Name": "Zhao X.", "AuthorID": "57210753091", "AffiliationID": "60105210", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, Edith Cowan University"}, "56666196900": {"Name": "Wang S.", "AuthorID": "56666196900", "AffiliationID": "60105210", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, Edith Cowan University"}, "57200497112": {"Name": "Xu X.", "AuthorID": "57200497112", "AffiliationID": "60105210", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, Edith Cowan University"}, "57210002292": {"Name": "Shi L.", "AuthorID": "57210002292", "AffiliationID": "60105210", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, Edith Cowan University"}, "14072230600": {"Name": "Zhang L.C.", "AuthorID": "14072230600", "AffiliationID": "60105210", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, Edith Cowan University"}, "36437774300": {"Name": "Sun H.", "AuthorID": "36437774300", "AffiliationID": "60105210", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, Edith Cowan University"}, "55588581000": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "55588581000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "57188646908": {"Name": "Zhang H.", "AuthorID": "57188646908", "AffiliationID": "60009512", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Engineering, University of Adelaide"}, "57208890312": {"Name": "Wang S.", "AuthorID": "57208890312", "AffiliationID": "60009512", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Engineering, University of Adelaide"}, "57208906783": {"Name": "Wang L.", "AuthorID": "57208906783", "AffiliationID": "60025441, 60033100", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Mater-Oriental Chemical Engineering, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing Tech University"}, "37664686000": {"Name": "Chen H.", "AuthorID": "37664686000", "AffiliationID": "60025441", "AffiliationName": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Process Enhancement and New Energy Equipment Technology, Jiangsu Engineering Laboratory of Energy Conservation and Environmental Protection Technologies and Equipment in Process Industry, School of Mechanical and Power Engineering, Nanjing Tech University"}, "23092202000": {"Name": "Veder J.P.", "AuthorID": "23092202000", "AffiliationID": "60031226, 60189232", "AffiliationName": "John de Laeter Centre, Curtin University"}, "55840917800": {"Name": "Zhao S.", "AuthorID": "55840917800", "AffiliationID": "60001416, 60031226", "AffiliationName": "Fuels and Energy Technology Institute, Western Australia School of Mines: Minerals, Energy and Chemical Engineering, Curtin University"}, "8434639600": {"Name": "Nealon G.", "AuthorID": "8434639600", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Microscopy Characterisation and Analysis, University of Western Australia"}, "7405595915": {"Name": "Wu M.", "AuthorID": "7405595915", "AffiliationID": "60105111, 60103279", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Heavy Oil Processing, Institute of New Energy, College of Chemical Engineering, China University of Petroleum (East China)"}}}
