This ranges from supplementing contemporary data to increase the power of trials to cross-trial comparisons in estimating comparative efficacy. In many cases, these approaches are performed without in-depth review of the context of data, which may lead to bias and incorrect conclusions. Methods: We discuss the original \u2018Pocock\u2019 criteria for the use of historical data and how the use of historical data has evolved over time. Based on these factors and personal experience, we created a series of questions that may be asked of historical data, prior to their use. Based on the answers to these questions, various statistical approaches are recommended. The strategy is illustrated with a case study in colorectal cancer. Results: A number of areas need to be considered with historical data, which we split into three categories: outcome measurement, study/patient characteristics (including setting and inclusion/exclusion criteria), and disease process/intervention effects. Each of these areas may introduce issues if not appropriately handled, while some may preclude the use of historical data entirely. We present a tool (in the form of a table) for highlighting any such issues. Application of the tool to a colorectal cancer data set demonstrates under what conditions historical data could be used and what the limitations of such an analysis would be. Conclusion: Historical data can be a powerful tool to augment or compare with contemporary trial data, though caution is required. We present some of the issues that may be considered when involving historical data and what (if any) statistical approaches may account for differences between studies. We recommend that, where historical data are to be used in analyses, potential differences between studies are addressed explicitly.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Historical control", "matching-adjusted indirect comparison", "power prior", "propensity scoring"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091349375", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"56414854100": {"Name": "Hatswell A.", "AuthorID": "56414854100", "AffiliationID": "121016418", "AffiliationName": "Delta Hat Limited"}, "6603354734": {"Name": "Baio G.", "AuthorID": "6603354734", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "57204674407": {"Name": "Freemantle N.", "AuthorID": "57204674407", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology, University College London"}, "19135017500": {"Name": "Lesaffre E.", "AuthorID": "19135017500", "AffiliationID": "60121251, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "L-Biostat, KU Leuven"}, "26041070200": {"Name": "van Rosmalen J.", "AuthorID": "26041070200", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics, Erasmus MC"}}}
