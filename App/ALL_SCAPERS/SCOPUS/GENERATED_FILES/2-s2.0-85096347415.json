Here, we compare two different methods, spin coating and aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition (AACVD), for the synthesis of transparent fluorine-free superhydrophobic coatings. The material was made from a nanocomposite of (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) functional mesoporous silica nanoparticles and titanium cross-linked polydimethylsiloxane with particle concentrations between 9 to 50 wt %. The silane that was used to lower the surface energy consisted of a long hydrocarbon chain without fluorine groups to reduce the environmental impact of the composite coating. Both spin coating and AACVD resulted in the formation of superhydrophobic surfaces with advancing contact angles up to 168\u00b0, a hysteresis of 3\u00b0, and a transparency of 90% at 550 nm. AACVD has proven to produce more uniform coatings with concentrations as low as 9 wt %, reaching superhydrophobicity. The metal oxide cross-linking improves the adhesion of the coating to the glass. Overall, AACVD was the more optimal method to prepare superhydrophobic coatings compared to spin coating due to higher contact angles, adhesion, and scalability of the fabrication process.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Advancing contact angle", "Aerosol assisted chemical vapor depositions (AACVD)", "Fabrication process", "Mesoporous silica nanoparticles", "Nano-composite coating", "Particle concentrations", "Super-hydrophobic surfaces", "Superhydrophobic coatings"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096347415", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Surfaces and Interfaces", "PHYS", "3110"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"], ["Electrochemistry", "CHEM", "1603"]], "AuthorData": {"57218990586": {"Name": "Janowicz N.J.", "AuthorID": "57218990586", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "35323167300": {"Name": "Tiwari M.K.", "AuthorID": "35323167300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences, University College London"}, "57219969200": {"Name": "Li H.", "AuthorID": "57219969200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57203344268": {"Name": "Heale F.L.", "AuthorID": "57203344268", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57213083930": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "57213083930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003437916": {"Name": "Carmalt C.J.", "AuthorID": "7003437916", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "8306417100": {"Name": "Papakonstantinou I.", "AuthorID": "8306417100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Photonic Innovations Lab, Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
