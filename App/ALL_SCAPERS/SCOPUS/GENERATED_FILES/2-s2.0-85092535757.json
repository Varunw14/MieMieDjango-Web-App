Despite growing scientific literature in the field, there remains a limited number of international qualitative studies investigating victims\u2019 needs. This study aims to explore the experiences of people who have been sex trafficked in a Western country and how this impacted their mental health, as described in online first-person accounts. First-person online narratives of sex trafficking victims (n = 30) were retrieved from a systematic online search. A thematic analysis identified overarching themes, with the most prominent being 1) preexisting vulnerabilities, 2) psychological mechanisms involved in trafficking (i.e. deception, manipulation), and 3) barriers to recovery. The results showed how preexisting vulnerabilities can impact victims\u2019 susceptibility to trafficking and how psychological control tactics utilized in the trafficking process maintain victims\u2019 vulnerability. The results of this thematic analysis provide insight into the diverse set of mental, social, and legal needs that trafficking victims face and may inform potential post-trafficking interventions to meet these needs and prevention efforts to reduce vulnerability to trafficking. Further implications and methodological considerations are discussed in full.", "AuthorKeywords": ["abuse", "Human trafficking", "intervention", "mental health", "qualitative", "sexual exploitation", "thematic analysis", "trauma"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092535757", "SubjectAreas": [["Demography", "SOCI", "3317"], ["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"], ["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"57219388188": {"Name": "Chu K.", "AuthorID": "57219388188", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "57190061236": {"Name": "Billings J.", "AuthorID": "57190061236", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}}}
