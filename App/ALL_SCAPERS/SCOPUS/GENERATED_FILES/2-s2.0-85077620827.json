HLH can be triggered by conditions such as infection, autoimmune disease and malignancy, among others. Both a familial and a secondary form have been described, the latter being increasingly recognised in adult patients with critical illness. HLH is difficult to diagnose, often under-recognised and carries a high mortality. Patients can present in a very similar fashion to sepsis and the two syndromes can co-exist and overlap, yet HLH requires specific immunosuppressive therapy. HLH should be actively excluded in patients with presumed sepsis who either lack a clear focus of infection or who are not responding to energetic infection management. Elevated serum ferritin is a key biomarker that may indicate the need for further investigations for HLH and can guide treatment. Early diagnosis and a multidisciplinary approach to HLH management may save lives.", "AuthorKeywords": ["haemophagocytic", "histiocytosis", "Lymphohistiocytosis", "macrophage activation syndrome", "sepsis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077620827", "SubjectAreas": [["Critical Care Nursing", "NURS", "2906"], ["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"]], "AuthorData": {"13204916600": {"Name": "Bauchmuller K.", "AuthorID": "13204916600", "AffiliationID": "60024453", "AffiliationName": "Department of Critical Care and Anaesthesia, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8238987600": {"Name": "Manson J.J.", "AuthorID": "8238987600", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005153427": {"Name": "Tattersall R.", "AuthorID": "7005153427", "AffiliationID": "60029387", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Rheumatology, Sheffield Children\u2019s NHS Trust"}, "57195149623": {"Name": "Brown M.", "AuthorID": "57195149623", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research Department, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "23473657500": {"Name": "McNamara C.", "AuthorID": "23473657500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7401654716": {"Name": "Singer M.", "AuthorID": "7401654716", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Bloomsbury Institute of Intensive Care Medicine, University College London"}, "57205449459": {"Name": "Brett S.J.", "AuthorID": "57205449459", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}}}
