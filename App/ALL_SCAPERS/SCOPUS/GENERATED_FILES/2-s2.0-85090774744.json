However, little empirical research explores the embodied practices of these projects occasion. We identify two key tensions intrinsic to such projects; the tension between expert/professional knowledge and lay/experiential knowledge, and between co-producers as different from or typical of the public they are representing. Methods: We explored how these tensions were manifested and responded to in ongoing interactions by analysing video recordings of co-design groups where people with intellectual disabilities engaged in the production of Easy Read materials. Results: We noticed the instability of participants\u2019 claims to expert/professional knowledge and the challenges of attending to and mobilising participants\u2019 experiential knowledge within the constraints of the group task. Conclusions: Interactional dynamics were managed to preserve consensus and homogeneity within the groups, with the potential for reinforcing a limited identity associated with \u201cintellectual disability.\u201d.", "AuthorKeywords": ["accessible information", "co-design", "Co-production", "discourse analysis", "Easy Read", "intellectual disabilities"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090774744", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"36674720300": {"Name": "Chinn D.", "AuthorID": "36674720300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing, Midwifery and Palliative Care, King\u2019s College"}, "57218922153": {"Name": "Pelletier C.", "AuthorID": "57218922153", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
