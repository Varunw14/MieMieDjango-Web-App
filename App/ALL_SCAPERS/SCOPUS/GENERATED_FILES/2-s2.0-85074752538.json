The low viscosity of basaltic magmas inhibits fragmentation, which favours effusive and lava-fountaining activity, yet highly explosive, hazardous basaltic eruptions occur. The processes that promote fragmentation of basaltic magma remain unclear and are subject to debate. Here we used a numerical conduit model to show that a rapid magma ascent during explosive eruptions produces a large undercooling. In situ experiments revealed that undercooling drives exceptionally rapid (in minutes) crystallization, which induces a step change in viscosity that triggers magma fragmentation. The experimentally produced textures are consistent with basaltic Plinian eruption products. We applied a numerical model to investigate basaltic magma fragmentation over a wide parameter space and found that all basaltic volcanoes have the potential to produce highly explosive eruptions. The critical requirements are initial magma temperatures lower than 1,100 \u00b0C to reach a syn-eruptive crystal content of over 30 vol%, and thus a magma viscosity around 105 Pa s, which our results suggest is the minimum viscosity required for the fragmentation of fast ascending basaltic magmas. These temperature, crystal content and viscosity requirements reveal how typically effusive basaltic volcanoes can produce unexpected highly explosive and hazardous eruptions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074752538", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"36598043900": {"Name": "Arzilli F.", "AuthorID": "36598043900", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "55304721500": {"Name": "La Spina G.", "AuthorID": "55304721500", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "7202920163": {"Name": "Burton M.", "AuthorID": "7202920163", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "6603164715": {"Name": "Polacci M.", "AuthorID": "6603164715", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "35210390100": {"Name": "Hartley M.", "AuthorID": "35210390100", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "57211669358": {"Name": "Bamber E.", "AuthorID": "57211669358", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "55765717500": {"Name": "Le Gall N.", "AuthorID": "55765717500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "8504683300": {"Name": "Lee P.", "AuthorID": "8504683300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "55259737900": {"Name": "Di Genova D.", "AuthorID": "55259737900", "AffiliationID": "60021841", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Non-Metallic Materials, Clausthal University of Technology"}, "35090012600": {"Name": "Cai B.", "AuthorID": "35090012600", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Metallurgy and Materials, University of Birmingham"}, "37361632300": {"Name": "Vo N.", "AuthorID": "37361632300", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "57201801522": {"Name": "Nonni S.", "AuthorID": "57201801522", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "7004160996": {"Name": "Atwood R.", "AuthorID": "7004160996", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "57203668452": {"Name": "Llewellin E.", "AuthorID": "57203668452", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Durham University"}, "7006668591": {"Name": "Brooker R.", "AuthorID": "7006668591", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "7006758341": {"Name": "Mader H.", "AuthorID": "7006758341", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth Sciences, University of Bristol"}}}
