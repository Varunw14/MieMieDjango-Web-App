Although this effect was exploited more than seven decades ago in Vonnegut\u2019s pioneering cloud seeding experiments, it remains unclear what makes a material a good ice former. Here, we show through a machine learning analysis of nucleation simulations on a database of diverse model substrates that a set of physical descriptors for heterogeneous ice nucleation can be identified. Our results reveal that, beyond Vonnegut\u2019s connection with the lattice match to ice, three new microscopic factors help to predict the ice nucleating ability. These are: local ordering induced in liquid water, density reduction of liquid water near the surface and corrugation of the adsorption energy landscape felt by water. With this we take a step towards quantitative understanding of heterogeneous ice nucleation and the in silico design of materials to control ice formation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091278944", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55781212900": {"Name": "Fitzner M.", "AuthorID": "55781212900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175885, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Young Centre, London Centre for Nanotechnology and Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "55536536300": {"Name": "Pedevilla P.", "AuthorID": "55536536300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175885, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Young Centre, London Centre for Nanotechnology and Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56210204700": {"Name": "Michaelides A.", "AuthorID": "56210204700", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}}}
