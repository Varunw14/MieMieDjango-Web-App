High-throughput gene expression studies of human MTLE have the potential to uncover molecular changes underlying disease pathogenesis along with novel therapeutic targets. Using RNA- and small RNA-sequencing in parrallel, we explored differentially expressed genes in the hippocampus and cortex of MTLE patients who had undergone surgical resection and non-epileptic controls. We identified differentially expressed genes in the hippocampus of MTLE patients and differentially expressed small RNAs across both the cortex and hippocampus. We found significant enrichment for astrocytic and microglial genes among up-regulated genes, and down regulation of neuron specific genes in the hippocampus of MTLE patients. The transcriptome profile of the small RNAs reflected disease state more robustly than mRNAs, even across brain regions which show very little pathology. While mRNAs segregated predominately by brain region for MTLE and controls, small RNAs segregated by disease state. In particular, our data suggest that specific miRNAs (e.g., let-7b-3p and let-7c-3p) may be key regulators of multiple pathways related to MTLE pathology. Further, we report a strong association of other small RNA species with MTLE pathology. As such we have uncovered novel elements that may contribute to the establishment and progression of MTLE pathogenesis and that could be leveraged as therapeutic targets.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Epilepsy", "Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy", "microRNA", "Non-coding RNA", "Transcriptomics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Epilepsy, Temporal Lobe", "Female", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "RNA, Small Untranslated", "Transcriptome", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074197934", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"]], "AuthorData": {"55530992700": {"Name": "Mills J.D.", "AuthorID": "55530992700", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60008734", "AffiliationName": "Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Department of (Neuro)Pathology, Amsterdam Neuroscience"}, "35448476400": {"Name": "van Vliet E.A.", "AuthorID": "35448476400", "AffiliationID": "60013511, 60002483", "AffiliationName": "Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences, Center for Neuroscience, University of Amsterdam"}, "36990171400": {"Name": "Anink J.J.", "AuthorID": "36990171400", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60008734", "AffiliationName": "Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Department of (Neuro)Pathology, Amsterdam Neuroscience"}, "7005153143": {"Name": "Aronica E.", "AuthorID": "7005153143", "AffiliationID": "60027759", "AffiliationName": "Stichting Epilepsie Instellingen Nederland (SEIN), Heemstede"}, "57211805262": {"Name": "Chen B.J.", "AuthorID": "57211805262", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales"}, "6602088325": {"Name": "Janitz M.", "AuthorID": "6602088325", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales"}, "6603233868": {"Name": "Baayen J.C.", "AuthorID": "6603233868", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Department of Neurosurgery, Amsterdam Neuroscience"}, "56022857900": {"Name": "Idema S.", "AuthorID": "56022857900", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Department of Neurosurgery, Amsterdam Neuroscience"}, "57220411187": {"Name": "Devore S.", "AuthorID": "57220411187", "AffiliationID": "60032105", "AffiliationName": "Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, New York University Langone Medical Center"}, "7402079601": {"Name": "Friedman D.", "AuthorID": "7402079601", "AffiliationID": "60032105", "AffiliationName": "Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, New York University Langone Medical Center"}, "7102688352": {"Name": "Devinsky O.", "AuthorID": "7102688352", "AffiliationID": "60032105", "AffiliationName": "Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, New York University Langone Medical Center"}, "7003810636": {"Name": "Diehl B.", "AuthorID": "7003810636", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "7004423623": {"Name": "Thom M.", "AuthorID": "7004423623", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "7403429681": {"Name": "Scott C.", "AuthorID": "7403429681", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "8906436400": {"Name": "Thijs R.", "AuthorID": "8906436400", "AffiliationID": "60027759", "AffiliationName": "Stichting Epilepsie Instellingen Nederland (SEIN), Heemstede"}}}
