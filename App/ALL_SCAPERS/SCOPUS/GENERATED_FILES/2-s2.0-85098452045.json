Deficits in emotion regulation are implicated in a wide range of psychopathologies. It is argued that interpersonal, socio-cognitive, and developmental variables play an important role in ER. This is the first study to explore the contribution of individual differences in internal representations of relationships (IRR) to neural correlates of ER in a sample of adolescents. Event related potentials of 53 adolescents (12 to 17 years old) were collected while performing an ER task. IRR was assessed with the social cognition and object relations scale (SCORS-G; Westen, 1995) coding of narratives from interviews. Results show that individual differences in IRR significantly predicted the modulation of emotional responses by expressive suppression in adolescents, accounting for 48% of the variance of changes in occipital late positive potentials (LPP). Thus, it appears that IRR are implicated in an individual's ability to regulate emotions. The clinical implications of the findings are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Expressive suppression", "Internal working model", "Late positive potential", "Object relations", "Response modulation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85098452045", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"56919732200": {"Name": "Desatnik A.", "AuthorID": "56919732200", "AffiliationID": "60170329", "AffiliationName": "Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}, "57220037909": {"Name": "Taylor L.", "AuthorID": "57220037909", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London and the Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}, "57215570165": {"Name": "Fonagy P.", "AuthorID": "57215570165", "AffiliationID": "60170329", "AffiliationName": "Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}, "7003273958": {"Name": "Fearon P.", "AuthorID": "7003273958", "AffiliationID": "60170329", "AffiliationName": "Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}, "16300601400": {"Name": "Bel-Bahar T.", "AuthorID": "16300601400", "AffiliationID": "60029358", "AffiliationName": "Division of Translational Epidemiology, New York State Psychiatric Institute"}, "36017210900": {"Name": "Nolte T.", "AuthorID": "36017210900", "AffiliationID": "60170329", "AffiliationName": "Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}, "7103054032": {"Name": "Crowley M.J.", "AuthorID": "7103054032", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Child Study Centre, Yale University"}}}
