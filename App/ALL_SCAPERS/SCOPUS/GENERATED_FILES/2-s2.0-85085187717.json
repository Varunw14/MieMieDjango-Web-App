An accurate phylogenetic tree underpins our understanding of the major transitions in evolution, such as the emergence of new body plans or metabolism, and is key to inferring the origin of new genes, detecting molecular adaptation, understanding morphological character evolution and reconstructing demographic changes in recently diverged species. Although data are ever more plentiful and powerful analysis methods are available, there remain many challenges to reliable tree building. Here, we discuss the major steps of phylogenetic analysis, including identification of orthologous genes or proteins, multiple sequence alignment, and choice of substitution models and inference methodologies. Understanding the different sources of errors and the strategies to mitigate them is essential for assembling an accurate tree of life.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Computational Biology", "Crosses, Genetic", "Databases, Genetic", "Evolution, Molecular", "Genetic Heterogeneity", "Genome", "Genomics", "Humans", "Models, Genetic", "Phylogeny"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085187717", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"24537586400": {"Name": "Kapli P.", "AuthorID": "24537586400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Life\u2019s Origins and Evolution, Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "8148132700": {"Name": "Yang Z.", "AuthorID": "8148132700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Life\u2019s Origins and Evolution, Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "35546357100": {"Name": "Telford M.J.", "AuthorID": "35546357100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Life\u2019s Origins and Evolution, Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}}}
