The current study examined whether social communication characteristics present in middle childhood (ages 8\u201314) were associated with eating disorder behaviors, cognitions, and diagnoses across adolescence (ages 14\u201318) in a large, population-based sample. Participants (N = 4864) were children enrolled in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a population-based, prospective study of women and their children. Regression methods tested prospective associations between social functioning using a facial emotion recognition task and parentally reported social communication symptoms (or difficulties), measured by the Social Communication Disorder Checklist (SCDC), with eating disorder symptoms and diagnoses. Misattribution of faces as sad or angry at age 8.5 was associated with purging and anorexia nervosa diagnosis at age 14, respectively, among girls. Furthermore, autistic-like social communication difficulties during middle childhood were associated with bulimia nervosa symptoms during adolescence among both girls and boys. Results did not support global associations between measured social communication deficits and eating disorder risk in this sample, but specific difficulties with facial emotion recognition and social communication may enhance the risk for disordered eating behaviors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ALSPAC", "Eating disorder", "Social communication"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092674285", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"22942227800": {"Name": "Schaumberg K.", "AuthorID": "22942227800", "AffiliationID": "60032179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Wisconsin"}, "6507558619": {"Name": "Zerwas S.C.", "AuthorID": "6507558619", "AffiliationID": "60025111", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}, "56827294000": {"Name": "Bulik C.M.", "AuthorID": "56827294000", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet"}, "56651041000": {"Name": "Fiorentini C.", "AuthorID": "56651041000", "AffiliationID": "60004718, 60026405", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva"}, "16031429800": {"Name": "Micali N.", "AuthorID": "16031429800", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
