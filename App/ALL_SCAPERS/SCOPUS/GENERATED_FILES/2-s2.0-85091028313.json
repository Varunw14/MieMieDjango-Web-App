In this work, we report exact tunable frequency synthesis and phase control of a terahertz laser. The terahertz laser is locked by a terahertz injection phase lock loop for the first time, with the terahertz signal generated by heterodyning selected lines from an all-fiber infrared frequency comb generator in an ultrafast photodetector. The comb line frequency separation is exactly determined by a Global Positioning System-locked microwave frequency synthesizer, providing traceability of the terahertz laser frequency to primary standards. The locking technique reduced the heterodyne linewidth of the terahertz laser to a measurement instrument-limited linewidth of <1 Hz, robust against short- and long-term environmental fluctuations. The terahertz laser frequency can be tuned in increments determined only by the microwave synthesizer resolution, and the phase of the laser, relative to the reference, is independently and precisely controlled within a range \u00b10.3\u03c0. These findings are expected to enable applications in phase-resolved high-precision terahertz gas spectroscopy and radiometry.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Environmental fluctuations", "High-resolution spectroscopy", "Infrared frequencies", "Measurement instruments", "Microwave synthesizers", "Phase lock loop (PLL)", "Primary standards", "Terahertz signals"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091028313", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"56374134700": {"Name": "Mohandas R.A.", "AuthorID": "56374134700", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "8605376300": {"Name": "Li L.", "AuthorID": "8605376300", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "7201481463": {"Name": "Dean P.", "AuthorID": "7201481463", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "7005415578": {"Name": "Linfield E.H.", "AuthorID": "7005415578", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "56911604400": {"Name": "Davies A.G.", "AuthorID": "56911604400", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "25921429900": {"Name": "Freeman J.R.", "AuthorID": "25921429900", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "8276654100": {"Name": "Ponnampalam L.", "AuthorID": "8276654100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004751445": {"Name": "Seeds A.J.", "AuthorID": "7004751445", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
