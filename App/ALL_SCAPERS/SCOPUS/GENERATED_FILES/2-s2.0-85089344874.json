SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: A broad range of survival rates have been described for adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of Vater, presumably due to morphological heterogeneity which is a result of the different epitheliums ampullary adenocarcinoma can arise from (intestinal or pancreaticobiliary). Large series with homogenous patient selection are scarce. METHODS: A retrospective multicenter cohort analysis of patients who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy for ampullary adenocarcinoma in 9 European tertiary referral centers between February 2006 and December 2017 was performed. Collected data included demographics, histopathologic details, survival, and recurrence. OS and DFS analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: Overall, 887 patients were included, with a mean age of 66 \u00b1 10 years. The median OS was 64 months with 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year OS rates of 89%, 63%, 52%, and 37%, respectively. Histopathologic subtype, differentiation grade, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, T-stage, N-stage, resection margin, and adjuvant chemotherapy were correlated with OS and DFS. N-stage (HR = 3.30 [2.09-5.21]), perineural invasion (HR = 1.50 [1.01-2.23]), and adjuvant chemotherapy (HR = 0.69 [0.48-0.97]) were independent predictors of OS in multivariable analysis, whereas DFS was only adversely predicted by N-stage (HR = 2.65 [1.65-4.27]). CONCLUSIONS: Independent predictors of OS in resected ampullary cancer were N-stage, perineural invasion, and adjuvant chemotherapy. N-stage was the only predictor of DFS. These findings improve predicting survival and recurrence after resection of ampullary adenocarcinoma.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adenocarcinoma", "Aged", "Ampulla of Vater", "Cohort Studies", "Common Bile Duct Diseases", "Disease-Free Survival", "Female", "Humans", "International Cooperation", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Recurrence, Local", "Pancreaticoduodenectomy", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Retrospective Studies", "Survival Rate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089344874", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"]], "AuthorData": {"56674630600": {"Name": "Moekotte A.L.", "AuthorID": "56674630600", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, University Hospital of Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57204103379": {"Name": "Lof S.", "AuthorID": "57204103379", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, University Hospital of Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57210378016": {"Name": "Abu Hilal M.", "AuthorID": "57210378016", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, University Hospital of Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56725803500": {"Name": "Van Roessel S.", "AuthorID": "56725803500", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Cancer Center Amsterdam, University of Amsterdam"}, "6603166269": {"Name": "Besselink M.G.", "AuthorID": "6603166269", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Cancer Center Amsterdam, University of Amsterdam"}, "55532614000": {"Name": "Fontana M.", "AuthorID": "55532614000", "AffiliationID": "60060733", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, University Hospital of Verona"}, "57202649650": {"Name": "Casciani F.", "AuthorID": "57202649650", "AffiliationID": "60060733", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, University Hospital of Verona"}, "6701399875": {"Name": "Salvia R.", "AuthorID": "6701399875", "AffiliationID": "60060733", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, University Hospital of Verona"}, "57192070519": {"Name": "Dreyer S.", "AuthorID": "57192070519", "AffiliationID": "60018058", "AffiliationName": "West of Scotland Pancreatic Unit"}, "7004717554": {"Name": "Jamieson N.B.", "AuthorID": "7004717554", "AffiliationID": "60018058", "AffiliationName": "West of Scotland Pancreatic Unit"}, "24173903400": {"Name": "Shablak A.", "AuthorID": "24173903400", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, University Hospital of Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35174855700": {"Name": "Mavroeidis V.K.", "AuthorID": "35174855700", "AffiliationID": "60170323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603059226": {"Name": "Soonawalla Z.", "AuthorID": "6603059226", "AffiliationID": "60170323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "25960350600": {"Name": "Robinson S.", "AuthorID": "25960350600", "AffiliationID": "60001239", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35447245200": {"Name": "White S.", "AuthorID": "35447245200", "AffiliationID": "60001239", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57201802943": {"Name": "Khalil K.", "AuthorID": "57201802943", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Birmingham"}, "26428882000": {"Name": "Roberts K.", "AuthorID": "26428882000", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Birmingham"}, "56014198900": {"Name": "Gradinariu G.", "AuthorID": "56014198900", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "25629557900": {"Name": "Fusai G.K.", "AuthorID": "25629557900", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55651568800": {"Name": "Mowbray N.", "AuthorID": "55651568800", "AffiliationID": "60031920", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Morriston Hospital"}, "8740384800": {"Name": "Al-Sarireh B.", "AuthorID": "8740384800", "AffiliationID": "60031920", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Morriston Hospital"}}}
