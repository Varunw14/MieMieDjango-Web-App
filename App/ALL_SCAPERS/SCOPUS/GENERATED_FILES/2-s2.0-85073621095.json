Wettability-patterned surfaces inspired by natural structures have been extensively researched and could be a great potential avenue for easing water shortage. However, preparation strategies for these nature-inspired cases, including UV irradiation with mask technology, femtosecond laser direct writing and chemical treatment, are time-consuming, cost-ineffective and environmentally unfriendly. In this paper, robust and durable superhydrophobic (SHB) glass substrate was prepared by using laser-induced backward transfer technique and fluoroalkylsilane modification. Then wedge-shaped superhydrophilic (SHL) patterns on the SHB surfaces were rapidly constructed by inexpensive and commercially available fibre laser ablation for fog harvesting. This facile, cost-effective and non-corrosive preparation method described herein could be an alternative way to construct SHL\u2013SHB patterns on glass substrate, which could be used for microfluidic devices, droplet manipulation and cell screening.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Chemical treatments", "Droplet manipulation", "Fluoroalkylsilanes", "Laser direct writing", "Micro-fluidic devices", "Natural structures", "Preparation method", "Transfer technique"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073621095", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"57206851329": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "57206851329", "AffiliationID": "60004538, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Precision and Non-traditional Machining Technology of the Ministry of Education, Dalian University of Technology"}, "57208729167": {"Name": "Zhang Z.", "AuthorID": "57208729167", "AffiliationID": "60004538, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Precision and Non-traditional Machining Technology of the Ministry of Education, Dalian University of Technology"}, "57132535300": {"Name": "Liu J.", "AuthorID": "57132535300", "AffiliationID": "60004538, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Precision and Non-traditional Machining Technology of the Ministry of Education, Dalian University of Technology"}, "57204903187": {"Name": "Chen Y.", "AuthorID": "57204903187", "AffiliationID": "60004538, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Precision and Non-traditional Machining Technology of the Ministry of Education, Dalian University of Technology"}, "57221421947": {"Name": "Liu X.", "AuthorID": "57221421947", "AffiliationID": "60004538, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Precision and Non-traditional Machining Technology of the Ministry of Education, Dalian University of Technology"}, "56263826400": {"Name": "Chen F.", "AuthorID": "56263826400", "AffiliationID": "60019533, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Mechanism Theory and Equipment Design of Ministry of Education, Tianjin University"}, "57206597914": {"Name": "Lu Y.", "AuthorID": "57206597914", "AffiliationID": "60105356, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, Queen Mary University of London"}, "55924108500": {"Name": "Yang X.", "AuthorID": "55924108500", "AffiliationID": "60021666", "AffiliationName": "National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Helicopter Transmission, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics"}, "7003437916": {"Name": "Carmalt C.J.", "AuthorID": "7003437916", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
