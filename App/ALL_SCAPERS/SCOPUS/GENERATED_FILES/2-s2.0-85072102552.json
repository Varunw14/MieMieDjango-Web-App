Solid boundaries can strongly influence a cell\u2019s propulsion mechanism, thus leading many flagellated bacteria to describe long circular trajectories stably entrapped by the surface. Experimental studies on near-surface bacterial motility have, however, neglected the fact that real environments have typical microstructures varying on the scale of the cells\u2019 motion. Here, we show that micro-obstacles influence the propagation of peritrichously flagellated bacteria on a flat surface in a non-monotonic way. Instead of hindering it, an optimal, relatively low obstacle density can significantly enhance cells\u2019 propagation on surfaces due to individual forward-scattering events. This finding provides insight on the emerging dynamics of chiral active matter in complex environments and inspires possible routes to control microbial ecology in natural habitats.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Computer Simulation", "Escherichia coli", "Movement", "Probability", "Surface Properties"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072102552", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57210976511": {"Name": "Makarchuk S.", "AuthorID": "57210976511", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55391086000": {"Name": "Volpe G.", "AuthorID": "55391086000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57210977372": {"Name": "Braz V.", "AuthorID": "57210977372", "AffiliationID": "60002769, 60106051", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de F\u00edsica, Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias, Universidade de Lisboa"}, "13607656900": {"Name": "Ara\u00fajo N.", "AuthorID": "13607656900", "AffiliationID": "60002769, 60106051", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de F\u00edsica, Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias, Universidade de Lisboa"}, "18435943500": {"Name": "Ciric L.", "AuthorID": "18435943500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
