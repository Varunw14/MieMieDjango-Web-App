This study assessed functional and hemodynamic changes induced by the device. Twenty-one patients with resistant and/or uncontrolled hypertension underwent stress echocardiography and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) at baseline and 6 months post-coupler implantation. End points were selected to best evaluate cardiac function including Doppler stroke volume (SV), septal and lateral E/E\u2032, and right ventricular systolic velocity S\u2032 (RV S\u2032). CPET VO2 peak demonstrated total cardiopulmonary performance. SV increased from 76.4 SD12.2 mL to 92.1 SD22.7 mL 6 months post-coupler insertion; P =.002. No changes in RV S\u2032, septal or lateral E/E\u2032, or VO2 peak were observed. Five patients experienced increased diuretic requirement \u22653 times baseline. RV S\u2032 fell from 19.0 SD1.87 cm/s to 16.80 SD3.43 cm/s in these patients (P '.05). A significant increase in SV 6 months post-coupler insertion was observed. In patients with increased diuretic requirement, the device was associated with a lower RV S\u2032 suggesting occult RV dysfunction as the mechanism of this pre-specified adverse outcome.", "AuthorKeywords": ["advanced echocardiography", "cardiopulmonary exercise testing", "hypertension", "iliac arteriovenous fistula"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Arteriovenous Anastomosis", "Arteriovenous Shunt, Surgical", "Blood Pressure", "Blood Pressure Determination", "Coronary Vasospasm", "Echocardiography", "Echocardiography, Stress", "Exercise Test", "Female", "Hemodynamics", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Iliac Artery", "Iliac Vein", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Safety", "Stroke Volume", "Systole", "Ventricular Function, Right"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072509808", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"26644757600": {"Name": "Eysenck W.", "AuthorID": "26644757600", "AffiliationID": "60013181", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Research Department, Eastbourne General Hospital"}, "57190162808": {"Name": "van Zalen J.", "AuthorID": "57190162808", "AffiliationID": "60013181", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Research Department, Eastbourne General Hospital"}, "7004099203": {"Name": "Furniss S.", "AuthorID": "7004099203", "AffiliationID": "60013181", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Research Department, Eastbourne General Hospital"}, "7004131426": {"Name": "Sulke N.", "AuthorID": "7004131426", "AffiliationID": "60013181", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Research Department, Eastbourne General Hospital"}, "57204674407": {"Name": "Freemantle N.", "AuthorID": "57204674407", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology, University College London"}, "55645073800": {"Name": "Lloyd G.", "AuthorID": "55645073800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, UCL"}}}
