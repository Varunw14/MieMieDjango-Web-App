In long-term care facilities, levels of inappropriate prescribing are as high as 75%. Numerous interventions targeting long-term care facilities' antimicrobial stewardship have been reported with varying, and largely unexplained, effects. Therefore, this review aimed to apply behavioural science frameworks to specify the component behaviour change techniques of stewardship interventions in long-term care facilities and identify those components associated with improved outcomes. Method: A systematic review (CRD42018103803) was conducted through electronic database searches. Two behavioural science frameworks, the Behaviour Change Wheel and Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy were used to classify intervention descriptions into intervention types and component behaviour change techniques used. Study design and outcome heterogeneity prevented meta-analysis and meta-regression. Interventions were categorised as 'very promising' (all outcomes statistically significant), 'quite promising' (some outcomes statistically significant), or 'not promising' (no outcomes statistically significant). 'Promise ratios' (PR) were calculated for identified intervention types and behaviour change techniques by dividing the number of (very or quite) promising interventions featuring the intervention type or behaviour change technique by the number of interventions featuring the intervention type or behaviour change technique that were not promising. Promising intervention types and behaviour change techniques were defined as those with a PR \u2265 2. Results: Twenty studies (of19 interventions) were included. Seven interventions (37%) were 'very promising', eight 'quite promising' (42%) and four 'not promising' (21%). Most promising intervention types were 'persuasion' (n = 12; promise ratio (PR) = 5.0), 'enablement' (n = 16; PR = 4.33) and 'education' (n = 19; PR = 3.75). Most promising behaviour change techniques were 'feedback on behaviour' (n = 9; PR = 8.0) and 'restructuring the social environment' (e.g. staff role changes; n = 8; PR = 7.0). Conclusion: Systematic identification of the active ingredients of antimicrobial stewardship in long-term care facilities was facilitated through the application of behavioural science frameworks. Incorporating environmental restructuring and performance feedback may be promising intervention strategies for antimicrobial stewardship interventions within long-term care facilities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antimicrobial stewardship", "Behavioural sciences", "Nursing homes", "Systematic review"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Behavior Therapy", "Humans", "Inappropriate Prescribing", "Long-Term Care", "Skilled Nursing Facilities"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087810952", "SubjectAreas": [["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"6507882522": {"Name": "Crayton E.", "AuthorID": "6507882522", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, Centre for Behaviour Change, University College London"}, "57217989199": {"Name": "Liu S.", "AuthorID": "57217989199", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, Centre for Behaviour Change, University College London"}, "57213007526": {"Name": "Forbes G.", "AuthorID": "57213007526", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, Centre for Behaviour Change, University College London"}, "57217993597": {"Name": "Anderson N.", "AuthorID": "57217993597", "AffiliationID": "60172638", "AffiliationName": "Health Protection Research Unit in Evaluation of Interventions, National Institute of Health Research (NIHR)"}, "7004779970": {"Name": "Michie S.", "AuthorID": "7004779970", "AffiliationID": "60172638", "AffiliationName": "Health Protection Research Unit in Evaluation of Interventions, National Institute of Health Research (NIHR)"}, "55361024100": {"Name": "Lorencatto F.", "AuthorID": "55361024100", "AffiliationID": "60172638", "AffiliationName": "Health Protection Research Unit in Evaluation of Interventions, National Institute of Health Research (NIHR)"}, "36053555200": {"Name": "Richardson M.", "AuthorID": "36053555200", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education (IOE), University College London"}, "16645266400": {"Name": "Fuller C.", "AuthorID": "16645266400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}, "57212329939": {"Name": "Smith C.", "AuthorID": "57212329939", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}, "35184065400": {"Name": "Shallcross L.", "AuthorID": "35184065400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}, "35944648500": {"Name": "Hayward A.", "AuthorID": "35944648500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Epidemiology and Health, University College London"}}}
