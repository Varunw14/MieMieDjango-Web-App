The designed phantoms comprise spherical scattering particles with fine-tuned size distributions and are capable of simultaneously reproducing spatially resolved intensity measurements and depolarization measurements of target media when illuminated with circularly polarized light.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Circular depolarization", "Circularly polarized light", "Colloidal suspensions", "Depolarization measurements", "Intensity measurements", "Scattering media", "Scattering particles", "Spatially resolved", "Animals", "Cattle", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Kidney Cortex", "Light", "Microscopy, Polarization", "Milk", "Phantoms, Imaging", "Scattering, Radiation", "Sheep"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076120805", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Engineering (miscellaneous)", "ENGI", "2201"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"37039602700": {"Name": "Macdonald C.M.", "AuthorID": "37039602700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57198779386": {"Name": "Kunnen B.", "AuthorID": "57198779386", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, UMC Utrecht"}, "6507676616": {"Name": "Stayner C.", "AuthorID": "6507676616", "AffiliationID": "60010296, 60017311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago"}, "7101690950": {"Name": "Eccles M.R.", "AuthorID": "7101690950", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Maurice Wilkins Centre for Molecular Biodiscovery"}}}
