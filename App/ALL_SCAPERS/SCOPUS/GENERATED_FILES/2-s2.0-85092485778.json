It is unclear if these responses can be further enhanced or sustained with reboosting strategies. Furthermore, despite the challenges involved in MVA manufacture dose de-escalation has not been performed in humans. In this study, healthy volunteers received chimpanzee-derived adenovirus-3 and MVA vaccines encoding the non-structural region of hepatitis C virus (ChAd3-NSmut/MVA-NSmut) 8 weeks apart. Volunteers were then reboosted with a second round of ChAd3-NSmut/MVA-NSmut or MVA-NSmut vaccines 8 weeks or 1-year later. We also determined the capacity of reduced doses of MVA-NSmut to boost ChAd3-NSmut primed T cells. Reboosting was safe, with no enhanced reactogenicity. Reboosting after an 8-week interval led to minimal re-expansion of transgene-specific T cells. However, after a longer interval, T cell responses expanded efficiently and memory responses were enhanced. The 8-week interval regimen induced a higher percentage of terminally differentiated and effector memory T cells. Reboosting with MVA-NSmut alone was as effective as with ChAd3-NSmut/MVA-NSmut. A ten-fold lower dose of MVA (2 \u00d7 107pfu) induced high-magnitude, sustained, broad, and functional Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-specific T cell responses, equivalent to standard doses (2 \u00d7 108 pfu). Overall, we show that following Ad/MVA prime-boost vaccination reboosting is most effective after a prolonged interval and is productive with MVA alone. Importantly, we also show that a ten-fold lower dose of MVA is as potent in humans as the standard dose.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092485778", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"7004007609": {"Name": "Capone S.", "AuthorID": "7004007609", "AffiliationID": "60159878", "AffiliationName": "ReiThera Srl"}, "56257486100": {"Name": "Sorbo M.D.", "AuthorID": "56257486100", "AffiliationID": "60159878", "AffiliationName": "ReiThera Srl"}, "7003664576": {"Name": "Traboni C.", "AuthorID": "7003664576", "AffiliationID": "120513092", "AffiliationName": "Nouscom Srl"}, "6603090064": {"Name": "Colloca S.", "AuthorID": "6603090064", "AffiliationID": "60159878", "AffiliationName": "ReiThera Srl"}, "7006727126": {"Name": "Cortese R.", "AuthorID": "7006727126", "AffiliationID": "60159878", "AffiliationName": "ReiThera Srl"}, "6603215719": {"Name": "Folgori A.", "AuthorID": "6603215719", "AffiliationID": "60159878", "AffiliationName": "ReiThera Srl"}, "55219821200": {"Name": "Brown A.", "AuthorID": "55219821200", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "57115462300": {"Name": "Hartnell F.", "AuthorID": "57115462300", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "57216302662": {"Name": "Klenerman P.", "AuthorID": "57216302662", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60175818", "AffiliationName": "The Jenner Institute, University of Oxford"}, "57200000008": {"Name": "Barnes E.", "AuthorID": "57200000008", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60175818", "AffiliationName": "The Jenner Institute, University of Oxford"}, "54882279100": {"Name": "Swadling L.", "AuthorID": "54882279100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Rayne Institute, University College London"}, "35618608000": {"Name": "Vassilev V.", "AuthorID": "35618608000", "AffiliationID": "60111446", "AffiliationName": "GSK Vaccines"}, "35509776500": {"Name": "Nicosia A.", "AuthorID": "35509776500", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine and Medical Biotechnology, University of Naples Federico II"}}}
