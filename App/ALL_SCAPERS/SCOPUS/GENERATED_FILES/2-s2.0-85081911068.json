Drawing on the literature and a Commercial Education Trust study of practices which encourage employer engagement in skills development, it is argued that \u2018putting skills to work\u2019 is not automatic or unproblematic. It is not simply a matter of \u2018skills transfer\u2019, but a \u2018continuous, contextually-embedded and transformative process\u2019 during which individuals, supported by partners, learn how to recontextualise skills to suit different activities and environments. It may be tempting to distil employability into a list of so-called \u2018soft skills\u2019, but context matters. It requires more than that which can be taught in Education. Support is needed in the workplace through mentoring, for example, to help recruits acquire knowledge of workplace culture, norms and practices, situational understanding, and apply metacognitive strategies for bringing together this knowledge and a range of different skills and personal attributes in productive application. Further research is needed to explore the inter-relationships between skills supply, demand and utilisation, including ways in which employers can better recognise young recruits\u2019 skills and provide \u2018expansive\u2019 working environments that maximise their capabilities and potential for development.", "AuthorKeywords": ["School-to-work transition", "skills transfer", "skills utilisation", "soft skills"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081911068", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Public Administration", "SOCI", "3321"], ["Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management", "BUSI", "1407"]], "AuthorData": {"57215773640": {"Name": "Fettes T.", "AuthorID": "57215773640", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Education and Industry, University of Warwick"}, "57201592972": {"Name": "Evans K.", "AuthorID": "57201592972", "AffiliationID": "60099154", "AffiliationName": "Academy of Social Sciences (FAcSS)"}, "57080100300": {"Name": "Kashefpakdel E.", "AuthorID": "57080100300", "AffiliationID": "100357093", "AffiliationName": "Research, Education and Employers"}}}
