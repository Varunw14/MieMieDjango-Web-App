Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Social participation is a modifiable determinant for health and wellbeing among older people; however, social participation is increasingly dependent on technology use. This study investigated social participation in relation to Everyday Technology use and social deprivation of the living environment, among older people with and without dementia in the United Kingdom. Sixty-four people with dementia and sixty-four people without dementia were interviewed using standardized questionnaires: The Participation in ACTivities and Places OUTside Home Questionnaire and Everyday Technology Use Questionnaire. A mixed methods approach integrated statistical analyses and content analysis of free-text responses, through data visualizations. Small, statistically significant associations were found between social participation and Everyday Technology use outside home, for participants with dementia (Rs = 0.247; p = 0.049) and without dementia (Rs = 0.343; p = 0.006). A small, statistically significant association was identified between social participation and social deprivation in the living environment, among only participants with dementia (Rs = 0.267, p = 0.033). The content analysis and graphical joint display revealed motivators, considerations that require extra attention, and strategies for managing social participation. The results underline how Everyday Technology use can be assistive to social participation but also the need to consider social deprivation of the living environment, especially among people with dementia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dementia", "Digital accessibility", "Information and communication technologies", "Social participation", "Technologies for aging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Dementia", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Social Participation", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Technology", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086354239", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis", "ENVI", "2307"]], "AuthorData": {"57204611837": {"Name": "Gaber S.N.", "AuthorID": "57204611837", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "16053021900": {"Name": "Nyg\u00e5rd L.", "AuthorID": "16053021900", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Division of Occupational Therapy, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet"}, "54381395300": {"Name": "Brorsson A.", "AuthorID": "54381395300", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Division of Occupational Therapy, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet"}, "6506079508": {"Name": "Kottorp A.", "AuthorID": "6506079508", "AffiliationID": "60007905", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Society, Malm\u00f6 University"}, "57204611027": {"Name": "Wallcook S.", "AuthorID": "57204611027", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "36548600200": {"Name": "Malinowsky C.", "AuthorID": "36548600200", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Division of Occupational Therapy, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet"}, "6602617245": {"Name": "Charlesworth G.", "AuthorID": "6602617245", "AffiliationID": "60107401", "AffiliationName": "Research and Development Department, North East London NHS Foundation Trust, Maggie Lilley Suite, Goodmayes Hospital"}}}
