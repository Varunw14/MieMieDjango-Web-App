Patients and Methods: From January 2009 to December 2019, we performed a prospective study of all patients with a suspected diagnosis of EPN referred to a specialist tertiary centre in South India. All patients who underwent non-contrast computed tomography of the abdomen and those diagnosed with EPN were included in this study. Demographic parameters, imaging, haematological and microbiology results were recorded. Patients were divided into three groups: Group 1, patients who survived without any intervention; Group 2, those who survived with surgical intervention; and Group 3, those who died with or without intervention. A prognostic scoring system was developed from 18 different parameters and risk stratification was developed. The scores were correlated with overall prognosis. Results: Data from 131 patients with EPN enrolled in the study were analysed: Group 1 (n = 22), Group 2 (n = 102) and Group 3 (n = 7). By using univariate analysis, 10 factors were identified to be significantly associated with prognosis. Diabetes mellitus was the most common comorbidity. Shock at initial admission indicated a poor prognosis and warranted immediate attention (P < 0.001). Conclusions: A multi-disciplinary approach, a high index of clinical suspicion, an early diagnosis and administration of culture-specific antibiotics with identification of prognostic indicators and risk stratification, allows prompt and appropriate medical and surgical treatments that could improve EPN management outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["#UroUTI", "diabetes mellitus", "emphysematous pyelonephritis", "haemodialysis", "nephrectomy", "percutaneous nephrostomy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092560435", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"36877652600": {"Name": "Krishnamoorthy S.", "AuthorID": "36877652600", "AffiliationID": "60023483", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology and Renal Transplantation, Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research"}, "57191169379": {"Name": "Sekar H.", "AuthorID": "57191169379", "AffiliationID": "60023483", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology and Renal Transplantation, Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research"}, "57191170478": {"Name": "Kumaresan N.", "AuthorID": "57191170478", "AffiliationID": "60023483", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology and Renal Transplantation, Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research"}, "57216109256": {"Name": "Zumla A.", "AuthorID": "57216109256", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre, UCL Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24339107700": {"Name": "Muneer A.", "AuthorID": "24339107700", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science UCL, Department of Urology and NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, UCL Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57217345351": {"Name": "Thiruvengadam G.", "AuthorID": "57217345351", "AffiliationID": "60023483", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bio-Statistics, Faculty of Allied Health Science, Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education & Research"}}}
