All rights reserved.Background and Purpose-Widespread reductions in white matter integrity are associated with cognitive dysfunction in sickle cell anemia. Silent cerebral infarction (SCI), vasculopathy (VSC), and low hemoglobin concentration (Hb) are implicated; we aimed to determine independent contributions to microstructural white matter injury and whether white matter integrity differs across arterial territories. Methods-Sixty two children with sickle cell anemia aged 6 to 19 years were prospectively studied at Muhimbili National Hospital, Tanzania. SCI\u00b1 and VSC\u00b1 were identified on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) scans by 2 neuroradiologists. Tract-based spatial statistics tested for voxel-wise differences in diffusion tensor imaging metrics (ie, fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity) between SCI\u00b1 and VSC\u00b1 groups, with correlations between diffusion tensor imaging metrics and Hb. In tract-based spatial statistics analyses, potentially mediating factors (ie, age, sex, as well as Hb, SCI, and/or vasculopathy) were covariates. Differences in mean diffusion tensor imaging metrics across regions of interest in arterial territories were explored. Results-Compared with SCI-patients (n=45), SCI+ patients (n=17) exhibited increased radial diffusivity in multiple regions; negative relationships were observed between mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and Hb (P<0.005). Compared with VSC-patients (n=49), mild (n=6) or moderate (n=7) VSC+ patients exhibited reduced fractional anisotropy in widespread regions (P<0.05) including the anterior longitudinal fasciculi, corpus callosum, internal capsule, corona radiata, and corticospinal tracts. Overall, the posterior cerebral arterial territory had higher mean mean diffusivity and mean radial diffusivity than the anterior and middle cerebral arterial territories, although no patient had vasculopathy in this area. There was an interaction between territory and vasculopathy. Conclusions-SCI, vasculopathy, and Hb are independent risk factors, and thus treatment targets, for diffuse white matter injury in patients with sickle cell anemia. Exacerbation of hemodynamic stress may play a role.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anemia", "anisotropy", "hemoglobin", "magnetic resonance angiography", "magnetic resonance imaging", "sickle cell"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Anemia, Sickle Cell", "Brain", "Child", "Diffusion Tensor Imaging", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Angiography", "Male", "Prospective Studies", "Tanzania", "White Matter", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082342451", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Advanced and Specialized Nursing", "NURS", "2902"]], "AuthorData": {"57211131675": {"Name": "Jacob M.", "AuthorID": "57211131675", "AffiliationID": "60091726", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Imaging, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences"}, "57200801395": {"Name": "Makani J.", "AuthorID": "57200801395", "AffiliationID": "124314714", "AffiliationName": "Muhimbili Sickle Cell Program, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences"}, "6506058549": {"Name": "Kazema R.", "AuthorID": "6506058549", "AffiliationID": "124314714", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical Microbiology, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences"}, "57215908570": {"Name": "Chamba C.", "AuthorID": "57215908570", "AffiliationID": "124314714", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology and Blood Transfusion, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences"}, "57196455905": {"Name": "Stotesbury H.", "AuthorID": "57196455905", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neurosciences Section, Ucl Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "55444368100": {"Name": "Kawadler J.M.", "AuthorID": "55444368100", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neurosciences Section, Ucl Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "57215907883": {"Name": "Lapadaire W.", "AuthorID": "57215907883", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neurosciences Section, Ucl Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "26643012600": {"Name": "Kirkham F.J.", "AuthorID": "26643012600", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Unit, Ucl Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "55290679000": {"Name": "Clark C.A.", "AuthorID": "55290679000", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neurosciences Section, Ucl Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "7202074854": {"Name": "Saunders D.E.", "AuthorID": "7202074854", "AffiliationID": "60000703, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Experimental Sciences, University Hospital Southampton Nhs Foundation Trust, University of Southampton"}, "35071951600": {"Name": "Sangeda R.Z.", "AuthorID": "35071951600", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "King's College Hospital"}}}
