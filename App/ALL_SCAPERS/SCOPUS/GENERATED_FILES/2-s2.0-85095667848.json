All rights reserved.Humans create metacognitive beliefs about their performance across many levels of abstraction\u2014from local confidence in individual decisions to global estimates of our skills and abilities. Despite a rich literature on the neural basis of local confidence judgements, how global self-performance estimates (SPEs) are constructed remains unknown. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we scanned human subjects while they performed several short blocks of tasks and reported on which task they think they performed best, providing a behavioral proxy for global SPEs. In a frontoparietal network sensitive to fluctuations in local confidence, we found that activity within ventromedial prefrontal cortex and precuneus was additionally modulated by global SPEs. In contrast, activity in ventral striatum was associated with subjects\u2019 global SPEs irrespective of fluctuations in local confidence, and predicted the extent to which global SPEs tracked objective task difficulty across individuals. Our findings reveal neural representations of global SPEs that go beyond the tracking of local confidence, and lay the groundwork for understanding how a formation of global self-beliefs may go awry in conditions characterized by distorted self-evaluation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Confidence", "FMRI", "Metacognition", "Self-efficacy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Cognition", "Decision Making", "Female", "Humans", "Judgment", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Metacognition", "Motivation", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Psychomotor Performance", "Self Concept", "Ventral Striatum"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095667848", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57200631711": {"Name": "Rouault M.", "AuthorID": "57200631711", "AffiliationID": "60000179, 60108665", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cognitive Studies, Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, Paris Sciences et Lettres University"}, "35068005100": {"Name": "Fleming S.M.", "AuthorID": "35068005100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}}}
