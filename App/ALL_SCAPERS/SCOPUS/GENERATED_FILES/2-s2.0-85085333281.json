Three parasitic infections \u2014 cerebral malaria, Taenia solium cysticercosis and onchocerciasis \u2014 have an established association with epilepsy. Parasitoses are widely prevalent in low-income and middle-income countries, which are home to 80% of the people with epilepsy in the world. Once a parasitic infection has taken hold in the brain, therapeutic measures do not seem to influence the development of epilepsy in the long term. Consequently, strategies to control, eliminate and eradicate parasites represent the most feasible way to reduce the epilepsy burden at present. The elucidation of immune mechanisms underpinning the parasitic infections, some of which are parasite-specific, opens up new therapeutic possibilities. In this Review, we explore the pathophysiological basis of the link between parasitic infections and epilepsy, and we consider preventive and therapeutic approaches to reduce the burden of epilepsy attributable to parasitic disorders. We conclude that a concerted approach involving medical, veterinary, parasitological and ecological experts, backed by robust political support and sustainable funding, is the key to reducing this burden.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085333281", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"57199952188": {"Name": "Singh G.", "AuthorID": "57199952188", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "NIHR University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "25521358700": {"Name": "Angwafor S.A.", "AuthorID": "25521358700", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "NIHR University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "57188659835": {"Name": "Sander J.W.", "AuthorID": "57188659835", "AffiliationID": "60027759", "AffiliationName": "Stichting Epilepsie Instellingen Nederland (SEIN)"}, "12775905900": {"Name": "Njamnshi A.K.", "AuthorID": "12775905900", "AffiliationID": "120436263", "AffiliationName": "Brain Research Africa Initiative (BRAIN), Geneva, Switzerland and Yaound\u00e9"}, "6701464223": {"Name": "Fraimow H.", "AuthorID": "6701464223", "AffiliationID": "60014089", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Cooper Medical School of Rowan University"}}}
