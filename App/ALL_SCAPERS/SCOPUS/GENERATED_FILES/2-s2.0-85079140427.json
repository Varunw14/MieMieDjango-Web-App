An accurate cleaner selection method will help keep satisfying indoor air quality, as well as reducing cost and materials of equipment. Three key parameters, namely, air exchange rate (a), particle penetration factor (P) and deposition rate (k), have been suggested as direct influence on air cleaner selection when pollutants are coming from building infiltration. In relevant standards, however, there is no method that can link the three key parameters to various airtightness levels of external windows, which may often exist in real applications. This study, therefore, has proposed a calculation method for deciding a, P and k, based on monitored indoor and outdoor PM2.5 mass concentrations, with given recommended design values under different external window airtightness levels. Results showed that both air exchange rates and penetration factors were significantly influenced by the airtightness level of windows, and both their values were found to be different from the recommended values in the current Chinese standard, providing evidence to support future standard revision and update. Meanwhile, deposition rates showed good agreement with the recommended value in the current Chinese standard (i.e. 0.2h\u22121). Additionally, with increased window airtightness level, the required clean air delivery rate (CADR) of air cleaners showed a downward trend, which means an air cleaner with smaller size, lower energy consumption and less material.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Air cleaner", "Air exchange rate", "Deposition rate", "Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution", "Penetration factor", "Window airtightness level"], "IndexKeywords": ["Air exchange rates", "Airtightness", "Fine particulate matter (PM2.5)", "Indoor air quality", "Particle penetration", "Penetration factor", "Residential application", "Standard revisions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079140427", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"]], "AuthorData": {"55866938600": {"Name": "Chen Z.", "AuthorID": "55866938600", "AffiliationID": "60104684", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Building Environment and Energy Efficiency, China Academy of Building Research"}, "57215375495": {"Name": "Chen C.", "AuthorID": "57215375495", "AffiliationID": "60022281", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Green Built Environment and Energy Efficient Technology Beijing, Beijing University of Technology"}, "56526867000": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "56526867000", "AffiliationID": "60022281", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Green Built Environment and Energy Efficient Technology Beijing, Beijing University of Technology"}, "57214796198": {"Name": "Liu Z.", "AuthorID": "57214796198", "AffiliationID": "60104684", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Building Environment and Energy Efficiency, China Academy of Building Research"}, "55239360900": {"Name": "Cao G.", "AuthorID": "55239360900", "AffiliationID": "60104684", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Building Environment and Energy Efficiency, China Academy of Building Research"}, "56163657100": {"Name": "Li G.", "AuthorID": "56163657100", "AffiliationID": "60104684", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Building Environment and Energy Efficiency, China Academy of Building Research"}, "57214795764": {"Name": "Zhu J.", "AuthorID": "57214795764", "AffiliationID": "60104684", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Building Environment and Energy Efficiency, China Academy of Building Research"}, "57214803811": {"Name": "Ma Y.", "AuthorID": "57214803811", "AffiliationID": "60104684", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Building Environment and Energy Efficiency, China Academy of Building Research"}, "55504215000": {"Name": "Wei S.", "AuthorID": "55504215000", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London (UCL)"}, "57196458039": {"Name": "Du Y.", "AuthorID": "57196458039", "AffiliationID": "60008592", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"}}}
