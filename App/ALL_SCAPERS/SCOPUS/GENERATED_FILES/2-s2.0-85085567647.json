No specific treatments for reducing mortality or morbidity are yet available. Deaths from COVID-19 will continue to rise globally until effective and appropriate treatments and/or vaccines are found. In search of effective treatments, the global medical, scientific, pharma and funding communities have rapidly initiated over 500 COVID-19 clinical trials on a range of antiviral drug regimens and repurposed drugs in various combinations. A paradigm shift is underway from the current focus of drug development targeting the pathogen, to advancing cellular Host-Directed Therapies (HDTs) for tackling the aberrant host immune and inflammatory responses which underlie the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and high COVID-19 mortality rates. We focus this editorial specifically on the background to, and the rationale for, the use and evaluation of mesenchymal stromal (Stem) cells (MSCs) in treatment trials of patients with severe COVID-19 disease. Currently, the ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) report a combined 28 trials exploring the potential of MSCs or their products for treatment of COVID-19. MSCs should also be trialed for treatment of other circulating WHO priority Blueprint pathogens such as MERS-CoV which causes upto 34% mortality rates. It's about time funding agencies invested more into development MSCs per se, and also for a range of other HDTs, in combination with other therapeutic interventions. MSC therapy could turn out to be an important contribution to bringing an end to the high COVID-19 death rates and preventing long-term functional disability in those who survive disease.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Betacoronavirus", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Consensus", "Coronavirus Infections", "Humans", "Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation", "Morbidity", "Pandemics", "Pneumonia, Viral"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085567647", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57216109256": {"Name": "Zumla A.", "AuthorID": "57216109256", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, and National Institutes of Health and Research Biomedical Research Centre, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55569193600": {"Name": "Wang F.S.", "AuthorID": "55569193600", "AffiliationID": "60069744", "AffiliationName": "Treatment and Research Center for Infectious Diseases, The Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases"}, "57216970005": {"Name": "Chang C.", "AuthorID": "57216970005", "AffiliationID": "60069744", "AffiliationName": "Treatment and Research Center for Infectious Diseases, The Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases"}, "57208096848": {"Name": "Ippolito G.", "AuthorID": "57208096848", "AffiliationID": "60072494", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani - IRCCS"}, "57202570507": {"Name": "Petrosillo N.", "AuthorID": "57202570507", "AffiliationID": "60072494", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani - IRCCS"}, "6601911681": {"Name": "Agrati C.", "AuthorID": "6601911681", "AffiliationID": "60072494", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani - IRCCS"}, "23090055800": {"Name": "Azhar E.I.", "AuthorID": "23090055800", "AffiliationID": "60004582", "AffiliationName": "King Fahd Medical Research Center [KFMRC], Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, King Abdulaziz University"}, "12545932500": {"Name": "El-Kafrawy S.A.", "AuthorID": "12545932500", "AffiliationID": "60004582", "AffiliationName": "King Fahd Medical Research Center [KFMRC], Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, King Abdulaziz University"}, "57212430874": {"Name": "Osman M.", "AuthorID": "57212430874", "AffiliationID": "60071723, 60016418", "AffiliationName": "Emerging and Re-Emerging Diseases, University of Khartoum, Sudan and York Biomedical Research Institute, University of York"}, "56036764300": {"Name": "Zitvogel L.", "AuthorID": "56036764300", "AffiliationID": "112492570", "AffiliationName": "OncoImmunology Programms, Gustave Roussy Cancer Center (GRCC)"}, "35373462100": {"Name": "Galle P.R.", "AuthorID": "35373462100", "AffiliationID": "60022135", "AffiliationName": "I Medical Clinic, University Medical Center Mainz"}, "7202821559": {"Name": "Locatelli F.", "AuthorID": "7202821559", "AffiliationID": "60032350, 60017905", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, IRCCS Ospedale Bambino Gesu, and Sapienza, University of Rome"}, "57216969770": {"Name": "Gorman E.", "AuthorID": "57216969770", "AffiliationID": "60008028", "AffiliationName": "Regional Intensive Care Unit, Royal Victoria Hospital"}, "8941858200": {"Name": "O'Kane C.", "AuthorID": "8941858200", "AffiliationID": "60008028", "AffiliationName": "Regional Intensive Care Unit, Royal Victoria Hospital"}, "7004946375": {"Name": "McAuley D.", "AuthorID": "7004946375", "AffiliationID": "60008028", "AffiliationName": "Regional Intensive Care Unit, Royal Victoria Hospital"}, "57205281879": {"Name": "Cordon-Cardo C.", "AuthorID": "57205281879", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Pathology, Molecular and Cell Based Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}, "7004422039": {"Name": "Maeurer M.", "AuthorID": "7004422039", "AffiliationID": "60031216", "AffiliationName": "Champalimaud Centre, Lisbon, Portugal and Med Clinic, University of Mainz"}}}
