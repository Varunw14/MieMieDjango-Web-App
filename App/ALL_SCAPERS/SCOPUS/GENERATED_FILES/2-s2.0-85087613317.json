In this paper, we evaluate quality indicators in subtitling as perceived by professional subtitlers and viewers. After exploring the various subtitle parameters that can have an impact on the quality of the end product (such as line breaks, synchronisation, display rates), we present the results of two qualitative studies conducted with professional subtitlers and subtitle viewers with different audiovisual backgrounds. The results yield some similarities and discrepancies, particularly in the way in which the strategy of condensation is perceived by the two groups, and they also help delineate the subtitle parameters that should be taken into consideration in order to improve the creative process as well as the reception of subtitles.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Audiovisual translation", "Line breaks", "Quality", "Subtitle display rates", "Subtitlers", "Subtitling", "Viewers"], "IndexKeywords": ["Creative process", "End-products", "Qualitative study", "Quality indicators"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087613317", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"54416458200": {"Name": "Szarkowska A.", "AuthorID": "54416458200", "AffiliationID": "60110610, 60013756", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Linguistics, University of Warsaw"}, "55833672400": {"Name": "D\u00edaz Cintas J.", "AuthorID": "55833672400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Translation Studies (CenTraS), University College London"}, "57202588774": {"Name": "Gerber-Mor\u00f3n O.", "AuthorID": "57202588774", "AffiliationID": "101492441", "AffiliationName": null}}}
