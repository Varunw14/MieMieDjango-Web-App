There are no treatments for patients suffering from bestrophinopathies, and no measures can be taken to prevent visual deterioration in those who have inherited disease-causing mutations. Bestrophinopathies are caused by mutations in the Bestrophin1 gene (BEST1), a protein found exclusively in the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells of the eye. Mutations in BEST1 affect the function of the RPE leading to the death of overlying retinal cells and subsequent vision loss. The pathogenic mechanisms arising from BEST1 mutations are still not fully understood, and it is not clear how mutations in BEST1 lead to diseases with distinct clinical features. This chapter discusses BEST1, the use of model systems to investigate the effects of mutations and the potential to investigate individual bestrophinopathies using induced pluripotent stem cells.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BEST1", "Bestrophinopathies", "Induced pluripotent stem cells", "Macula", "RPE"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bestrophins", "Chloride Channels", "Eye Proteins", "Humans", "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Mutation", "Retinal Diseases", "Retinal Pigment Epithelium"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077335861", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"57212677719": {"Name": "Smith J.J.", "AuthorID": "57212677719", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "56444492500": {"Name": "Nommiste B.", "AuthorID": "56444492500", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7402236681": {"Name": "Carr A.J.F.", "AuthorID": "7402236681", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
