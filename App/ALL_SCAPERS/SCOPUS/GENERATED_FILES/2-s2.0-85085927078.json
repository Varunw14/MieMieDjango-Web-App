Here, we analyse the supply-chain effects of a set of idealized lockdown scenarios, using the latest global trade modelling framework. We find that supply-chain losses that are related to initial COVID-19 lockdowns are largely dependent on the number of countries imposing restrictions and that losses are more sensitive to the duration of a lockdown than its strictness. However, a longer containment that can eradicate the disease imposes a smaller loss than shorter ones. Earlier, stricter and shorter lockdowns can minimize overall losses. A \u2018go-slow\u2019 approach to lifting restrictions may reduce overall damages if it avoids the need for further lockdowns. Regardless of the strategy, the complexity of global supply chains will magnify losses beyond the direct effects of COVID-19. Thus, pandemic control is a public good that requires collective efforts and support to lower-capacity countries.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Communicable Disease Control", "Coronavirus Infections", "Health Policy", "Humans", "Industry", "Models, Econometric", "Pandemics", "Pneumonia, Viral"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085927078", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"15839411900": {"Name": "Guan D.", "AuthorID": "15839411900", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London"}, "57217048157": {"Name": "Huo J.", "AuthorID": "57217048157", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth System Sciences, Tsinghua University"}, "57217046449": {"Name": "Lei T.", "AuthorID": "57217046449", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth System Sciences, Tsinghua University"}, "57217042827": {"Name": "Cheng D.", "AuthorID": "57217042827", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth System Sciences, Tsinghua University"}, "57205434882": {"Name": "Xu B.", "AuthorID": "57205434882", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Center for Healthy Cities, Institute for China Sustainable Urbanization, Tsinghua University"}, "57211236643": {"Name": "Gong P.", "AuthorID": "57211236643", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Center for Healthy Cities, Institute for China Sustainable Urbanization, Tsinghua University"}, "56603101200": {"Name": "Coffman D.M.", "AuthorID": "56603101200", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London"}, "57192543668": {"Name": "Wang D.", "AuthorID": "57192543668", "AffiliationID": "60032744", "AffiliationName": "School of Urban and Regional Science, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics"}, "23392612400": {"Name": "Hallegatte S.", "AuthorID": "23392612400", "AffiliationID": "60112834", "AffiliationName": "The World Bank"}, "57207228835": {"Name": "Davis S.J.", "AuthorID": "57207228835", "AffiliationID": "60007278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth System Science, University of California, Irvine"}, "57217048098": {"Name": "Li S.", "AuthorID": "57217048098", "AffiliationID": "60108071", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Blue and Green Development, Weihai Institute of Interdisciplinary Research, Shandong University"}, "57217050391": {"Name": "Bai Y.", "AuthorID": "57217050391", "AffiliationID": "60108071", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Blue and Green Development, Weihai Institute of Interdisciplinary Research, Shandong University"}, "57217042689": {"Name": "Xue Q.", "AuthorID": "57217042689", "AffiliationID": "60108071", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Blue and Green Development, Weihai Institute of Interdisciplinary Research, Shandong University"}, "57203988041": {"Name": "Chen P.", "AuthorID": "57203988041", "AffiliationID": "60019499", "AffiliationName": "Institutes of Science and Development, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "35096210000": {"Name": "Liang X.", "AuthorID": "35096210000", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Business School, University of Edinburgh"}, "57217043070": {"Name": "Lu X.", "AuthorID": "57217043070", "AffiliationID": "124520203", "AffiliationName": "Spark Ventures"}, "35195168500": {"Name": "Wang S.", "AuthorID": "35195168500", "AffiliationID": "60003707, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "55802235200": {"Name": "Hubacek K.", "AuthorID": "55802235200", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "Integrated Research on Energy, Environment and Society (IREES), University of Groningen"}}}
