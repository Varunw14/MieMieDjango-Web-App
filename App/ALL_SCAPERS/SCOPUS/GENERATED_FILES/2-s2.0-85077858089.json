Material and Methods: We conducted a case-control study in which cases of pre-eclampsia and healthy pregnant controls were recruited at the time of delivery from eight Colombian cities between 2000 and 2012. Odds of pre-eclampsia among women with a positive family history of pre-eclampsia or cardiovascular disease were compared to women without affected relatives (logistic regression modeling and multinomial logistic regression model [Ajusted]). Results: A total of 3510 pre-eclampsia cases and 4512 controls with data on family history of pre-eclampsia were included in analyses. A subsample of 3086 cases and 3888 controls also provided information on family history of cardiovascular disease. Women whose mothers had pre-eclampsia had 3.38 (95% CI 2.89, 3.96) higher odds than those who did not, and having an affected sister increased pre-eclampsia odds by 2.43 (95% CI 2.02, 2.93). The effect of having both mother and sister affected with pre-eclampsia was stronger than the two independent risk factors (OR 4.17 [95% CI 2.60, 6.69]). Women with parental history of cardiovascular disease also had an increased risk of pre-eclampsia (OR 1.58 [95% CI 1.24, 2.01]). Conclusions: Family history of pre-eclampsia increased the risk of PE. The impact of family history of cardiovascular disease on pre-eclampsia was more conservative, but serves to support the hypothesis that pre-eclampsia may reflect the premature exposure of underlying cardiovascular dysfunction, precipitated by the stress test of pregnancy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cardiovascular disease", "family history", "Pre-eclampsia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Gene-Environment Interaction", "Heredity", "Humans", "Logistic Models", "Medical History Taking", "Pre-Eclampsia", "Pregnancy", "Risk Factors", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077858089", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"7003706613": {"Name": "Serrano N.C.", "AuthorID": "7003706613", "AffiliationID": "60091576", "AffiliationName": "Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Bucaramanga"}, "57196243567": {"Name": "Quintero-Lesmes D.C.", "AuthorID": "57196243567", "AffiliationID": "60077397", "AffiliationName": "Fundaci\u00f3n Cardiovascular de Colombia FCV"}, "6602743665": {"Name": "Dudbridge F.", "AuthorID": "6602743665", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of Leicester"}, "57217571452": {"Name": "Leon L.J.", "AuthorID": "57217571452", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Genetics & Genomic Medicine, University College London"}, "7005545809": {"Name": "Hingorani A.D.", "AuthorID": "7005545809", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Genetics & Genomic Medicine, University College London"}, "57202958326": {"Name": "Williams D.J.", "AuthorID": "57202958326", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London Hospital"}, "26643595900": {"Name": "Casas J.P.", "AuthorID": "26643595900", "AffiliationID": "60105918", "AffiliationName": "Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center (MAVERIC), VA Boston Healthcare System"}}}
