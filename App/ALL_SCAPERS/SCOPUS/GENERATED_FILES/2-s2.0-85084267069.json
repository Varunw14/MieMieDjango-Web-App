Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdPatient-based outcomes complement clinical data with patients\u2019 self-evaluation of their physical, psychological, and social well-being, and as such facilitate clinical decision-making, assessing the quality of care provided, and evaluating practices and policies. Some validated generic oral health-related quality of life measures used in recent research indicated a high performance. There is a proportional relationship between the quality of life and periodontitis, ie, the higher the level of periodontitis, the poorer the oral health-related quality of life. This relationship is heightened by the presence of symptoms such as bleeding, halitosis, and mobility. On the other hand, periodontal treatment has demonstrated the capability to improve quality of life substantially. Future research should focus on questionnaires that are able to explain the interlinked pathways between periodontal conditions, approaches to treatment approaches, and patients\u2019 well-being. The acquisition of new knowledge in the field is essential for the whole community, as we treat people not millimeters.", "AuthorKeywords": ["oral health", "patient-based outcomes", "quality of life"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dental Care", "Halitosis", "Humans", "Oral Health", "Periodontal Diseases", "Periodontitis", "Quality of Life"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084267069", "SubjectAreas": [["Periodontics", "DENT", "3506"]], "AuthorData": {"36879606000": {"Name": "Graziani F.", "AuthorID": "36879606000", "AffiliationID": "60082061", "AffiliationName": "Sub-Unit of Periodontology, Halitosis and Periodontal Medicine, University Hospital of Pisa"}, "57204336866": {"Name": "Tsakos G.", "AuthorID": "57204336866", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, UCL"}}}
