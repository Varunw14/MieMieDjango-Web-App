Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc on behalf of American Neurological Association.We demonstrate the first use of Optically Pumped Magnetoencephalography (OP-MEG) in an epilepsy patient with unrestricted head movement. Current clinical MEG uses a traditional SQUID system, where sensors are cryogenically cooled and housed in a helmet in which the patient\u2019s head is fixed. Here, we use a different type of sensor (OPM), which operates at room temperature and can be placed directly on the patient\u2019s scalp, permitting free head movement. We performed OP-MEG recording in a patient with refractory focal epilepsy. OP-MEG-identified analogous interictal activity to scalp EEG, and source localized this activity to an appropriate brain region.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081027207", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"34973665100": {"Name": "Vivekananda U.", "AuthorID": "34973665100", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL, Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "57205684644": {"Name": "Mellor S.", "AuthorID": "57205684644", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL"}, "56921739000": {"Name": "Tierney T.M.", "AuthorID": "56921739000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL"}, "23995713600": {"Name": "Litvak V.", "AuthorID": "23995713600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL"}, "7202142345": {"Name": "Barnes G.R.", "AuthorID": "7202142345", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL"}, "35243898700": {"Name": "Walker M.C.", "AuthorID": "35243898700", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL, Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "57201420913": {"Name": "Holmes N.", "AuthorID": "57201420913", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham"}, "57191490424": {"Name": "Boto E.", "AuthorID": "57191490424", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham"}, "57197534488": {"Name": "Leggett J.", "AuthorID": "57197534488", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham"}, "57201428018": {"Name": "Roberts G.", "AuthorID": "57201428018", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham"}, "57201632590": {"Name": "Hill R.M.", "AuthorID": "57201632590", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham"}, "8599486300": {"Name": "Brookes M.J.", "AuthorID": "8599486300", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham"}, "7005010989": {"Name": "Bowtell R.", "AuthorID": "7005010989", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham"}}}
