However, cyst recurrence and the need for re-operation are well recognized. To this end, the aim of this study was to investigate patterns of recurrence and long-term outcomes and to use this information to develop an optimal follow-up strategy. Method: A prospectively maintained database was searched over a 10-year period between 1 January 2008 and the 1 January 2018 to identify all adults that underwent transsphenoidal surgery with a new diagnosis of Rathke\u2019s cleft cyst. A retrospective case note review was performed for each patient to extract data on their presentation, investigation, treatment, and outcome. Results: In all, 61 eligible patients were identified. The median follow-up was 34 months (range 2\u2013112 months). In the 22 patients with pre-operative visual loss, the outcomes at 6 months were as follows: normal vision (2/22; 9.1%), improved but not normal (7/22; 31.8%), stable (12/22; 54.5%), worse but not blind (1/22; 4.5%), and blind (0/22; 0%). The overall rate of regrowth and re-operation in our study was 19.7 and 11.5%, respectively. The only factor that was significantly associated with recurrence was the presence of residual cystic disease on the post-operative MRI (p < 0.001). Conclusions: We propose a follow-up strategy that stratifies patients at \u201clow risk\u201d if there is no residual cyst, with increasing interval scans, or \u201chigh risk\u201d if there is residual cyst, with annual visual assessment and scans.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Outcomes", "Pituitary", "Rathke\u2019s cleft cyst", "Surgery"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Brain Neoplasms", "Central Nervous System Cysts", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Recurrence, Local", "Neoplasm, Residual", "Neurosurgical Procedures", "Postoperative Period", "Reoperation", "Retrospective Studies", "Treatment Outcome", "Vision Disorders", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078160394", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"16643089500": {"Name": "Marcus H.J.", "AuthorID": "16643089500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome EPSRC centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences, University College London"}, "36571464100": {"Name": "Borg A.", "AuthorID": "36571464100", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57214073546": {"Name": "Hussein Z.", "AuthorID": "57214073546", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Endocrinology, University College London Hospital"}, "6603340565": {"Name": "Baldeweg S.E.", "AuthorID": "6603340565", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Endocrinology, University College London Hospital"}, "7003433410": {"Name": "Grieve J.", "AuthorID": "7003433410", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "6701868395": {"Name": "Dorward N.L.", "AuthorID": "6701868395", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome EPSRC centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences, University College London"}, "54083212800": {"Name": "Jaunmuktane Z.", "AuthorID": "54083212800", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropathology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
