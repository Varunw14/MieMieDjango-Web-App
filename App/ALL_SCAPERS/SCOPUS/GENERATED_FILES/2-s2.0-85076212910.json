Study of the hearts of ungulates was a central part in his investigation, which assessed other species, including man. He described several subtle differences between the mammals. We have now ourselves studied the cardiac conduction tissue of the ox heart, comparing our findings with our knowledge of the arrangement in man, and providing new insights into the differences illustrated by Tawara. It is, perhaps, surprising that these differences, although subtle, have not attracted more attention. We show that the major difference is the fact that the noncoronary aortic sinus in the ox heart is mainly supported by the myocardium of the ventricular septum, whereas in the human heart the sinus, and its leaflet, are in fibrous contiguity with the aortic leaflet of the mitral valve. It is this feature that determines the difference in the arrangement of the conduction axis between the species. We also show that the emergence of the left bundle branch on the left ventricular aspect of the muscular septum is more variable than previously described. Clin.
