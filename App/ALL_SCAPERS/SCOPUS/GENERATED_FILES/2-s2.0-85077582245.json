Here, we combine mitochondrial and transcriptome sequences with morphological analysis to describe three species of bobtail squid (Sepiolidae: Sepiolinae) from the Ryukyu archipelago, and compare them with related taxa. One Ryukyuan type was previously unknown, and is described here as Euprymna brenneri sp. nov. Another Ryukyuan type is morphologically indistinguishable from Sepiola parva Sasaki, 1913. Molecular analyses, however, place this taxon within the genus Euprymna Steenstrup, 1887, and additional morphological investigation led to formal rediagnosis of Euprymna and reassignment of this species as Euprymna parva comb. nov. While no adults from the third Ryukyuan type were found, sequences from hatchlings suggest a close relationship with E. pardalota Reid, 2011, known from Australia and East Timor. The broadly sampled transcriptomes reported here provide a foundation for future phylogenetic and comparative studies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Decapodiformes", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Islands", "Molecular Typing", "Phenotype", "Phylogeny"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077582245", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"]], "AuthorData": {"56763498800": {"Name": "Sanchez G.", "AuthorID": "56763498800", "AffiliationID": "60030788", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Integrated Sciences for Life, Hiroshima University, Higashi Hiroshima"}, "57213160231": {"Name": "Jolly J.", "AuthorID": "57213160231", "AffiliationID": "60103932", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Genetics Unit, Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University"}, "57213147013": {"Name": "Sugimoto C.", "AuthorID": "57213147013", "AffiliationID": "60103932", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Genetics Unit, Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University"}, "57213164583": {"Name": "Azama C.", "AuthorID": "57213164583", "AffiliationID": "60103932", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Genetics Unit, Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University"}, "24468627600": {"Name": "Marl\u00e9taz F.", "AuthorID": "24468627600", "AffiliationID": "60103932", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Genetics Unit, Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University"}, "12783132000": {"Name": "Simakov O.", "AuthorID": "12783132000", "AffiliationID": "60025988", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Evolution and Development, University of Vienna"}, "7004149813": {"Name": "Rokhsar D.S.", "AuthorID": "7004149813", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, Life Sciences Addition #3200"}, "7202690822": {"Name": "Reid A.", "AuthorID": "7202690822", "AffiliationID": "60017681", "AffiliationName": "Australian Museum Research Institute"}}}
