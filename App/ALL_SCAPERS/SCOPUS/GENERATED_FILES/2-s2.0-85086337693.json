In particular, this paper presents a dense family A of simply-connected two-dimensional domains with analytic boundaries such that, for each \u03a9 \u2208 A, the nodal set of the eigenfunction \u03d5\u03c3j \u201cis not dense at scale \u03c3j-1\u201d. This result addresses a question put forth under \u201cOpen Problem 10\u201d in Girouard and Polterovich (J Spectr Theory 7(2):321\u2013359, 2017). In fact, the results in the present paper establish that, for domains \u03a9 \u2208 A, the nodal sets of the eigenfunctions \u03d5\u03c3j associated with the eigenvalue \u03c3j have starkly different character than anticipated: they are not dense at any shrinking scale. More precisely, for each \u03a9 \u2208 A there is a value r1> 0 such that for each j there is xj\u2208 \u03a9 such that \u03d5\u03c3j does not vanish on the ball of radius r1 around xj.", "AuthorKeywords": ["High frequency", "Nodal set", "Steklov"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086337693", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"], ["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"7005034354": {"Name": "Bruno O.P.", "AuthorID": "7005034354", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences, Caltech"}, "16401508800": {"Name": "Galkowski J.", "AuthorID": "16401508800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
