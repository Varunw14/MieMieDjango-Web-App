For appropriate orbital parameters, some of these systems may also emit gravitational radiation in a \u2018burst-like\u2019 pattern. The observation of this burst radiation in conjunction with the electromagnetic radio timing signal would allow for multimessenger astronomy in strong-field gravitational regimes. In this work we investigate gravitational radiation from these PSR-EMRBs, calculating the waveforms and SNRs and explore the influence of this GW on the pulsar radio signal. We find that for typical PSR-EMRBs, gravitational burst radiation should be detectable from both the Galactic centre and the centre of stellar clusters, and that this radiation will not meaningfully affect the pulsar timing signal, allowing PSR-EMRB to remain \u2018clean\u2019 test-beds of strong-field GR.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Black hole physics", "Gravitation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096958229", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57204206628": {"Name": "Kimpson T.", "AuthorID": "57204206628", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "57201393478": {"Name": "Wu K.", "AuthorID": "57201393478", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "7003322389": {"Name": "Zane S.", "AuthorID": "7003322389", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}}}
