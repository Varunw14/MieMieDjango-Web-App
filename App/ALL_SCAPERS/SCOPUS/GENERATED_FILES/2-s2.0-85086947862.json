Focusing on self-confidence, this article draws on survey responses from 9,059 12-13 year olds who were tracked by subject (\u2018setting\u2019). They provided survey responses when placed in \u2018ability\u2019 sets at the start of their secondary schooling, and again late the following year; enabling analysis of impact over time. After controlling for prior attainment, the gap in general self-confidence between students in the top and bottom sets for mathematics is shown to widen over time, and high set students\u2019 self-confidence in English had also grown significantly; although there was not further widening in the cases of self-confidence in mathematics or in general self-confidence between students in the top and bottom sets for English. Implications of these findings for interventions directed at addressing educational disadvantage are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["attainment grouping", "self-confidence", "setting", "social inequality", "social justice", "Tracking"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086947862", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"7102276052": {"Name": "Francis B.", "AuthorID": "7102276052", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, UCL Institute of Education (IOE)"}, "18036999700": {"Name": "Hodgen J.", "AuthorID": "18036999700", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, UCL Institute of Education (IOE)"}, "57033429900": {"Name": "Taylor B.", "AuthorID": "57033429900", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, UCL Institute of Education (IOE)"}, "36459067800": {"Name": "Tereshchenko A.", "AuthorID": "36459067800", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, UCL Institute of Education (IOE)"}, "7103359770": {"Name": "Archer L.", "AuthorID": "7103359770", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, UCL Institute of Education (IOE)"}, "57204122049": {"Name": "Craig N.", "AuthorID": "57204122049", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "School of Education, Queen\u2019s University Belfast"}, "7102421310": {"Name": "Connolly P.", "AuthorID": "7102421310", "AffiliationID": "60117608, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, Lancaster University"}}}
