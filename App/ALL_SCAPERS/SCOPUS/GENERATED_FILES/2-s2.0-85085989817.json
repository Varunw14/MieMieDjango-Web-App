EIXPCT resolution is mainly determined by the period of a sample mask, but can be significantly improved by a dithering technique. Here, dithering means that multiple images per tomographic view angle are acquired as the object is moved over sub-pixel distances. Drawbacks of dithering include increased data-acquisition times and radiation doses. Motivated by the flexibility in data-acquisition designs enabled by a recently developed joint reconstruction method, a novel partial-dithering strategy for EIXPCT data-acquisition is proposed. In this strategy, dithering is implemented at only a subset of the tomographic view angles. The strategy can result in spatial resolution comparable to that of the conventional full-dithering strategy, where dithering is performed at every view angle, but the acquisition time is substantially decreased. Here, the effect of dithering parameters on image resolution is explored.", "AuthorKeywords": ["data-acquisition", "joint reconstruction", "phase-contrast tomography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acquisition time", "Complex-valued", "Dithering technique", "Imaging technology", "Multiple image", "Reconstruction method", "Spatial resolution", "X-ray phase-contrast tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085989817", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57190290022": {"Name": "Chen Y.", "AuthorID": "57190290022", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Washington University in St Louis"}, "55508570900": {"Name": "Hagen C.K.", "AuthorID": "55508570900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004072469": {"Name": "Olivo A.", "AuthorID": "7004072469", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006769220": {"Name": "Anastasio M.A.", "AuthorID": "7006769220", "AffiliationID": "60000745", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"}}}
