Contact sensors often used in these fields require contact with the target surface throughout the duration of a strain event. Non-contact methods typically require that that the measurement surface is prepared and often coated prior to testing. This paper considers the potential application of near infrared spectroscopy as a non-contact technique for the measurement of strain on natural surfaces. Excellent correlation was found between surface measurements of visible-NIR spectra and longitudinal strain taken during indirect Brazilian Disc Test for samples of sandstone, marble and basalt.", "AuthorKeywords": ["indirect tensile strength", "near infrared spectroscopy", "rock", "Strain measurement"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brazilian disc tests", "Indirect tensile strength", "Longitudinal strain", "Natural surface", "Near Infrared", "Non-contact techniques", "Noncontact methods", "Target surface"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071908272", "SubjectAreas": [["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"]], "AuthorData": {"57210929302": {"Name": "Butcher E.", "AuthorID": "57210929302", "AffiliationID": "60025475", "AffiliationName": "Rock Mechanics Laboratory, School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Portsmouth"}, "57210933661": {"Name": "Gibson A.", "AuthorID": "57210933661", "AffiliationID": "60025475", "AffiliationName": "Rock Mechanics Laboratory, School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Portsmouth"}, "8980992700": {"Name": "Benson P.M.", "AuthorID": "8980992700", "AffiliationID": "60025475", "AffiliationName": "Rock Mechanics Laboratory, School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Portsmouth"}, "56550018500": {"Name": "Koor N.", "AuthorID": "56550018500", "AffiliationID": "60025475", "AffiliationName": "Rock Mechanics Laboratory, School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Portsmouth"}, "7103395487": {"Name": "Swift G.", "AuthorID": "7103395487", "AffiliationID": "60025475", "AffiliationName": "Rock Mechanics Laboratory, School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Portsmouth"}}}
