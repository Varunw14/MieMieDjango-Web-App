Definiteness projection says that the uniqueness inference of a definite projects out unless there is an indefinite antecedent in a position that filters presuppositions. We argue that definiteness projection poses a serious puzzle for e-type theories of (in)definites; on such theories, indefinites should filter existence presuppositions but not uniqueness presuppositions. We argue that definiteness projection also poses challenges for dynamic approaches, which have trouble generating uniqueness inferences and predicting some filtering behavior, though unlike the challenge for e-type theories, these challenges have mostly been noted in the literature, albeit in a piecemeal way. Our central aim, however, is not to argue for or against a particular view, but rather to formulate and motivate a generalization about definiteness which any adequate theory must account for.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077167753", "SubjectAreas": [["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"57195399515": {"Name": "Mandelkern M.", "AuthorID": "57195399515", "AffiliationID": "60099141", "AffiliationName": "All Souls College"}, "26429930800": {"Name": "Rothschild D.", "AuthorID": "26429930800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
