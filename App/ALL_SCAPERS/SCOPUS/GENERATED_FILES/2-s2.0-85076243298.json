Injury to this complex system creates a deficit in function, which is slow to recover, and rarely, if ever, returns to what patients consider to be normal. Despite promising results in pre-clinical animal experimentation effective translation is challenged by a current inability to quantify nerve regeneration in human subjects and relate this to measurable and responsible clinical outcomes. In animal models, muscle and nerve tissue samples can be harvested following experimental intervention. This allows direct quantification of muscle mass and quality and quantity of regeneration of axons; such an approach is not applicable in human medicine as it would ensure a significant functional deficit. Nevertheless a greater understanding of this process would allow the relationship that exists between neural and neuromuscular regeneration and functional outcome to be more clearly understood. This article presents a combined commentary of current practice from a specialist clinical unit and research team with regard to laboratory and clinical quantification of nerve regeneration. We highlight how electrophysiological diagnostic methods (which are used with significant recognised limitations in the assessment of clinical medicine) can potentially be used with more validity to interpret and assess the processes of neural regeneration in the clinical context, thus throwing light on the factors at play in translating lab advances into the clinic.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Axon regeneration", "Clinical assessment", "Functional recovery", "MUNE", "Patient-reported outcome measures", "Peripheral nerve injury"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Electrodiagnosis", "Electrophysiological Phenomena", "Humans", "Nerve Regeneration", "Peripheral Nerve Injuries", "Peripheral Nerves"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076243298", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"]], "AuthorData": {"57204317976": {"Name": "Rayner M.L.D.", "AuthorID": "57204317976", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nerve Engineering"}, "57209684509": {"Name": "Wilcox M.", "AuthorID": "57209684509", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Peripheral Nerve Injury Unit Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "9240949100": {"Name": "Phillips J.B.", "AuthorID": "9240949100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nerve Engineering"}, "57204669328": {"Name": "Brown H.L.", "AuthorID": "57204669328", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Peripheral Nerve Injury Unit Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "56636855000": {"Name": "Quick T.J.", "AuthorID": "56636855000", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Peripheral Nerve Injury Unit Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}}}
