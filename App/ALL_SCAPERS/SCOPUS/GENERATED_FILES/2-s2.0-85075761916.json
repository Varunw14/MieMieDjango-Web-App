Methods: We combine data from eight Health and Demographic Surveillance Sites across sub-Saharan Africa, from an adolescent-specific survey that included 7116 males and females age 10\u201319 years old. We provide pooled and site-specific estimates from multiple analytic models examining the how year-specific age, school attendance and work correlate with knowledge of menstruation, HIV knowledge and knowledge of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) other than HIV. Results: Many adolescents lack knowledge of menstruation (37.3%, 95% CI 31.8, 43.1 do not know of menstruation) and STIs other than HIV (55.9%, 95% CI 50.4, 61.3 do not know of other STIs). In multivariate analysis, older age, being in school and wealth are significant positive correlates of STI knowledge. Older adolescent age, female sex and being in school are significant positive correlates of knowledge of menstruation. Knowledge of HIV is high (89.7%, 95% CI 8.3, 12.7 know of HIV) and relatively similar across adolescent age, sex, wealth and school and work attendance. Conclusion: Knowledge of HIV is widespread across adolescents in these communities in sub-Saharan Africa, but knowledge of other dimensions of sexual and reproductive health \u2013 menstruation and other STIs in this study \u2013 is lacking especially for early adolescents (10- to 14-year olds). The dissemination of more comprehensive sexual and reproductive health information is needed within these and similar communities in SSA to help adolescents gain insight on how to make their own decisions towards positive adolescent sexual and reproductive health and protect them from risks.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adolescent", "knowledge", "sexual and reproductive health", "sub-Saharan Africa"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adolescent Health", "Africa South of the Sahara", "Age Factors", "Child", "Female", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "Male", "Menstruation", "Reproductive Health", "Sexual Health", "Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075761916", "SubjectAreas": [["Parasitology", "IMMU", "2405"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"23008230900": {"Name": "Finlay J.E.", "AuthorID": "23008230900", "AffiliationID": "60032499", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard T.H.
