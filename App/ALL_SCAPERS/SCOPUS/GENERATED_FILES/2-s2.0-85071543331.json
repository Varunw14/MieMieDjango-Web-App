All rights reserved.Decarbonization has driven the uptake of variable renewable energy resources, both utility scale and distributed. This is driving the development of new business models of how electricity is distributed and managed on the network. One such model, peer-to-peer trading, allows consumers, prosumers, and prosumagers to trade energy between themselves, both lowering costs while providing balancing services to the network. Enabling technologies such as blockchains can help build trust and track transactions efficiently, securely and at low cost. This chapter examines the factors governing successful deployment of such systems and technical and regulatory challenges.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blockchain technology", "Business models", "Community self-consumption", "Decentral energy generation", "Peer-to-peer trading", "Platforms", "Regional energy markets", "Transactive energy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071543331", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)", "ECON", "2000"], ["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"]], "AuthorData": {"6507200086": {"Name": "Shipworth D.", "AuthorID": "6507200086", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL"}, "56872474300": {"Name": "Burger C.", "AuthorID": "56872474300", "AffiliationID": "101269519", "AffiliationName": "ESMT"}, "14632669900": {"Name": "Weinmann J.", "AuthorID": "14632669900", "AffiliationID": "101269519", "AffiliationName": "ESMT"}, "55942385300": {"Name": "Sioshansi F.", "AuthorID": "55942385300", "AffiliationID": "60176013", "AffiliationName": "Menlo Energy Economics"}}}
