After his PhD, he led technical developments in an internal venture at Philips Research (Eindhoven, Netherlands) to develop devices with integrated optical sensors and brought this technology from benchtop prototypes to in vivo human studies. In addition to his responsibilities at Echopoint Medical (London, UK) where he is Chief Technology Officer, Adrien is also is a Professor of Biomedical Engineering at University College London (London, UK), where he leads the interventional devices group with a vision to develop novel methods for performing physiological measurements and imaging with minimally invasive devices. He has over 52 patent applications and granted patents.", "AuthorKeywords": ["coronary physiology", "FFR", "fibre optic sensing", "flow", "microvascular dysfunction"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081080031", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57204519454": {"Name": "Desjardins A.", "AuthorID": "57204519454", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
