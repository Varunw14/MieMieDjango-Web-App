However, the effect of its internal differences on the distribution of educational resources needs to be examined systematically. Drawing upon in-depth interviews with parents in 53 middle-class families in Dehradun, India, this paper explores three aspects of the home-school relationship: how socioeconomic transformations shape parents\u2019 aspirations for their children\u2019s future, educational decisions parents make to realise those aspirations, and mothers\u2019 engagement in their children\u2019s everyday schooling. The tripartite analysis reveals that despite sharing common educational goals and strategies with the population in general, middle-class families in India use their class privilege to gain valuable educational resources. The paper argues that the discrepancy in the mobilisation of accumulated resources in the heterogeneous middle-class results in disparate educational advantages across families. It critiques the binary construction of social classes when explaining the processes of social reproduction in contemporary Indian society.", "AuthorKeywords": ["capital", "educational advantage", "Heterogeneous middle-class", "parental aspirations", "parental engagement", "school-choice"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072053422", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"57210955189": {"Name": "Gupta A.", "AuthorID": "57210955189", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
