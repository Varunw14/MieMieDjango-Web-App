Methods: Probability plots were derived from the measurements of NT MoM values used in a 2018 audit of 22,362 unaffected pregnancies. The plots were used to determine whether the NT MoM upper truncation limit should be lowered. Validation plots were used to assess the screening accuracy of Down\u2019s syndrome risk estimates calculated from observed NT MoM values in the 22,362 unaffected pregnancies and 69 Down\u2019s syndrome pregnancies for original and revised NT MoM truncation limits. Results: Probability plots indicated that with improved precision of NT measurements, there was deviation from a Gaussian distribution at less high MoM values than with less precise measurements. Validation plots showed that using the current NT MoM upper truncation limit of 2.5 MoM with improved precision NT measurements overestimates the Down\u2019s syndrome risk (median risk in highest risk category expressed as an odds was 53.3:1 and observed prevalence was 1:1.1). The large discrepancy was corrected by changing the NT upper truncation limit to 2.0 MoM (median risk in highest risk category expressed as an odds was 1:1.78 and observed prevalence 1:2.7). Conclusion: The NT MoM upper truncation limit should be reduced from 2.5 to 2.0 MoM.", "AuthorKeywords": ["antenatal screening", "Down\u2019s syndrome", "nuchal translucency", "prenatal screening", "truncation limit", "validation plot"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087397491", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57217582589": {"Name": "Vale S.H.", "AuthorID": "57217582589", "AffiliationID": "100774897", "AffiliationName": "Logical Medical Systems Ltd"}, "57203046820": {"Name": "Wald N.J.", "AuthorID": "57203046820", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Health Informatics"}, "26648455200": {"Name": "Huttly W.J.", "AuthorID": "26648455200", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
