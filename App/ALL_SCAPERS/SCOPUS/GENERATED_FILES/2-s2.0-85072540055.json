There is evidence that the process of creating an EPC introduces measurement error such that repeat assessments of the same property give different ratings, compromising their reliability. This study presents a novel error analysis to estimate the size of this effect, using repeated EPC assessments of 1.6 million existing dwellings in England and Wales. A statistical model of how measurement error contributes to variation between repeated measurements is set out, and exploratory data analysis is used to decide how to apply this model to the available data. The results predict that the one standard deviation measurement error decreases with EPC rating, from around \u00b1 8.0 EPC points on a rating of 35 to \u00b12.4 on a rating of 85. This predicted error is higher than the limit recommended in UK guidance except in very efficient buildings; it can also result in dwellings being rated in the wrong EPC band, for example it was estimated that 24% of band D homes are rated as band C.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dataset", "Domestic buildings", "Energy performance certificates", "Mathematical modelling", "Uncertainty"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dataset", "Domestic buildings", "Energy performance", "Exploratory data analysis", "Investment decisions", "Repeated measurements", "Statistical modeling", "Uncertainty"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072540055", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Energy (miscellaneous)", "ENER", "2101"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57208023742": {"Name": "Crawley J.", "AuthorID": "57208023742", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute, University College London"}, "57197676050": {"Name": "Biddulph P.", "AuthorID": "57197676050", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute, University College London"}, "16311307300": {"Name": "Wingfield J.", "AuthorID": "16311307300", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute, University College London"}, "6602850020": {"Name": "Oreszczyn T.", "AuthorID": "6602850020", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute, University College London"}, "55756255300": {"Name": "Elwell C.", "AuthorID": "55756255300", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute, University College London"}, "6601969941": {"Name": "Northrop P.J.", "AuthorID": "6601969941", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}}}
