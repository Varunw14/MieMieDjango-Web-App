Increased or decreased intracellular C3 results in autoimmunity and infections, respectively. The mechanisms regulating intracellular C3 expression remain undefined. We identified complement, including C3, as among the most significantly enriched biological pathway in tissue-occupying cells. We generated C3-reporter mice and confirmed that C3 expression was a defining feature of tissue-immune cells, including T cells and monocytes, occurred during transendothelial diapedesis, and depended on integrin lymphocyte-function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) signals. Immune cells from patients with leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 (LAD-1) had reduced C3 transcripts and diminished effector activities, which could be rescued proportionally by intracellular C3 provision. Conversely, increased C3 expression by T cells from arthritis patients correlated with disease severity. Our study defines integrins as key controllers of intracellular complement, demonstrates that perturbations in the LFA-1-C3-axis contribute to primary immunodeficiency, and identifies intracellular C3 as biomarker of severity in autoimmunity.\u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.Intracellular complement C3 regulates human immune cell responses, but how C3 levels are controlled remains undefined. Kolev et al. demonstrate that C3 gene expression is a cardinal feature of immune cells in tissues. C3 transcription depends on integrin LFA-1 signals and diminished \u201cC3 licensing\u201d in LFA-1-deficient patients contributes to their compromised immunity, revealing integrins as key controllers
