The proteins interleukin 10 (IL-10) and heart fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP) have shown predictive values for the presence of intracranial lesions. Aim: To evaluate the individual and combined outcome prediction ability of IL-10 and H-FABP, and to compare them to the more studied proteins S100\u03b2, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light (NF-L), both with and without clinical predictors. Methods: Blood samples from patients with acute TBI (all severities) were collected <24 h post trauma. The outcome was measured >6 months post injury using the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) score, dichotomizing patients into: (i) those with favorable (GOSE\u22655)/unfavorable outcome (GOSE \u2264 4) and complete (GOSE = 8)/incomplete (GOSE \u2264 7) recovery, and (ii) patients with mild TBI (mTBI) and patients with TBIs of all severities. Results: When sensitivity was set at 95\u2013100%, the proteins' individual specificities remained low. H-FABP showed the best specificity (%) and sensitivity (100%) in predicting complete recovery in patients with mTBI. IL-10 had the best specificity (50%) and sensitivity (96%) in identifying patients with favorable outcome in patients with TBIs of all severities. When individual proteins were combined with clinical parameters, a model including H-FABP, NF-L, and ISS yielded a specificity of 56% and a sensitivity of 96% in predicting complete recovery in patients with mTBI. In predicting favorable outcome, a model consisting IL-10, age, and TBI severity reached a specificity of 80% and a sensitivity of 96% in patients with TBIs of all severities. Conclusion: Combining novel TBI biomarkers H-FABP and IL-10 with GFAP, NF-L and S100\u03b2 and clinical parameters improves outcome prediction models in TBI.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biomarker", "heart fatty-acid binding protein", "interleukin 10", "outcome", "panel", "protein", "traumatic brain injury"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086520769", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56941840200": {"Name": "Lagerstedt L.", "AuthorID": "56941840200", "AffiliationID": "60004718, 60026405", "AffiliationName": "Department of Specialities of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva"}, "55316960100": {"Name": "Azurmendi L.", "AuthorID": "55316960100", "AffiliationID": "60004718, 60026405", "AffiliationName": "Department of Specialities of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva"}, "7403998035": {"Name": "Sanchez J.C.", "AuthorID": "7403998035", "AffiliationID": "60004718, 60026405", "AffiliationName": "Department of Specialities of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva"}, "6602760486": {"Name": "Tenovuo O.", "AuthorID": "6602760486", "AffiliationID": "60006876", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Turku"}, "57160391300": {"Name": "Maanp\u00e4\u00e4 H.R.", "AuthorID": "57160391300", "AffiliationID": "60025765", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Neurosciences, Department of Neurosurgery, Turku University Hospital Turku"}, "57193861511": {"Name": "Hossain I.", "AuthorID": "57193861511", "AffiliationID": "60025765", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Neurosciences, Department of Neurosurgery, Turku University Hospital Turku"}, "14011678000": {"Name": "Posti J.P.", "AuthorID": "14011678000", "AffiliationID": "60025765", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Neurosciences, Department of Neurosurgery, Turku University Hospital Turku"}, "23013409300": {"Name": "Tallus J.", "AuthorID": "23013409300", "AffiliationID": "60006876", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Turku"}, "6602739631": {"Name": "Katila A.J.", "AuthorID": "6602739631", "AffiliationID": "60025765, 60006876", "AffiliationName": "Perioperative Services, Intensive Care Medicine and Pain Management, Turku University Hospital and University of Turku"}, "6505990872": {"Name": "Takala R.S.K.", "AuthorID": "6505990872", "AffiliationID": "60025765, 60006876", "AffiliationName": "Perioperative Services, Intensive Care Medicine and Pain Management, Turku University Hospital and University of Turku"}, "7101909602": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "7101909602", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg"}, "57208899083": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "57208899083", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "18434494300": {"Name": "Newcombe V.F.J.", "AuthorID": "18434494300", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60017488", "AffiliationName": "Division of Anaesthesia, Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "7101687199": {"Name": "Menon D.K.", "AuthorID": "7101687199", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60017488", "AffiliationName": "Division of Anaesthesia, Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "6508082245": {"Name": "Gils M.v.", "AuthorID": "6508082245", "AffiliationID": "60033191", "AffiliationName": "Knowledge Intensive Products and Services, VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd"}, "25643268600": {"Name": "Hutchinson P.J.", "AuthorID": "25643268600", "AffiliationID": "60008659", "AffiliationName": "Royal College of Surgeons of England"}}}
