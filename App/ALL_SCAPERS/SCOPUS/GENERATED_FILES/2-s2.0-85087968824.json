Synapse published by Wiley Periodicals LLCAction potentials trigger two modes of neurotransmitter release, with a fast synchronous component and a temporally delayed asynchronous release. Asynchronous release contributes to information transfer at synapses, including at the hippocampal mossy fiber (MF) to CA3 pyramidal cell synapse where it controls the timing of postsynaptic CA3 pyramidal neuron firing. Here, we identified and characterized the main determinants of asynchronous release at the MF\u2013CA3 synapse. We found that asynchronous release at MF\u2013CA3 synapses can last on the order of seconds following repetitive MF stimulation. Elevating the stimulation frequency or the external Ca2+ concentration increased the rate of asynchronous release, thus, arguing that presynaptic Ca2+ dynamics is the major determinant of asynchronous release rate. Direct MF bouton Ca2+ imaging revealed slow Ca2+ decay kinetics of action potential (AP) burst-evoked Ca2+ transients. Finally, we observed that asynchronous release was preferentially mediated by Ca2+ influx through P/Q-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, while the contribution of N-type VGCCs was limited. Overall, our results uncover the determinants of long-lasting asynchronous release from MF terminals and suggest that asynchronous release could influence CA3 pyramidal cell firing up to seconds following termination of granule cell bursting.", "AuthorKeywords": ["asynchronous release", "calcium", "hippocampus", "mossy fibers", "presynaptic"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087968824", "SubjectAreas": [["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"26535482400": {"Name": "Chamberland S.", "AuthorID": "26535482400", "AffiliationID": "60032619", "AffiliationName": "CERVO Brain Research Center, Department of Psychiatry and Neuroscience, Universit\u00e9 Laval"}, "16241631100": {"Name": "Evstratova A.", "AuthorID": "16241631100", "AffiliationID": "60032619", "AffiliationName": "CERVO Brain Research Center, Department of Psychiatry and Neuroscience, Universit\u00e9 Laval"}, "6602184020": {"Name": "Timofeeva Y.", "AuthorID": "6602184020", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "6603211980": {"Name": "Volynski K.", "AuthorID": "6603211980", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57218113835": {"Name": "Norman C.A.", "AuthorID": "57218113835", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Mathematics for Real-World Systems Centre for Doctoral Training, University of Warwick"}, "56410468800": {"Name": "T\u00f3th K.", "AuthorID": "56410468800", "AffiliationID": "60028897", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa"}}}
