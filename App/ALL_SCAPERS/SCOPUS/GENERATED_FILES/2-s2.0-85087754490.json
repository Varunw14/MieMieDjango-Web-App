KEN with underlying RAS mutations have been associated with hypophosphatemic rickets and dysplastic bone lesions described as congenital cutaneous skeletal hypophosphatemia syndrome. Here, we describe two patients with keratinocytic epidermal nevi, in one associated with a papular nevus spilus, who presented with distinct localized congenital fibro-osseous lesions in the lower leg, diagnosed on both radiology and histology as osteofibrous dysplasia, in the absence of hypophosphatemia or rickets, or significantly raised FGF23 levels but with distinct mosaic HRAS mutations. This expands the spectrum of cutaneous/skeletal mosaic RASopathies and alerts clinicians to the importance of evaluating for bony disease even in the absence of bone profile abnormalities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["epidermal nevus", "HRAS", "hypophosphatemia", "mosaic", "nevus spilus", "osteofibrous dysplasia", "phakomatosis pigmentokeratotica", "RASopathy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087754490", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"]], "AuthorData": {"56819125400": {"Name": "Mestach L.", "AuthorID": "56819125400", "AffiliationID": "60031069", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology, University Hospitals of Leuven"}, "6507272035": {"Name": "Van Laethem A.", "AuthorID": "6507272035", "AffiliationID": "60031069", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology, University Hospitals of Leuven"}, "6701455747": {"Name": "Morren M.A.", "AuthorID": "6701455747", "AffiliationID": "60031069", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology, University Hospitals of Leuven"}, "26635668500": {"Name": "Polubothu S.", "AuthorID": "26635668500", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Dermatology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6506836269": {"Name": "Kinsler V.A.", "AuthorID": "6506836269", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Dermatology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36105996700": {"Name": "Gholam K.", "AuthorID": "36105996700", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Dermatology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "23481036600": {"Name": "Calder A.", "AuthorID": "23481036600", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Radiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "22034319300": {"Name": "Denayer E.", "AuthorID": "22034319300", "AffiliationID": "60031069", "AffiliationName": "Center for Human Genetics, University Hospital Leuven"}, "57205906465": {"Name": "Legius E.", "AuthorID": "57205906465", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Genetics, KU Leuven - University of Leuven"}, "6602150980": {"Name": "Brems H.", "AuthorID": "6602150980", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Genetics, KU Leuven - University of Leuven"}, "6701308902": {"Name": "Levtchenko E.", "AuthorID": "6701308902", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Development and Regeneration, KU Leuven"}}}
