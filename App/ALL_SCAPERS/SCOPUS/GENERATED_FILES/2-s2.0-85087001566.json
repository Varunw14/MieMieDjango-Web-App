In this article, we compare our new image registration-based distortion correction method \u2018COPE\u2019 to an implementation of the pixelshift method. Our approach builds on existing image registration-based techniques using opposite phase encoding, extending these by local cost aggregation. Comparison of these methods with 3T and 7T spin-echo (SE) and gradient-echo (GE) data show that the image registration-based method is a good alternative to the fieldmap-based EPI distortion correction method.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Image registration", "Susceptibility distortion correction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cost aggregations", "Displacement maps", "Distortion correction", "Functional MRI", "Geometrical distortion", "Gradient echo", "Phase encoding", "Spin echo"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087001566", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57217295525": {"Name": "Breman H.", "AuthorID": "57217295525", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience, Maastricht University"}, "55625219000": {"Name": "Mulders J.", "AuthorID": "55625219000", "AffiliationID": "60114826", "AffiliationName": "Brain Innovation"}, "57217286292": {"Name": "Fritz L.", "AuthorID": "57217286292", "AffiliationID": "60114826", "AffiliationName": "Brain Innovation"}, "46061141600": {"Name": "Eck J.", "AuthorID": "46061141600", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience, Maastricht University"}, "7102516398": {"Name": "Goebel R.", "AuthorID": "7102516398", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience, Maastricht University"}, "56333016200": {"Name": "Peters J.", "AuthorID": "56333016200", "AffiliationID": "60027919, 60014578", "AffiliationName": "Department of Vision and Cognition, Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience, An Institute of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW)"}, "6508170986": {"Name": "Roebroeck A.", "AuthorID": "6508170986", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience, Maastricht University"}, "26326469000": {"Name": "Pyles J.", "AuthorID": "26326469000", "AffiliationID": "60027950, 60136673", "AffiliationName": "Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, Carnegie Mellon University"}, "55295726500": {"Name": "Bastiani M.", "AuthorID": "55295726500", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging, University of Oxford"}, "7004536701": {"Name": "Ashburner J.", "AuthorID": "7004536701", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "The Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, University College London"}}}
