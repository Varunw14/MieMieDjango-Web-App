Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd | Biology Open (2020) 9, bio054304. doi:10.1242/bio.054304The Arp2/3 complex regulates many cellular processes by stimulating formation of branched actin filament networks. Because three of its seven subunits exist as two different isoforms, mammals produce a family of Arp2/3 complexes with different properties that may be suited to different physiological contexts. To shed light on how isoform diversification affects Arp2/3 function, we determined a 4.2 \u00c5 resolution cryo-EM structure of the most active human Arp2/3 complex containing ARPC1B and ARPC5L, and compared it with the structure of the least active ARPC1A-ARPC5-containing complex. The architecture of each isoform-specific Arp2/3 complex is the same. Strikingly, however, the N-terminal half of ARPC5L is partially disordered compared to ARPC5, suggesting that this region of ARPC5/ARPC5L is an important determinant of complex activity. Confirming this idea, the nucleation activity of Arp2/3 complexes containing hybrid ARPC5/ARPC5L subunits is higher when the ARPC5L N-terminus is present, thereby providing insight into activity differences between the different Arp2/3 complexes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Actin", "Arp2/3", "Cryo-EM", "Cytoskeleton", "Isoforms", "Nucleation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089840997", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"44462114700": {"Name": "von Loeffelholz O.", "AuthorID": "44462114700", "AffiliationID": "122324576", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Integrative Biology, Department of Integrated Structural Biology, Institute of Genetics and of Molecular and Cellular Biology"}, "6701857441": {"Name": "Moores C.A.", "AuthorID": "6701857441", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College"}, "6602710836": {"Name": "Purkiss A.", "AuthorID": "6602710836", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Francis Crick Institute"}, "24335111400": {"Name": "Kjaer S.", "AuthorID": "24335111400", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Francis Crick Institute"}, "11139286900": {"Name": "Kogata N.", "AuthorID": "11139286900", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Francis Crick Institute"}, "7005063256": {"Name": "Way M.", "AuthorID": "7005063256", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London"}, "57203499804": {"Name": "Cao L.", "AuthorID": "57203499804", "AffiliationID": "60008134, 60005370", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Paris, CNRS, Institut Jacques Monod"}, "11339131400": {"Name": "Romet-Lemonne G.", "AuthorID": "11339131400", "AffiliationID": "60008134, 60005370", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Paris, CNRS, Institut Jacques Monod"}}}
