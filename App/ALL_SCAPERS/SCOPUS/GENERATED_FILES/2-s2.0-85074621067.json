Sufficiency, Justice, and Health comprises fifteen original contributions which explore the possibility of a sufficientarian approach to healthcare priority setting and resource allocation. Sufficientarianism is a well-established theory of distributive justice, which tells us that justice requires that each person has \"enough,\" and assigns particular importance to a threshold level of goods under which no person must fall. Sufficiency is under-explored as a distributive principle in the healthcare context, and this book makes a strong case for its inclusion among more familiar principles of justice such as utility, priority to the worst off, and equality.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Capabilities", "Distributive justice", "Health", "Sufficiency"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074621067", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"]], "AuthorData": {"57193730546": {"Name": "Mitchell P.", "AuthorID": "57193730546", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Education, Communication & Society, King's College London"}}}
