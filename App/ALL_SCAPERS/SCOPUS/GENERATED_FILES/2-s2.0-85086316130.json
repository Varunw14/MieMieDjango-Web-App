Methods: Electronic multiple choice survey of parents of children who had undergone craniosynostosis surgery in infancy using 5-point Likert scales. Results: Fifty-nine completed surveys were obtained from parents of children who had undergone previous craniosynostosis surgery. Mean age of children was 7.8 years (range 3 months to 22 years), with 36 non-syndromic and 23 syndromic cases. The most common surgery was fronto-orbital remodelling (18). Fifty-two of 59 were involved in athletic activity. The most intense sport type was non-contact in 23, light contact in 20, heavy contact in 4 and combat in 5. Participation level was school mandatory in 12, school club in 17, non-school sport club in 21 and regional representative in 2. One child had been advised to avoid sport by an external physician. Mean anxiety (1\u20135 Likert) increased with sport intensity: non-contact 1.7, light contact 2.2, heavy contact 3.5 and combat 3.6. Twenty-nine of 59 parents had been given specific advice by the Craniofacial Team regarding athletic activity, 28 of which found useful. Three sport-related head injuries were reported, none of which required hospitalisation. Conclusion: Little information exists regarding sports for children after craniosynostosis surgery. This study suggests that parental anxiety remains high, particularly for high impact/combat sports, and that parents would like more information from clinicians about the safety of post-operative sporting activities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anxiety", "Craniofacial surgery", "Craniosynostosis", "Quality of life", "Sports"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086316130", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57216776500": {"Name": "Rotimi O.", "AuthorID": "57216776500", "AffiliationID": "60033002", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Medway Maritime Hospital"}, "57217116040": {"Name": "Jung G.Y.P.", "AuthorID": "57217116040", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Medical School, University College London"}, "10739531300": {"Name": "Ong J.", "AuthorID": "10739531300", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "55401970300": {"Name": "Jeelani N.U.O.", "AuthorID": "55401970300", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7003742514": {"Name": "Dunaway D.J.", "AuthorID": "7003742514", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "54398602100": {"Name": "James G.", "AuthorID": "54398602100", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
