Despite this, there has been little systematic research into the implications of the timing of calcification or the duration of each moult stage. Consequently, it is unclear whether palaeoenvironmental reconstructions are recording restricted (inter-seasonal) time periods or reflect the mean annual conditions. The seasonality of shell formation can therefore have implications for palaeoenvironmental reconstructions based on geochemical signatures, especially palaeotemperature, particularly in environments that show large inter-annual variations in water conditions. Cyprideis torosa is a geographically widespread and eurytopic species that has great potential for a range of palaeoenvironmental reconstructions, but inhabits environments with large seasonal and inter-annual variation. Using hourly water and air temperature data, ostracod shell and surface water chemistry from a shallow coastal pond in SE UK, we improve knowledge of the timing of Cyprideis torosa calcification, and thus our understanding of the potential seasonality of signals in palaeotemperature datasets. We suggest seasonal calcification in spring and autumn, with persistence at the adult life stage for up to 12\u201318 months. Sr/Ca values of C. torosa appear to reflect a Sr/Cawater control on calcification timing and have no temperature dependence. For Mg/Ca, we show a minimum temperature control on calcification of 7 \u00b0C, with C. torosa Mg/Ca-inferred temperatures broadly tracking spring and autumn temperatures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Calcification", "Cyprideis torosa", "Life cycle", "Mg/Ca", "Ostracods", "Palaeotemperature"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079186802", "SubjectAreas": [["Oceanography", "EART", "1910"], ["Paleontology", "EART", "1911"]], "AuthorData": {"57202208762": {"Name": "Roberts L.R.", "AuthorID": "57202208762", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Research Centre, Department of Geography, University College London"}, "7102585670": {"Name": "Horne D.J.", "AuthorID": "7102585670", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Queen Mary, University of London"}, "7403240604": {"Name": "Holmes J.A.", "AuthorID": "7403240604", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Research Centre, Department of Geography, University College London"}}}
