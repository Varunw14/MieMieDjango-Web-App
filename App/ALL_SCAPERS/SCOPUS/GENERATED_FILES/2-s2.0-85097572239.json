We also explored the factors that doctors currently approaching the end of their 2-year program believe should be considered. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted during the 2013\u20132014 academic year. An online questionnaire was distributed to 2092 final-year medical students from nine UK medical schools and 84 foundation year-2 (FY2) doctors from eight foundation schools. Participants were asked to rank their top 3 from a list of 12 factors that could potentially influence choice of foundation school on a 5-point Likert scale. Collated categorical data from the two groups were compared using a chi-square test with Yates correction. Results: Geographic location was overwhelmingly the most important factor for medical students and FY2 doctors with 97.2% and 98.8% in agreement, respectively. Social relationships played a pivotal role for medical student applicants. Clinical specialties within the rotations were of less importance to medical students, in comparison to location and social relationships. In contrast, FY2 doctors placed a significantly greater importance on the specialties undertaken in their 2-year training program, when compared to medical students (chi-square; p=0.0001). Conclusion: UK medical schools should make their foundation program applicants aware of the importance of choosing rotations based on specialties that will be undertaken. Individual foundation schools could provide a more favorable linked application system and greater choice and flexibility of specialties within their 2-year program, potentially making their institution more attractive to future applicants.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Foundation school", "Location of training", "Social relationships", "UK postgraduate training"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85097572239", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"35203878900": {"Name": "Miah S.", "AuthorID": "35203878900", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60012558", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Charing Cross Hospital Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "57221048161": {"Name": "Pang K.H.", "AuthorID": "57221048161", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Academic Urology Unit, University of Sheffield"}, "56422391700": {"Name": "Rebello W.", "AuthorID": "56422391700", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Medical School, University of Sheffield"}, "56422201000": {"Name": "Rubakumar Z.", "AuthorID": "56422201000", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Medical School, University of Sheffield"}, "56421959500": {"Name": "Begum H.", "AuthorID": "56421959500", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Medical School, University of Sheffield"}, "56658410100": {"Name": "Fung V.", "AuthorID": "56658410100", "AffiliationID": "60006444", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic Surgery, Royal Hallamshire Hospital"}, "36239630500": {"Name": "Venugopal S.", "AuthorID": "36239630500", "AffiliationID": "105265159", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Chesterfield Royal Infirmary"}}}
