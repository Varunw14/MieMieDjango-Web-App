This study focuses on their legal effects vis-\u00e0-vis the interpretation of treaties, and explores how the International Court of Justice and the International Law Commission have dealt with the pronouncements of expert treaty bodies in relation to the interpretation of treaties. The tale about the Court's and the Commission's approaches in this respect demonstrates the profound belief of both the Court and the Commission that international law is a legal system, which calls for reliance on the pronouncements of expert treaty bodies as integral actors within the legal system with some 'authority' concerning the determination of the law (within their mandate). This does not mean that the Court and the Commission support a 'blind reliance' on such pronouncements; rather the quality of each pronouncement is a criterion for relying on it. The reasoning of the Court and (and implicitly of) the Commission also shows that they consider that international law as a legal system, which necessitates 'legal consistency'. This in turn suggests that the reliance on pronouncements of expert treaty bodies, which are mandated to supervise the application (and interpretation) of particular treaties, may constitute an exercise of 'systemic integration' which exceeds the confines of the rule set forth in Article 31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Criteria for relying on pronouncements of expert treaty bodies", "Expert treaty bodies", "International Court of Justice", "International Law Commission", "Systemic integration", "Treaty interpretation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082519146", "SubjectAreas": [["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"57212147031": {"Name": "Azaria D.", "AuthorID": "57212147031", "AffiliationID": "60104346", "AffiliationName": "European Research Council, Project \u201cState Silence\u201d"}}}
