Methods: An analysis of linked electronic health and council records of adults living in the borough of Barking and Dagenham, east London, for the financial year 2016/17. Unit costs were applied to individual service use to provide expenditure at an individual and population level for five settings of care. Population and expenditure volumes were compared for 32 possible combinations of service use. Results: The total expenditure for the cohort (114,393 residents) for 2016/17 was \u00a3180.1 million. Almost half (47%) of total expenditure was incurred by community care, social care and mental health services, with hospital care and primary care incurring, respectively, 35% (\u00a363.3 m) and 18% (\u00a332.6 m). The two most common combinations in terms of total population volume and expenditure were primary and hospital care, and primary, hospital and community care. Primary care was present in all combinations. Mental health service use accounted for just over a tenth of all expenditure in the borough, but using mental health services substantially increased mean expenditure per patient. Conclusions: A whole system perspective across all settings of care improves understanding of service user patterns. Setting-level analysis remains important, particularly for mental health users.", "AuthorKeywords": ["health and care service utilisation", "integrated health care systems", "linked data sets"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087300817", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57195904922": {"Name": "Shand J.", "AuthorID": "57195904922", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "PhD Researcher, Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, University College London"}, "57220828646": {"Name": "Morris S.", "AuthorID": "57220828646", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "RAND Professor of Health Services Research, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge"}, "19835038000": {"Name": "Gomes M.", "AuthorID": "19835038000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Associate Professor in Health Economics, Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, University College London"}}}
