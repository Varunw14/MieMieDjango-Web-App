Because the enamel is weaker, teeth can undergo post eruptive breakdown, resulting in missing enamel. Enamel hypoplasia is a quantitative defect of the enamel presenting as pits, grooves, missing enamel or smaller teeth. It can sometimes be difficult to differentiate between the two. In this review paper, we aim to explain the importance of differentiating between the two conditions, and how to manage patients presenting with enamel defects.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Abnormalities, Multiple", "Dental Enamel", "Dental Enamel Hypoplasia", "Humans", "Tooth Demineralization", "Tooth Eruption"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074126563", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"57192281757": {"Name": "Patel A.", "AuthorID": "57192281757", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Dentistry, Eastman Dental Hospital"}, "57211486120": {"Name": "Aghababaie S.", "AuthorID": "57211486120", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Dentistry, Eastman Dental Hospital"}, "14010574900": {"Name": "Parekh S.", "AuthorID": "14010574900", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Dentistry, Eastman Dental Hospital"}}}
