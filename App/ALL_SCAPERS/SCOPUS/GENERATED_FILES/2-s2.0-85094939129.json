This review provides an overview of global policies that optimize development, licensing, pricing, and reimbursement of orphan drugs. Methods: Pharmaceutical legislation and policies related to access and regulation of orphan drugs were examined from 194 World Health Organization member countries and 6 areas. Orphan drug policies (ODPs) were identified through internet search, emails to national pharmacovigilance centers, and systematic academic literature search. Texts from selected publications were extracted for content analysis. Results: One hundred seventy-two drug regulation documents and 77 academic publications from 162 countries/areas were included. Ninety-two of 200 countries/areas (46.0%) had documentation on ODPs. Thirty-four subthemes from content analysis were categorized into 6 policy themes, namely, orphan drug designation, marketing authorization, safety and efficacy requirements, price regulation, incentives that encourage market availability, and incentives that encourage research and development. Countries/areas with ODPs were statistically wealthier (gross national income per capita = $10 875 vs $3950, P <.001). Country/area income was also positively correlated with the scope of the respective ODP (correlation coefficient = 0.57, P <.001). Conclusions: Globally, the number of countries with an ODP has grown rapidly since 2013. Nevertheless, disparities in geographical distribution and income levels affect the establishment of ODPs. Furthermore, identified policy gaps in price regulation, incentives that encourage market availability, and incentives that encourage research and development should be addressed to improve access to available and affordable orphan drugs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["drug regulatory", "health equity", "orphan drug policy", "rare diseases", "treatment access"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094939129", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57219337506": {"Name": "Chan A.Y.L.", "AuthorID": "57219337506", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong"}, "57219338802": {"Name": "Chan V.K.Y.", "AuthorID": "57219338802", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong"}, "57219721765": {"Name": "Fan M.", "AuthorID": "57219721765", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong"}, "57209293671": {"Name": "Ge M.", "AuthorID": "57209293671", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong"}, "57193202242": {"Name": "Pathadka S.", "AuthorID": "57193202242", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong"}, "55657652100": {"Name": "Chui C.S.L.", "AuthorID": "55657652100", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Work and Social Administration, Faculty of Social Sciences, The University of Hong Kong"}, "14043219000": {"Name": "Chan E.W.", "AuthorID": "14043219000", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong"}, "7102513915": {"Name": "Wong I.C.K.", "AuthorID": "7102513915", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60016379", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medicines Optimisation Research and Education, Research Department of Policy and Practice, University College London School of Pharmacy and University College London Hospital"}, "57188815949": {"Name": "Li X.", "AuthorID": "57188815949", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Work and Social Administration, Faculty of Social Sciences, The University of Hong Kong"}, "7202622867": {"Name": "Olsson S.", "AuthorID": "7202622867", "AffiliationID": "101255350", "AffiliationName": "International Society of Pharmacovigilance"}, "23990626200": {"Name": "Jit M.", "AuthorID": "23990626200", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong"}, "55638308200": {"Name": "Gong M.", "AuthorID": "55638308200", "AffiliationID": "60122781", "AffiliationName": "Rare Diseases Research Center, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"}, "57204934979": {"Name": "Zhang S.", "AuthorID": "57204934979", "AffiliationID": "60008706", "AffiliationName": "Peking Union Medical College Hospital"}, "57203724955": {"Name": "Chung C.C.Y.", "AuthorID": "57203724955", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong"}, "57219023026": {"Name": "Chung B.H.Y.", "AuthorID": "57219023026", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong"}, "7003622681": {"Name": "Ip P.", "AuthorID": "7003622681", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong"}, "24465754400": {"Name": "Wong G.H.Y.", "AuthorID": "24465754400", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Sau Po Centre on Ageing, The University of Hong Kong"}, "55358910800": {"Name": "Lum T.Y.", "AuthorID": "55358910800", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Sau Po Centre on Ageing, The University of Hong Kong"}}}
