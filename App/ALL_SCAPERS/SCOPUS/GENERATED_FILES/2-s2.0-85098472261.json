We examined whether self-rated health of adults who had been in non-parental care up to 30 years later varied by type of care. Methods: We used longitudinal data from the office for National Statistics Longitudinal Study. Participants were aged <18 and never-married at baseline of each census year from 1971 to 2001. Separately for each follow-up period (10, 20 and 30 years later), multi-level logistic regression was used to compare self-rated health outcomes by different care types. Results: For combined census years, sample sizes were 157 896 dependent children with 10 years of follow-up, 166 844 with 20 years of follow-up and 173 801 with 30 years of follow-up. For all follow-up cohorts, longitudinal study members who had been in care in childhood, had higher odds of rating their health as 'not good' vs. 'good'; with highest odds for residential care. For example, 10-year follow-up odds ratios were 3.5 (95% confidence interval: 2.2-5.6) for residential care, 2.1 (1.7-2.5) for relative households and 2.6 (2.1-3.3) for non-relative households, compared with parental households after adjustment for childhood demographics. Associations were weakest for 10-year, and strongest for 20-year, follow-up. Additional adjustment for childhood social circumstances reduced, but did not eliminate, associations. Conclusion: Decades after children and young people are placed in care, they are still more likely to report worse health than children who grew up in a parental household.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85098472261", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"36632716100": {"Name": "Murray E.T.", "AuthorID": "36632716100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "54410939600": {"Name": "Lacey R.", "AuthorID": "54410939600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "6603689750": {"Name": "Sacker A.", "AuthorID": "6603689750", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7004464071": {"Name": "Maughan B.", "AuthorID": "7004464071", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, King's College London"}}}
