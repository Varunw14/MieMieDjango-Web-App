Its traditional definition, based on colour, rests on a number of assumptions that can be subjected to non-Trivial systematics. In Angthopo, Ferreras & Silk (2019), we proposed a new definition of the GV based on the 4000 \u00c5 break strength. In this paper, we explore in detail the properties of the underlying stellar populations by use of \u223c230 thousand high-quality spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), contrasting our results with a traditional approach via dust-corrected colours. We explore high-quality stacked SDSS spectra, and find a population trend that suggests a substantial difference between low-and high-mass galaxies, with the former featuring younger populations with star formation quenching, and the latter showing older (post-quenching) populations that include rejuvenation events. Subtle but measurable differences are found between a colour-based approach and our definition, especially as our selection of GV galaxies produces a cleaner 'stratification' of the GV, with more homogeneous population properties within sections of the GV. Our definition based on 4000 \u00c5 break strength gives a clean representation of the transition to quiescence, easily measurable in the upcoming and future spectroscopic surveys.", "AuthorKeywords": ["galaxies: evolution", "galaxies: formation", "galaxies: interactions", "galaxies: stellar content"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091962443", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57195869724": {"Name": "Angthopo J.", "AuthorID": "57195869724", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "7004053948": {"Name": "Ferreras I.", "AuthorID": "7004053948", "AffiliationID": "60011125", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Astrof\u00edsica de Canarias"}, "7101639421": {"Name": "Silk J.", "AuthorID": "7101639421", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Johns Hopkins University Homewood Campus"}}}
