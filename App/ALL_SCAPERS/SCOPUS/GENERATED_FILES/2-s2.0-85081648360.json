To test this claim, we investigated how experienced outcomes triggering loss and regret impacted people\u2019s tendency to decide alone or join a group, and how decisions differed when voluntarily made alone versus in group. Replicated across two experiments, participants (n = 125 and n = 496) selected whether to play alone or contribute their vote to a group decision. Next, they chose between two lotteries with different probabilities of winning and losing. The higher the negative outcome, the more participants switched from deciding alone to with others. When joining a group to choose the lottery, choices were less driven by outcome and regret anticipation. Moreover, negative outcomes experienced alone, not part of a group vote, led to worse subsequent choices than positive outcomes. These results suggest that the protective shield of the collective reduces the influence of negative emotions that may help individuals re-evaluate past choices.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Joining groups", "Loss", "Negative outcomes", "Regret", "Responsibility"], "IndexKeywords": ["Choice Behavior", "Decision Making", "Emotions", "Humans", "Motivation", "Social Behavior"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85081648360", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"56429298300": {"Name": "El Zein M.", "AuthorID": "56429298300", "AffiliationID": "60026562", "AffiliationName": "Center for Adaptive Rationality, Max Planck Institute for Human Development"}, "6602660978": {"Name": "Bahrami B.", "AuthorID": "6602660978", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway, University of London"}}}
