American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.Several seismic and numerical studies proposed that below, some hotspots upper-mantle plumelets rise from a thermal boundary layer below 660 km depth, fed by a deeper plume source. We recently found tomographic evidence of multiple upper-mantle upwellings, spaced by several 100 km, rising through the transition zone below the northern East African Rift. To better test this interpretation, we run 3-D numerical simulations of mantle convection for Newtonian and non-Newtonian rheologies, for both thermal instabilities rising from a lower boundary layer, and the destabilization of a thermal anomaly placed at the base of the box (700\u2013800 km depth). The thermal structures are converted to seismic velocities using a thermodynamic approach. Resolution tests are then conducted for the same P and S data distribution and inversion parameters as our traveltime tomography. The Rayleigh Taylor models predict simultaneous plumelets in different stages of evolution rising from a hot layer located below the transition zone, resulting in seismic structure that looks more complex than the simple vertical cylinders that are often anticipated. From the wide selection of models tested, we find that the destabilization of a 200 \u00b0C, 100 km thick thermal anomaly with a non-Newtonian rheology, most closely matches the magnitude and the spatial and temporal distribution of the anomalies below the rift. Finally, we find that for reasonable upper-mantle viscosities, the synthetic plume structures are similar in scale and shape to the actual low-velocity anomalies, providing further support for the existence of upper-mantle plumelets below the northern East African Rift.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dynamic modeling", "mantle plumes", "Rayleigh Taylor", "thermal anomaly", "thermal boundary layer", "tomography"], "IndexKeywords": ["3-D numerical simulation", "Mantle plume", "Non-Newtonian rheology", "Rayleigh-Taylor", "Spatial and temporal distribution", "Thermal anomalies", "Thermal boundary layer", "Thermodynamic approaches"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076919942", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"56841629500": {"Name": "Civiero C.", "AuthorID": "56841629500", "AffiliationID": "60018271", "AffiliationName": "Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies (DIAS)"}, "37068668200": {"Name": "Armitage J.J.", "AuthorID": "37068668200", "AffiliationID": "60001970", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Physique du Globe, Universit\u00e9 de Paris"}, "7003945305": {"Name": "Goes S.", "AuthorID": "7003945305", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "24764933600": {"Name": "Hammond J.O.S.", "AuthorID": "24764933600", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}}}
