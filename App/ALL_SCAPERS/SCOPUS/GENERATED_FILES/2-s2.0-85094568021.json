All rights reserved.The Zebrafish in Biomedical Research: Biology, Husbandry, Diseases, and Research Applications is a comprehensive work that fulfills a critical need for a thorough compilation of information on this species. The text provides significant updates for working vivarium professionals maintaining zebrafish colonies, veterinarians responsible for their care and well-being, zoologists and ethologists studying the species, and investigators using the species to gain critical insights into human physiology and disease. As the zebrafish has become an important model organism for the study of vertebrate development and disease, organ function, behavior, toxicology, cancer, and drug discovery, this book presents an important resource for future research.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094568021", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"6602766783": {"Name": "Cartner S.C.", "AuthorID": "6602766783", "AffiliationID": "60027086", "AffiliationName": "University of Alabama at Birmingham"}, "55255373700": {"Name": "Farmer S.C.", "AuthorID": "55255373700", "AffiliationID": "60027086", "AffiliationName": "University of Alabama at Birmingham"}, "7102780229": {"Name": "Kent M.L.", "AuthorID": "7102780229", "AffiliationID": "60013402", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Microbiology and Biomedical Sciences, Oregon State University"}, "7102241346": {"Name": "Eisen J.S.", "AuthorID": "7102241346", "AffiliationID": "60012317", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience, University of Oregon"}, "6602609258": {"Name": "Guillemin K.J.", "AuthorID": "6602609258", "AffiliationID": "105227281", "AffiliationName": "CIFAR"}, "7201414626": {"Name": "Sanders G.E.", "AuthorID": "7201414626", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Comparative Medicine, University of Washington"}}}
