Liver International published by John Wiley & Sons LtdBackground and Aims: The enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) score comprises serum markers of fibrogenesis and matrix remodelling and was developed to detect liver fibrosis, however, it may also be useful for the non-invasive detection of portal hypertension (PHT). Methods: ELF score and its single components (TIMP1/PIIINP/HA) were analysed in 201 patients with advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD; ie hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) \u22656 mm Hg). Patients with pre-/post-hepatic PHT, hepatocellular carcinoma beyond Milan criteria, and history of TIPS implantation or liver transplantation were excluded. Results: ELF and its single components correlated with HVPG in the overall cohort: ELF: r =.443, TIMP1: r =.368, PIIINP:r =.332, and HA:r =.419 (all P <.001). The strength of the correlation between ELF and HVPG decreased in higher HVPG strata: 6-9 mm Hg:r =.569(P =.004), 10-19 mm Hg:r =.304 (P =.001) and \u226520 mm Hg:r = \u2212.023(P =.853). Area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) of ELF score to detect clinically significant PHT (CSPH; HVPG \u2265 10 mm Hg) was 0.833. Importantly, HA alone yielded an AUROC of 0.828. Detection of CSPH in strictly compensated ACLD (cACLD) patients was less accurate: AUROC: 0.759 (P <.001). CSPH was ruled-in by ELF \u2265 11.1 with a PPV of 98% (sensitivity: 61%/specificity: 92%/NPV:24%), but CSPH could not be ruled-out. ELF score had a low AUROC of 0.677 (0.60-0.75; P <.001) for the diagnosis of high-risk PHT (HRPH; HVPG \u2265 20mm Hg) and, thus, HRPH could not be ruled-in by ELF. However, ELF < 10.1 ruled-out HRPH with a NPV of 95% (sensitivity: 97%/specificity: 26%/PPV: 39%). Conclusion: The ELF score correlates with HVPG at values <20 mm Hg. An ELF \u2265 11.1 identifies patients with a high probability of CSPH, while an ELF < 10.1 may be used to rule-out HRPH.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ACLD", "advanced chronic liver disease", "cirrhosis", "clinically significant portal hypertension", "hepatic venous pressure gradient", "non-invasive", "portal hypertension", "prediction"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084804118", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"]], "AuthorData": {"56658776100": {"Name": "Simbrunner B.", "AuthorID": "56658776100", "AffiliationID": "60003156", "AffiliationName": "CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"}, "55803009600": {"Name": "Scheiner B.", "AuthorID": "55803009600", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Laboratory, Medical University of Vienna"}, "35485391200": {"Name": "Schwabl P.", "AuthorID": "35485391200", "AffiliationID": "60003156", "AffiliationName": "CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"}, "56176028800": {"Name": "Bucsics T.", "AuthorID": "56176028800", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Laboratory, Medical University of Vienna"}, "57195417369": {"Name": "Stadlmann A.", "AuthorID": "57195417369", "AffiliationID": "101034254", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Hietzing"}, "57195487529": {"Name": "Bauer D.J.M.", "AuthorID": "57195487529", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Laboratory, Medical University of Vienna"}, "56521656600": {"Name": "Paternostro R.", "AuthorID": "56521656600", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Laboratory, Medical University of Vienna"}, "25226313400": {"Name": "Pinter M.", "AuthorID": "25226313400", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna"}, "36769160400": {"Name": "St\u00e4ttermayer A.F.", "AuthorID": "36769160400", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna"}, "7006061605": {"Name": "Trauner M.", "AuthorID": "7006061605", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna"}, "55369068500": {"Name": "Mandorfer M.", "AuthorID": "55369068500", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Laboratory, Medical University of Vienna"}, "24315181000": {"Name": "Reiberger T.", "AuthorID": "24315181000", "AffiliationID": "60003156", "AffiliationName": "CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences"}, "7003758775": {"Name": "Marculescu R.", "AuthorID": "7003758775", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna"}, "7801395921": {"Name": "Eigenbauer E.", "AuthorID": "7801395921", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "IT-Systems & Communications, Medical University of Vienna"}}}
