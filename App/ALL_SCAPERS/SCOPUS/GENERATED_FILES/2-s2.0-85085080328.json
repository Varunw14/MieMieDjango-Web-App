However, the precise contribution of specific immune effector and immune suppressor components of the TME in Burkitt lymphoma (BL) remains poorly understood. Methods: In this paper, we applied the computational algorithm CIBERSORT to Gene Expression Profiling (GEP) datasets of 40 BL samples to draw a map of immune and stromal components of TME. Furthermore, by multiple immunohistochemistry (IHC) and multispectral immunofluorescence (IF), we investigated the TME of additional series of 40 BL cases to evaluate the role of the Programmed Death-1 and Programmed Death Ligand-1 (PD-1/PD-L1) immune checkpoint axis. Results: Our results indicate that M2 polarized macrophages are the most prominent TME component in BL. In addition, we investigated the correlation between PD-L1 and latent membrane protein-2A (LMP2A) expression on tumour cells, highlighting a subgroup of BL cases characterized by a non-canonical latency program of EBV with an activated PD-L1 pathway. Conclusion: In conclusion, our study analysed the TME in BL and identified a tolerogenic immune signature highlighting new potential therapeutic targets.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Burkitt lymphoma", "EBV", "Immune checkpoint", "Immunotherapy", "PD-L1", "Tumour microenvironment"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085080328", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"57193948513": {"Name": "Granai M.", "AuthorID": "57193948513", "AffiliationID": "60022653", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital of T\u00fcbingen, Institute of Pathology"}, "56123805100": {"Name": "Mundo L.", "AuthorID": "56123805100", "AffiliationID": "60002838", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biotechnology, University of Siena"}, "57216885618": {"Name": "Siciliano M.C.", "AuthorID": "57216885618", "AffiliationID": "60002838", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biotechnology, University of Siena"}, "56528060400": {"Name": "Mancini V.", "AuthorID": "56528060400", "AffiliationID": "60002838", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biotechnology, University of Siena"}, "21640041500": {"Name": "Lazzi S.", "AuthorID": "21640041500", "AffiliationID": "60002838", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biotechnology, University of Siena"}, "7005774545": {"Name": "Leoncini L.", "AuthorID": "7005774545", "AffiliationID": "60002838", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biotechnology, University of Siena"}, "7003308935": {"Name": "Quintanilla-Martinez L.", "AuthorID": "7003308935", "AffiliationID": "60022653", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital of T\u00fcbingen, Institute of Pathology"}, "7005995120": {"Name": "Fend F.", "AuthorID": "7005995120", "AffiliationID": "60022653", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital of T\u00fcbingen, Institute of Pathology"}, "55789555400": {"Name": "Akarca A.U.", "AuthorID": "55789555400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University College London"}, "57218122723": {"Name": "Marafioti T.", "AuthorID": "57218122723", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cellular Pathology, University College Hospital"}, "12239464300": {"Name": "Rizvi H.", "AuthorID": "12239464300", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cellular Pathology, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "56045880500": {"Name": "Onyango N.", "AuthorID": "56045880500", "AffiliationID": "60048717", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Medicine and Therapeutics, University of Nairobi"}, "6508185856": {"Name": "Abinya N.O.", "AuthorID": "6508185856", "AffiliationID": "60048717", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Medicine and Therapeutics, University of Nairobi"}, "8530805400": {"Name": "Nyagol J.", "AuthorID": "8530805400", "AffiliationID": "60048717", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Pathology, University of Nairobi"}, "57216877323": {"Name": "Maha I.", "AuthorID": "57216877323", "AffiliationID": "60000617", "AffiliationName": "South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assiut University"}, "57202463819": {"Name": "Margielewska S.", "AuthorID": "57202463819", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Durham University"}, "57216881036": {"Name": "Wi W.", "AuthorID": "57216881036", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Durham University"}, "6602785635": {"Name": "Bibas M.", "AuthorID": "6602785635", "AffiliationID": "60072494", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Department, National Institute for Infectious Diseases Lazzaro Spallanzani I.R.C.C.S"}, "7003513000": {"Name": "Piccaluga P.P.", "AuthorID": "7003513000", "AffiliationID": "60017697, 60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental, Diagnostic, and Specialty Medicine Bologna University Medical School, S.
