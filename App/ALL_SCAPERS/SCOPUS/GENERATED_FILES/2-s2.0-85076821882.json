This is partly due to the resistance of the disease to currently available treatment options. Herein, we report for the first time the use of a novel polyurethane scaffold based PDAC model for screening the short and relatively long term (1 and 17 days post-treatment) responses of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and their combination. We show a dose dependent cell viability reduction and apoptosis induction for both chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Furthermore, we observe a change in the impact of the treatment depending on the time-frame, especially for radiation for which the PDAC scaffolds showed resistance after 1 day but responded more 17 days post-treatment. This is the first study to report a viable PDAC culture in a scaffold for more than 2 months and the first to perform long-term (17 days) post-treatment observations in vitro. This is particularly important as a longer time-frame is much closer to animal studies and to patient treatment regimes, highlighting that our scaffold system has great potential to be used as an animal free model for screening of PDAC.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Apoptosis induction", "Biomimetic polymers", "Cell viability", "Ductal adenocarcinomas", "Longer time frames", "Pancreatic cancers", "Polyurethane scaffolds", "Scaffold system"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076821882", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"57211559776": {"Name": "Gupta P.", "AuthorID": "57211559776", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Bioprocess and Biochemical Engineering Group (BioProChem), Department of Chemical and Process Engineering, University of Surrey"}, "57193311246": {"Name": "Totti S.", "AuthorID": "57193311246", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Bioprocess and Biochemical Engineering Group (BioProChem), Department of Chemical and Process Engineering, University of Surrey"}, "24765731400": {"Name": "Velliou E.G.", "AuthorID": "24765731400", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Bioprocess and Biochemical Engineering Group (BioProChem), Department of Chemical and Process Engineering, University of Surrey"}, "6506454672": {"Name": "P\u00e9rez-Mancera P.A.", "AuthorID": "6506454672", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool Ashton Street"}, "57212484477": {"Name": "Dyke E.", "AuthorID": "57212484477", "AffiliationID": "60028760", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics, Royal Surrey County Hospital, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005065727": {"Name": "Nisbet A.", "AuthorID": "7005065727", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Surrey"}, "35576798300": {"Name": "Schettino G.", "AuthorID": "35576798300", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "Medical Radiation Science Group, National Physical Laboratory"}, "7403006881": {"Name": "Webb R.", "AuthorID": "7403006881", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Ion Beam Centre, University of Surrey"}}}
