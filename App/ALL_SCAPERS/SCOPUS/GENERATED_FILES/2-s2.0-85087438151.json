The challenges associated with COVID-19 are even greater for patients with light chain (AL) amyloidosis, a rare multisystemic disease affecting the heart, kidneys, liver, gastrointestinal and nervous system. Patients with AL amyloidosis may need to receive chemotherapy, which probably increases infection risk. Management of COVID-19 may be particularly challenging in patients with AL amyloidosis, who often present with cardiac dysfunction, nephrotic syndrome, neuropathy, low blood pressure and gastrointestinal symptoms. In addition, patients with AL amyloidosis may be more susceptible to toxicities of drugs used to manage COVID-19. Access to health care may be difficult or limited, diagnosis of AL amyloidosis may be delayed with detrimental consequences and treatment administration may need modification. Both patients and treating physicians need to adapt in a new reality.", "AuthorKeywords": ["amyloidosis", "COVID-19", "hydroxychloroquine", "remdesivir", "tocilizumab"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antiviral Agents", "Betacoronavirus", "Coronavirus Infections", "Health Services Accessibility", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin Light-chain Amyloidosis", "Immunologic Factors", "Pandemics", "Pneumonia, Viral"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087438151", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"8504977900": {"Name": "Kastritis E.", "AuthorID": "8504977900", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Plasma Cell Dyscrasia Unit, Department of Clinical Therapeutics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "7102289951": {"Name": "Dimopoulos M.A.", "AuthorID": "7102289951", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Plasma Cell Dyscrasia Unit, Department of Clinical Therapeutics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "6506002568": {"Name": "Wechalekar A.", "AuthorID": "6506002568", "AffiliationID": "100625962", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre"}, "9039955100": {"Name": "Sch\u00f6nland S.", "AuthorID": "9039955100", "AffiliationID": "60003280", "AffiliationName": "Medical Department V, Amyloidosis Centre, University Hospital Heidelberg"}, "6603808827": {"Name": "Hegenbart U.", "AuthorID": "6603808827", "AffiliationID": "60003280", "AffiliationName": "Medical Department V, Amyloidosis Centre, University Hospital Heidelberg"}, "6602720124": {"Name": "Sanchorawala V.", "AuthorID": "6602720124", "AffiliationID": "60003526, 60019674", "AffiliationName": "Amyloidosis Center, School of Medicine and Boston Medical Center, Boston University"}, "7006059649": {"Name": "Merlini G.", "AuthorID": "7006059649", "AffiliationID": "60015197, 60026556", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Amyloidosis Research and Treatment Center, Foundation \u201cIstituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Policlinico San Matteo\u201d, University of Pavia"}, "7006442443": {"Name": "Palladini G.", "AuthorID": "7006442443", "AffiliationID": "60015197, 60026556", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Amyloidosis Research and Treatment Center, Foundation \u201cIstituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Policlinico San Matteo\u201d, University of Pavia"}, "6602185439": {"Name": "Minnema M.", "AuthorID": "6602185439", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hematology, UMC Utrecht Cancer Center"}, "25422947300": {"Name": "Roussel M.", "AuthorID": "25422947300", "AffiliationID": "60024960", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Hematology, IUC Oncopole/CHU Toulouse"}, "7003722388": {"Name": "Jaccard A.", "AuthorID": "7003722388", "AffiliationID": "60020859", "AffiliationName": "CHU Poitiers"}, "8332091800": {"Name": "Kumar S.", "AuthorID": "8332091800", "AffiliationID": "60005558", "AffiliationName": "Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic"}, "8961915700": {"Name": "Cibeira M.T.", "AuthorID": "8961915700", "AffiliationID": "60001576, 60030315, 60010814", "AffiliationName": "Hematology Department, Amyloidosis and Myeloma Unit, Hospital Cl\u00ednic of Barcelona, University of Barcelona, IDIBAPS"}, "55906349600": {"Name": "Blade J.", "AuthorID": "55906349600", "AffiliationID": "60001576, 60030315, 60010814", "AffiliationName": "Hematology Department, Amyloidosis and Myeloma Unit, Hospital Cl\u00ednic of Barcelona, University of Barcelona, IDIBAPS"}}}
