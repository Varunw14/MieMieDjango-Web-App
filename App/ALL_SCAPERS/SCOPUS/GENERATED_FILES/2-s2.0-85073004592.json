Vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) is proposed as a personalized intervention both for ameliorating symptoms and for improving balance. The outcomes of the therapy are not the same in all patients and the reasons are explored in this study with data mining methods applied in two retrospective datasets. According to our findings, patients with unstable lesions, concurrent psychological problems and with headaches are poorer candidates for VRT. Patients with stable vestibular deficits, of recent onset and relatively intact psychological, acoustic, visual and proprioceptive systems are better candidates for VRT.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Data mining", "Vestibular rehabilitation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Associated costs", "Data mining methods", "Health-care system", "Vestibular reha-bilitation"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073004592", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Information Systems and Management", "DECI", "1802"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"36975570100": {"Name": "Gatsios D.", "AuthorID": "36975570100", "AffiliationID": "60004716", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Medical Technology and Intelligent Information Systems, University of Ioannina"}, "56252054300": {"Name": "Tsiouris K.M.", "AuthorID": "56252054300", "AffiliationID": "60004716", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Medical Technology and Intelligent Information Systems, University of Ioannina"}, "57192820400": {"Name": "Fotiadis D.I.", "AuthorID": "57192820400", "AffiliationID": "60004716", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Medical Technology and Intelligent Information Systems, University of Ioannina"}, "25521861600": {"Name": "Kikidis D.", "AuthorID": "25521861600", "AffiliationID": "60028900, 60069142", "AffiliationName": "Hippokrateio' General Hospital, National Kapodistrian University of Athens, First Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery"}, "6603409494": {"Name": "Bibas A.", "AuthorID": "6603409494", "AffiliationID": "60028900, 60069142", "AffiliationName": "Hippokrateio' General Hospital, National Kapodistrian University of Athens, First Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery"}, "55752436300": {"Name": "Nikitas C.", "AuthorID": "55752436300", "AffiliationID": "60028900, 60069142", "AffiliationName": "Hippokrateio' General Hospital, National Kapodistrian University of Athens, First Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery"}, "6701719104": {"Name": "Bamiou D.E.", "AuthorID": "6701719104", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148, 60010088", "AffiliationName": "London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre Hearing Deafness, UCL Ear Institute University College"}, "7006701361": {"Name": "Luxon L.", "AuthorID": "7006701361", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148, 60010088", "AffiliationName": "London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre Hearing Deafness, UCL Ear Institute University College"}, "7102380530": {"Name": "Maurer C.", "AuthorID": "7102380530", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "University of Freiburg, Department of Neurology"}, "7005676234": {"Name": "Wuyts F.L.", "AuthorID": "7005676234", "AffiliationID": "60012937", "AffiliationName": "Lab for Equilibrium Investigations and Aerospace, University of Antwerp"}, "57209212263": {"Name": "Celis L.", "AuthorID": "57209212263", "AffiliationID": "60012937", "AffiliationName": "Lab for Equilibrium Investigations and Aerospace, University of Antwerp"}, "16310276100": {"Name": "Maes L.", "AuthorID": "16310276100", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Ghent University"}, "8907555000": {"Name": "Exarchos T.", "AuthorID": "8907555000", "AffiliationID": "60013925", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, Ionian University"}}}
