Published by BMJ.Objectives Cognitive flexibility, which is key for adaptive decision-making, engages prefrontal cortex (PFC)-striatal circuitry and is impaired in both manifest and premanifest Huntington's disease (pre-HD). The aim of this study was to examine cognitive flexibility in a far from onset pre-HD cohort to determine whether an early impairment exists and if so, whether fronto-striatal circuits were associated with this deficit. Methods In the present study, we examined performance of 51 pre-HD participants (mean age=29.22 (SD=5.71) years) from the HD Young Adult Study cohort and 53 controls matched for age, sex and IQ, on the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) Intra-Extra Dimensional Set-Shift (IED) task. This cohort is unique as it is the furthest from disease onset comprehensively studied to date (mean years=23.89 (SD=5.96) years). The IED task measures visual discrimination learning, cognitive flexibility and specifically attentional set-shifting. We used resting-state functional MRI to examine whether the functional connectivity between specific fronto-striatal circuits was dysfunctional in pre-HD, compared with controls, and whether these circuits were associated with performance on the critical extradimensional shift stage. Results Our results demonstrated that the CANTAB IED task detects a mild early impairment in cognitive flexibility in a pre-HD group far from onset. Attentional set-shifting was significantly related to functional connectivity between the ventrolateral PFC and ventral striatum in healthy controls and to functional connectivity between the dorsolateral PFC and caudate in pre-HD participants. Conclusion We postulate that this incipient impairment of cognitive flexibility may be associated with intrinsically abnormal functional connectivity of fronto-striatal circuitry in pre-HD.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85099720519", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57216931615": {"Name": "Langley C.", "AuthorID": "57216931615", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge"}, "55318191500": {"Name": "O'Callaghan C.", "AuthorID": "55318191500", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Brain and Mind Centre, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney"}, "7007103224": {"Name": "Sahakian B.J.", "AuthorID": "7007103224", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge"}, "56785241700": {"Name": "Gregory S.", "AuthorID": "56785241700", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Huntington's Disease Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57221811169": {"Name": "Osborne-Crowley K.", "AuthorID": "57221811169", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "Division of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion, University of New South Wales"}, "55883095000": {"Name": "Zeun P.", "AuthorID": "55883095000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Huntington's Disease Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "36696650300": {"Name": "Lowe J.", "AuthorID": "36696650300", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Huntington's Disease Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57208140593": {"Name": "Johnson E.B.", "AuthorID": "57208140593", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Huntington's Disease Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57212047877": {"Name": "Papoutsi M.", "AuthorID": "57212047877", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Huntington's Disease Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "6602959028": {"Name": "Scahill R.I.", "AuthorID": "6602959028", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Huntington's Disease Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7006745684": {"Name": "Tabrizi S.J.", "AuthorID": "7006745684", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Huntington's Disease Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7202374409": {"Name": "Rees G.", "AuthorID": "7202374409", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, Ucl"}, "57211739712": {"Name": "Robbins T.W.", "AuthorID": "57211739712", "AffiliationID": "60032894, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Behavioural and Clinical Neuroscience Institute, University of Cambridge"}}}
