The transfer of this plasmid via the conjugative pilli of Escherichia coli was reduced by 76.5 \u00b1 2.0% and 79.0 \u00b1 1.2% by hexane extract and methanol fraction of M. lowiana, respectively. The hexane extract exhibited significant anti-conjugant activity at a non-cytotoxic concentration of 100 mg/L as assessed against adult human dermal fibroblast cells. The hexane extract and methanol fraction were screened using phytochemical tests, NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, and high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HRESIMS) and were found to contain terpenoids, sterols, and fatty acids.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087659578", "SubjectAreas": [["Complementary and Alternative Medicine", "MEDI", "2707"]], "AuthorData": {"36461123500": {"Name": "Kwapong A.A.", "AuthorID": "36461123500", "AffiliationID": "60017910", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics and Microbiology, School of Pharmacy, University of Ghana"}, "57217850213": {"Name": "Soares S.", "AuthorID": "57217850213", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016379", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Pharmaceutical and Biological Chemistry, Ucl School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57217847127": {"Name": "Teo S.P.", "AuthorID": "57217847127", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016379", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Pharmaceutical and Biological Chemistry, Ucl School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57189666030": {"Name": "Stapleton P.", "AuthorID": "57189666030", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016379", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Pharmaceutical and Biological Chemistry, Ucl School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "56232425600": {"Name": "Gibbons S.", "AuthorID": "56232425600", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University of East Anglia"}}}
