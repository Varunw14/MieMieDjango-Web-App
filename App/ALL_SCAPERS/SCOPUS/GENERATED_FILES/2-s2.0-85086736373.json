A bespoke optical fiber excitation Raman spectrometer with a 632.8 nm laser wavelength under an \u201coptical fiber excitation + spectrometer objective collection\u201d configuration was established and applied. The ongoing hydration of a clinker and a Portland cement (PC) was then monitored during their first 8 h of hydration. The main hydration products, in particular, C-S-H and ettringite & monosulfate (AFt & AFm), have been successfully identified and continuously monitored in situ. The findings from the optical fiber Raman were well supported by bench-mounted Raman, X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Isothermal Conduction Calorimetry (ICC) tests. The results presented in this paper show a great potential of optical fiber Raman spectroscopy for future civil engineering applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bench-mounted Raman spectroscopy", "Cement", "Clinker", "Hydration", "Optical fiber excitation Raman spectroscopy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Calcium silicate hydrate", "Civil engineering applications", "Hydration of cements", "Hydration products", "In- situ monitoring", "Isothermal conduction calorimetries", "Laser wavelength", "Raman spectrometers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086736373", "SubjectAreas": [["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"55758857700": {"Name": "Yue Y.", "AuthorID": "55758857700", "AffiliationID": "60023380", "AffiliationName": "College of Materials Science and Engineering, Chongqing University"}, "22952188800": {"Name": "Wang J.J.", "AuthorID": "22952188800", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "CRANN and AMBER Research Centres, Trinity College Dublin"}, "8612834400": {"Name": "Basheer P.A.M.", "AuthorID": "8612834400", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "55461062100": {"Name": "Bai Y.", "AuthorID": "55461062100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
