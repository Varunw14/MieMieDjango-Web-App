The main objective of the study is to quantify and model the effect of subconjunctival bleb on flow pressure for assessment of clinical grading following glaucoma surgery. Subconjunctival bleb was created by inserting a tube into ex vivo rabbit eyes via an ab externo approach through the anterior chamber and exiting into the subconjunctival space. Sterile dyed water was injected through the tube into the developing bleb. For the in vitro approach a silicone bleb was created by clamping a circular silicone sheet, injecting dyed water through a fixed resistance outlet tube. Photographic measurements of the bleb height, planform area and pressure were taken as a function of time. Clinical blebs were also collected over a few months. Mathematical algorithm software was used to build the bleb model. Bleb height and volume increase as pressure in the bleb increases. The bleb planform area tended to a constant determined by the section of conjunctiva prior to shunt insertion. These increases were in accordance with the bleb model developed in the Appendix. They show that the pressure in the bleb is related to the resistance of the outflow. The linearity of clinical grading systems is reviewed and a new grading approach is proposed. The pressure in the bleb has a strong dependence on bleb extent, height and a weak dependence on conjunctival thickness. The pressure in a bleb can be estimated from bleb height, radius, and flow rate inlet in agreement with the bleb flow model. These results provide support for an improved bleb categorization system.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Animals", "Blister", "Conjunctiva", "Disease Models, Animal", "Drainage", "Filtering Surgery", "Glaucoma", "Humans", "Intraocular Pressure", "Rabbits", "Wound Healing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074105343", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"15724255800": {"Name": "Bouremel Y.", "AuthorID": "15724255800", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "56878015600": {"Name": "Lee R.M.H.", "AuthorID": "56878015600", "AffiliationID": "60032993", "AffiliationName": "Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7006126106": {"Name": "Eames I.", "AuthorID": "7006126106", "AffiliationID": "60176024", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Mechanical Engineering"}, "6701323615": {"Name": "Brocchini S.", "AuthorID": "6701323615", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "7006578947": {"Name": "Khaw P.T.", "AuthorID": "7006578947", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
