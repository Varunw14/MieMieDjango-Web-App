Taking advantage of the clear optical media of the eye and ever-increasing resolution of modern imaging techniques, retinal morphology can now be visualized at a cellular level in vivo. This has provided a multitude of possible biomarkers and investigative surrogates that may be used to identify, monitor and study diseases until now limited to the brain. In many neurodegenerative conditions, early diagnosis is often very challenging due to the lack of tests with high sensitivity and specificity, but, once made, opens the door to patients accessing the correct treatment that can potentially improve functional outcomes. Using retinal biomarkers in vivo as an additional diagnostic tool may help overcome the need for invasive tests and histological specimens, and offers the opportunity to longitudinally monitor individuals over time. This review aims to summarise retinal biomarkers associated with a range of neurological conditions including Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and prion diseases from a clinical perspective. By comparing their similarities and differences according to primary pathological processes, we hope to show how retinal correlates can aid clinical decisions, and accelerate the study of this rapidly developing area of research.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "amyotrophic lateral sclerosis", "biomarker", "multiple sclerosis", "neurodegeneration", "optical coherence tomography", "parkinson\u2019s disease", "prion disease", "retina"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075935420", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"]], "AuthorData": {"57201720193": {"Name": "Yap T.E.", "AuthorID": "57201720193", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60016550", "AffiliationName": "The Western Eye Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust (ICHNT)"}, "56893716200": {"Name": "Balendra S.I.", "AuthorID": "56893716200", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Glaucoma and Retinal Neurodegeneration Group, Department of Visual Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57212106568": {"Name": "Almonte M.T.", "AuthorID": "57212106568", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "The Imperial College Ophthalmic Research Group (ICORG), Imperial College London"}, "57210287162": {"Name": "Cordeiro M.F.", "AuthorID": "57210287162", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60016550", "AffiliationName": "The Western Eye Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust (ICHNT)"}}}
