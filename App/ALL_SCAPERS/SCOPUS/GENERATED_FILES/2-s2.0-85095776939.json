Several forms of physical fitness could be modifiable risk factors for common mental disorders in the population. We examined associations between individual and combined markers of cardiorespiratory fitness and grip strength with the incidence of common mental disorders. Methods: A 7-year prospective cohort study in 152,978 UK Biobank participants. An exercise test and dynamometer were used to measure cardiorespiratory and grip strength, respectively. We used Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 scales to estimate the incidence of common mental disorders at follow-up. Results: Fully adjusted, longitudinal models indicated a dose-response relationship. Low and medium cardiorespiratory fitness was associated with 1.485 (95% CIs, 1.301 to 1.694, p < 0.001) and 1.141 (95% CIs, 1.005 to 1.297, p = 0.041) higher odds of depression or anxiety, compared to high cardiorespiratory fitness. Low and medium grip strength was associated with 1.381 (95% CIs, 1.315 to 1.452, p < 0.001) and 1.116 (95% CIs, 1.063 to 1.172, p < 0.001) higher odds of common mental disorder compared to high grip strength. Individuals in the lowest group for both cardiorespiratory fitness and grip strength had 1.981 (95% CIs, 1.553 to 2.527, p < 0.001) higher odds of depression, 1.599 (95% CIs, 1.148 to 2.118, p = 0.004) higher odds of anxiety, and 1.814 (95% CIs, 1.461 to 2.252, p < 0.001) higher odds of either common mental disorder, compared to high for both types of fitness. Conclusions: Objective cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness markers represent modifiable risk factors for common mental disorders. Public health strategies to reduce common mental disorders could include combinations of aerobic and resistance activities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anxiety", "Cardiorespiratory", "Depression", "Exercise", "Fitness", "Grip strength", "Muscular", "Physical activity", "Prevention"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095776939", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57202786616": {"Name": "Kandola A.A.", "AuthorID": "57202786616", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "57189923687": {"Name": "Osborn D.P.J.", "AuthorID": "57189923687", "AffiliationID": "60161451", "AffiliationName": "Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36518630100": {"Name": "Hayes J.F.", "AuthorID": "36518630100", "AffiliationID": "60161451", "AffiliationName": "Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57204891343": {"Name": "Stubbs B.", "AuthorID": "57204891343", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "Physiotherapy Department, South London, and Maudsley National Health Services Foundation Trust"}, "55924470700": {"Name": "Choi K.W.", "AuthorID": "55924470700", "AffiliationID": "60001001", "AffiliationName": "Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Broad Institute"}}}
