Unless gated Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance (MR) data are available, motion correction relies on registration of the PET data. To avoid mis-registration due to attenuation mismatches, most existing methods rely on pair-wise registration of Non-Attenuation Corrected (NAC) PET volumes. This is a challenging problem due to the low contrast and high noise of these volumes. This paper investigates the possibility of using motion models for respiratory motion correction in PET, and in particular whether incorporating Time-of-Flight (TOF) information increases the accuracy of the motion models derived from the NAC reconstructed images. 4D Extended Cardiac-Torso (XCAT) phantom simulations are used for one bed position with a field of view including the base of the lungs and the diaphragm. A TOF resolution of 375ps is used. NAC images are reconstructed using Orded SubSet Expectation Maximisation (OSEM) and used as input for motion model estimation. Different motion models are compared using the original XCAT input volumes. The results indicate that TOF improves the accuracy of the motion model considerably.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Expectation-maximisation", "Field of views", "Motion correction", "Motion modeling", "Positron emission tomography (PET)", "Reconstructed image", "Respiratory motions", "Time of flight"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083575836", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"]], "AuthorData": {"57216456850": {"Name": "Whitehead A.C.", "AuthorID": "57216456850", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Nuclear Medicine"}, "57205073110": {"Name": "Emond E.C.", "AuthorID": "57205073110", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Nuclear Medicine"}, "57205078505": {"Name": "Akintonde A.", "AuthorID": "57205078505", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Nuclear Medicine"}, "57217880435": {"Name": "Wollenweber S.W.", "AuthorID": "57217880435", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Nuclear Medicine"}, "57203050071": {"Name": "Hutton B.F.", "AuthorID": "57203050071", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Nuclear Medicine"}, "8757124700": {"Name": "McClelland J.R.", "AuthorID": "8757124700", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Nuclear Medicine"}, "15821657900": {"Name": "Efthimiou N.", "AuthorID": "15821657900", "AffiliationID": "60030469", "AffiliationName": "University of Hull, PET Research Centre, Faculty of Health Sciences"}, "7006642803": {"Name": "Stearns C.W.", "AuthorID": "7006642803", "AffiliationID": "124286690", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Imaging and Computed Tomography Engineering GE Healthcare"}, "23480655200": {"Name": "Thielemans K.", "AuthorID": "23480655200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Centre for Medical Image Computing"}}}
