A second tradition, however, has attributed the success of populist parties to particular \u201cthick\u201d or \u201chost\u201d ideologies, such as anti-immigration, anti-globalization, or pro-redistribution positions. This creates a need to unpack which exact components of thin and/or thick populist ideology attract voters to these parties. We address this question by leveraging conjoint survey experiments that allow us to causally identify the effects of several thin and thick populist attributes on vote choice. Examining the case of Germany, results from experiments embedded in two high-quality panel surveys demonstrate that populist anti-immigration and pro-redistribution positions as well as people-centric political priorities are the most vote-maximizing components of populist ideology. In contrast, anti-elite priorities as well as Eurosceptic and anti-globalization positions do not boost support, not even among voters with strong populist attitudes. Our findings also call into question conventional wisdom about the interplay between supply and demand in the electoral marketplace. Surprisingly, populist voters, in general, are not significantly more attracted to candidates who advocate populist priorities than non-populist voters.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Conjoint experiment", "Extremist parties", "Germany", "Populist attitudes", "Populist voting"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087511720", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"57130464900": {"Name": "Neuner F.G.", "AuthorID": "57130464900", "AffiliationID": "60003892", "AffiliationName": "School of Politics and Global Studies, Arizona State University"}, "56487997200": {"Name": "Wratil C.", "AuthorID": "56487997200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Political Science, University College London"}}}
