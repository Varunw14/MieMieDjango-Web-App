However, the mechanisms underlying these side effects, and why certain brain anatomies are more affected still remain poorly understood. Advanced functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methods, such as pharmaco-fMRI, can investigate medication-related effects on brain activities using task and resting state fMRI and showing reproducible activation and deactivation patterns. This methodological approach has been used successfully to complement neuropsychological studies of AEDs. Here we review pharmaco-fMRI studies in people with epilepsy targeting the most-widely prescribed AEDs. Pharmco-fMRI has advanced our understanding of the impact of AEDs on specific brain networks and thus may provide potential biomarkers to move beyond the current \u201ctrial and error\u201d approach when commencing anti-epileptic medication.", "AuthorKeywords": ["antiepileptic drugs", "drug response", "epilepsy", "functional MRI", "pharmaco-fMRI", "side-effects"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075984555", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57211327623": {"Name": "Xiao F.", "AuthorID": "57211327623", "AffiliationID": "60073509", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University"}, "57211825706": {"Name": "Zhou D.", "AuthorID": "57211825706", "AffiliationID": "60073509", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University"}, "7003606118": {"Name": "Koepp M.J.", "AuthorID": "7003606118", "AffiliationID": "60030943", "AffiliationName": "MRI Unit, Epilepsy Society"}}}
