Despite being one of the most popular depression scales, the psychometric properties, specifically the underlying factor structure of the scale, have come under scrutiny. The latent structure of a scale is a key indicator of its construct validity, i.e. the degree to which the intended variable is captured. To date, a comprehensive review of the latent structure of the CES-D in older adult populations (\u226565 years old) has not been conducted. We aimed to examine the latent structure of the CES-D in samples of older adults to assess its ability to capture depressive symptoms. Methods: A systematic review across Scopus, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases was conducted. Original studies conducting latent variable analysis of the 20-item CES-D in samples aged \u226565 years old were included. Results: Included studies (n = 6) were primarily conducted with community-dwelling older adults in the United States. Studies that conducted exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis (n = 2) revealed two latent factors, whereas those conducting confirmatory factor analysis of previously identified structures (n = 4) revealed four-factor structures in line with the original four-factor structure. Conclusions: A general alignment with the original four-factor structure of the CES-D provides tentative support for continued use amongst older adults; however, further research is required to provide conclusive evidence for these psychometric properties.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale", "Depression", "factor structure", "older adults"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084376568", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatric Mental Health", "NURS", "2921"], ["Gerontology", "NURS", "2909"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55948960700": {"Name": "Cosco T.D.", "AuthorID": "55948960700", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Institute of Population Ageing,, University of Oxford"}, "54881554100": {"Name": "Lachance C.C.", "AuthorID": "54881554100", "AffiliationID": "60085801", "AffiliationName": "Knowledge Translation Program, Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute of St. Michael\u2019s Hospital"}, "56333770000": {"Name": "Blodgett J.M.", "AuthorID": "56333770000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL"}, "57204891343": {"Name": "Stubbs B.", "AuthorID": "57204891343", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiotherapy, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57216559208": {"Name": "Co M.", "AuthorID": "57216559208", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Health Service and Population Health Department Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience"}, "55762239000": {"Name": "Wu Y.T.", "AuthorID": "55762239000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Health Service and Population Health Department Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience"}, "57207840403": {"Name": "Prina A.M.", "AuthorID": "57207840403", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Health Service and Population Health Department Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience"}, "36998781200": {"Name": "Veronese N.", "AuthorID": "36998781200", "AffiliationID": "113310873", "AffiliationName": "hNational Research Council, Neuroscience Institute, Aging Branch"}}}
