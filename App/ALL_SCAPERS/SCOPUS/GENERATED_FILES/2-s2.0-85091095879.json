An alternative method to obtain the all-in-focus image is to fuse several images that are focused at different depths. However, existing multi-focus image fusion methods cannot obtain clear results for areas near the focused/defocused boundary (FDB). In this article, a novel $\\alpha $ -matte boundary defocus model is proposed to generate realistic training data with the defocus spread effect precisely modeled, especially for areas near the FDB. Based on this $\\alpha $ -matte defocus model and the generated data, a cascaded boundary-aware convolutional network termed MMF-Net is proposed and trained, aiming to achieve clearer fusion results around the FDB. Specifically, the MMF-Net consists of two cascaded subnets for initial fusion and boundary fusion. These two subnets are designed to first obtain a guidance map of FDB and then refine the fusion near the FDB. Experiments demonstrate that with the help of the new $\\alpha $ -matte boundary defocus model, the proposed MMF-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CNNs", "defocus model", "Image fusion", "multi-focus"], "IndexKeywords": ["All-in-focus image", "Cascaded networks", "Convolutional networks", "Depth of field", "Model-based OPC", "Multifocus image fusion", "Single cameras", "State-of-the-art methods"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091095879", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"57212236460": {"Name": "Ma H.", "AuthorID": "57212236460", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School, Tsinghua University"}, "7102880275": {"Name": "Liao Q.", "AuthorID": "7102880275", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School, Tsinghua University"}, "57210587432": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "57210587432", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School, Tsinghua University"}, "57193215094": {"Name": "Liu S.", "AuthorID": "57193215094", "AffiliationID": "60008592", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"}, "7202881908": {"Name": "Xue J.H.", "AuthorID": "7202881908", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}}}
