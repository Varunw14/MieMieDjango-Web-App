Whilst mergers are not new for the English not-for-profit housing sector, a number of mega-mergers have materialised among the largest housing associations, with these newly formed organisations predicted to become amongst the largest volume housing builders in England and largest housing associations in Europe. Drawing on business literature, this paper examines the policy and business drivers, alongside managers\u2019 motivations and strategic choices that have culminated towards this mega-merger activity. These processes are highly significant for contemporary housing policy, with the dominance of large-scale organisations marking a complete reversal from a position where not-for-profit housing providers used to be valued as small-scale, locally based community organisations.
