Novel composites with antibacterial polylysine (PLS) (0, 4, 6, or 8 wt%) in its filler phase were therefore produced. Remineralising monocalcium phosphate was also included at double the PLS weight. Antibacterial studies involved set composite disc placement in 1% sucrose-supplemented broth containing Streptococcus mutans (UA159). Relative surface bacterial biofilm mass (n = 4) after 24 h was determined by crystal violet-binding. Live/dead bacteria and biofilm thickness (n = 3) were assessed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). To understand results and model possible in vivo benefits, cumulative PLS release from discs into water (n = 3) was determined by a ninhydrin assay. Results showed biofilm mass and thickness decreased linearly by 28% and 33%, respectively, upon increasing PLS from 0% to 8%. With 4, 6, and 8 wt% PLS, respectively, biofilm dead bacterial percentages and PLS release at 24 h were 20%, 60%, and 80% and 85, 163, and 241 \u03bcg/disc. Furthermore, initial PLS release was proportional to the square root of time and levelled after 1, 2, and 3 months at 13%, 28%, and 42%. This suggested diffusion controlled release from water-exposed composite surface layers of 65, 140, and 210 \u03bcm thickness, respectively. In conclusion, increasing PLS release initially in any gaps under the restoration to kill residual bacteria or longer-term following composite/tooth interface damage might help prevent recurrent caries.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antibacterial", "Antibiofilm", "Dental composite", "Polylysine"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092330182", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"57218544875": {"Name": "Yaghmoor R.B.", "AuthorID": "57218544875", "AffiliationID": "60006848", "AffiliationName": "Department of Restorative Dentistry, Umm Al-Qura University, College of Dental Medicine"}, "56051736700": {"Name": "Xia W.", "AuthorID": "56051736700", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "55506195900": {"Name": "Young A.M.", "AuthorID": "55506195900", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "7006826945": {"Name": "Ashley P.", "AuthorID": "7006826945", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Paediatric Dentistry, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "35848365800": {"Name": "Allan E.", "AuthorID": "35848365800", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbial Diseases, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}}}
