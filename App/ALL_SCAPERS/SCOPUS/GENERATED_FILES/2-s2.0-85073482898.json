One benefit of this recent upsurge in empirical work is the diversification of methods available for measuring iconicity. In this paper, we provide an overview of methods in the form of a 'toolbox'. We lay out empirical methods for measuring iconicity at a behavioural level, in the perception, production, and comprehension of iconic forms. We also discuss large-scale studies that look at iconicity on a system-wide level, based on objective measures of similarity between signals and meanings. We give a detailed overview of how different measures of iconicity can better address specific hypotheses, providing greater clarity when choosing testing methods.", "AuthorKeywords": ["iconicity", "methods", "systematicity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073482898", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"57205108135": {"Name": "Motamedi Y.", "AuthorID": "57205108135", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "57210743080": {"Name": "Nielsen A.", "AuthorID": "57210743080", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "57200280559": {"Name": "Sulik J.", "AuthorID": "57200280559", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "57191882201": {"Name": "Little H.", "AuthorID": "57191882201", "AffiliationID": "60019611", "AffiliationName": "University of the West of England"}}}
