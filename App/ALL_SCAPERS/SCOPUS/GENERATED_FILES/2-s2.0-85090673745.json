Methods: Thirty foveae from molecularly confirmed subjects with ACHM, half of whom harbored disease-causing variants in CNGA3 and half in CNGB3, underwent nonconfocal split-detection AOSLO imaging. Cone photoreceptors within the manually delineated rod-free zone were manually identified twice by two independent observers. The coordi-nates of the marked cones were used for quantifying foveal cone density. Cone density and difference maps were generated to compare cone topography between trials. Results: We observed excellent intraobserver repeatability in foveal cone density estimates, with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) ranging from 0.963 to 0.991 for CNGA3 and CNGB3 subjects. Interobserver reproducibility was also excellent for both CNGA3 (ICC = 0.952; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.903\u20131.0) and CNGB3 (ICC = 0.968; 95% CI, 0.935\u20131.0). However, Bland-Altman analysis revealed bias between observers. Conclusions: Foveal cone density can be measured using the described method with good repeatability and reproducibility both for CNGA3-andCNGB3-associated ACHM. Any degree of bias observed among the observers is of uncertain clinical significance but should be evaluated on a study-specific basis. Translational Relevance: This approach could be used to explore disease natural history, as well as to facilitate stratification of patients and monitor efficacy of interven-tions for ongoing and upcoming ACHM gene therapy trials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Achromatopsia", "Adaptive optics", "Cone photoreceptors", "Inherited retinal diseases", "Repeatability", "Reproducibility"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090673745", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"57200827164": {"Name": "Georgiou M.", "AuthorID": "57200827164", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57205562835": {"Name": "Singh N.", "AuthorID": "57205562835", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57205561522": {"Name": "Kane T.", "AuthorID": "57205561522", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57190489812": {"Name": "Patterson E.J.", "AuthorID": "57190489812", "AffiliationID": "60012553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences, Medical College of Wisconsin"}, "8863695000": {"Name": "Hirji N.", "AuthorID": "8863695000", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36490013200": {"Name": "Kalitzeos A.", "AuthorID": "36490013200", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57215380010": {"Name": "Michaelides M.", "AuthorID": "57215380010", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56503899900": {"Name": "Litts K.M.", "AuthorID": "56503899900", "AffiliationID": "60012553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences, Medical College of Wisconsin"}, "7402034918": {"Name": "Carroll J.", "AuthorID": "7402034918", "AffiliationID": "60012553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences, Medical College of Wisconsin"}, "35605657700": {"Name": "Dubra A.", "AuthorID": "35605657700", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Stanford University"}}}
