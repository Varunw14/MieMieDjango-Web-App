This article looks beyond this to consider how power operates in a distributed way through the relationships of the regulatory process. It develops a theoretical framing drawing on Foucauldian and Actor\u2013Network Theory perspectives that emphasises the securing of consent, performativity and the interrelation of knowledge and power. Using research into the regulation of major renewable energy infrastructure, it develops an analytics of power looking at silences, categorisation and black-boxing. This shows how power is operationalised through regulatory practice, so that local communities\u2019 concerns are only partially heard, differential attention is paid to project impacts and knowledge claims are selectively warranted as an evidence-base.", "AuthorKeywords": ["evidence", "infrastructure", "knowledge", "power", "regulation", "renewable energy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073835206", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"]], "AuthorData": {"6701374209": {"Name": "Rydin Y.", "AuthorID": "6701374209", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
