Many undergraduate healthcare professionals will not have experience of meeting or caring for someone who is dying. As death can occur in any setting, at any time, it is vital that all healthcare students, regardless of the setting they go on to work in, have end-of-life care (EOLC) training. The aim was to determine current palliative care training at the undergraduate level, in multiple professions, in recognising and communicating dying. Methods: Current UK undergraduate courses in medicine, adult nursing, occupational therapy, social work and physiotherapy were included. All courses received an email asking what training is currently offered in the recognition and communication of dying, and what time was dedicated to this. Results: A total of 73/198 (37%) courses responded to the request for information. 18/20 medical courses provided training in recognising when patients were dying (median 2 hours), and 17/20 provided training in the communication of dying (median 3 hours). 80% (43/54) of nursing and allied health professional courses provided some training in EOLC. Many of the course organisers expressed frustration at the lack of resources, funding and time to include more training. Those courses with more palliative care provision often had a \u00e2 \u20ac champion' to advocate for it. Conclusions: Training in EOLC was inconsistent across courses and professions. Further research is needed to understand how to remove the barriers identified and to improve the consistency of current training.", "AuthorKeywords": ["death", "education", "palliative care"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075676526", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Oncology (nursing)", "NURS", "2917"], ["Medical and Surgical Nursing", "NURS", "2914"]], "AuthorData": {"57209123506": {"Name": "White N.", "AuthorID": "57209123506", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Department, University College London"}, "6506333288": {"Name": "Oostendorp L.J.M.", "AuthorID": "6506333288", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Department, University College London"}, "6506760042": {"Name": "Yardley S.", "AuthorID": "6506760042", "AffiliationID": "60162114", "AffiliationName": "Palliative Medicine, Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55837129400": {"Name": "Stone P.", "AuthorID": "55837129400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Department, University College London"}, "24766479300": {"Name": "Minton O.", "AuthorID": "24766479300", "AffiliationID": "60003456", "AffiliationName": "Palliative Medicine, Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust"}}}
