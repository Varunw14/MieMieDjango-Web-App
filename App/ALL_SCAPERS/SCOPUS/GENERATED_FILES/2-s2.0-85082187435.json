To bring coherence to the expansive set of findings from small-sample studies, the field early on adopted meta-analysis. Nevertheless, gaps in understanding intergenerational transmission of individual differences in attachment continue to exist. We discuss how attachment research has been addressing these challenges by collaborating in formulating questions and pooling data and resources for individual-participant-data meta-analyses. The collaborative model means that sharing hard-won and valuable data goes hand in hand with directly and intensively interacting with a large community of researchers in the initiation phase of research, deliberating on and critically reviewing new hypotheses, and providing access to a large, carefully curated pool of data for testing these hypotheses. Challenges in pooling data are also discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["attachment", "individual-participant data", "meta-analysis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082187435", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"54791593900": {"Name": "Verhage M.L.", "AuthorID": "54791593900", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60117142", "AffiliationName": "Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam"}, "6602281287": {"Name": "Schuengel C.", "AuthorID": "6602281287", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60117142", "AffiliationName": "Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam"}, "57215876506": {"Name": "Bakermans\u2013Kranenburg M.J.", "AuthorID": "57215876506", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60117142", "AffiliationName": "Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam"}, "15757886400": {"Name": "Oosterman M.", "AuthorID": "15757886400", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60117142", "AffiliationName": "Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam"}, "36986651700": {"Name": "Duschinsky R.", "AuthorID": "36986651700", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge"}, "7005398271": {"Name": "van IJzendoorn M.H.", "AuthorID": "7005398271", "AffiliationID": "60022265", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Education, and Child Studies, Erasmus University Rotterdam"}, "57192924582": {"Name": "Fearon R.M.P.", "AuthorID": "57192924582", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "7004362362": {"Name": "Madigan S.", "AuthorID": "7004362362", "AffiliationID": "60192961", "AffiliationName": "Alberta Children\u2019s Hospital Research Institute"}, "6602728149": {"Name": "Roisman G.I.", "AuthorID": "6602728149", "AffiliationID": "120708070", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
