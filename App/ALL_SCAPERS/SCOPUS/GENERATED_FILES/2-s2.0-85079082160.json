Design: A panel of 49 international experts, representing 12 international organizations, as well as three methodologists and three public members was convened. Panel members assembled at key international meetings (for those panel members attending the conference), and a stand-alone meeting was held for all panel members in November 2018. A formal conflict-of-interest policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among the chairs, co-chairs, methodologists, and group heads, as well as within subgroups, served as an integral part of the guideline development process. Methods: The panel consisted of six subgroups: recognition and management of infection, hemodynamics and resuscitation, ventilation, endocrine and metabolic therapies, adjunctive therapies, and research priorities. We conducted a systematic review for each Population, Intervention, Control, and Outcomes question to identify the best available evidence, statistically summarized the evidence, and then assessed the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. We used the evidence-to-decision framework to formulate recommendations as strong or weak, or as a best practice statement. In addition, \u201cin our practice\u201d statements were included when evidence was inconclusive to issue a recommendation, but the panel felt that some guidance based on practice patterns may be appropriate. Results: The panel provided 77 statements on the management and resuscitation of children with septic shock and other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction. Overall, six were strong recommendations, 49 were weak recommendations, and nine were best-practice statements. For 13 questions, no recommendations could be made; but, for 10 of these, \u201cin our practice\u201d statements were provided. In addition, 52 research priorities were identified. Conclusions: A large cohort of international experts was able to achieve consensus regarding many recommendations for the best care of children with sepsis, acknowledging that most aspects of care had relatively low quality of evidence resulting in the frequent issuance of weak recommendations. Despite this challenge, these recommendations regarding the management of children with septic shock and other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction provide a foundation for consistent care to improve outcomes and inform future research.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Evidence-based medicine", "Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria", "Guidelines", "Infection", "Pediatrics", "Sepsis", "Septic shock", "Surviving Sepsis Campaign"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Consensus", "Critical Care", "Guidelines as Topic", "Humans", "Infant", "Organ Dysfunction Scores", "Pediatrics", "Sepsis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85079082160", "SubjectAreas": [["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"]], "AuthorData": {"57213110691": {"Name": "Weiss S.L.", "AuthorID": "57213110691", "AffiliationID": "60003711, 60030118", "AffiliationName": "Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine"}, "15832490200": {"Name": "Nishisaki A.", "AuthorID": "15832490200", "AffiliationID": "60003711, 60030118", "AffiliationName": "Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine"}, "9247239800": {"Name": "Verger J.T.", "AuthorID": "9247239800", "AffiliationID": "60024324", "AffiliationName": "College of Nursing, University of Iowa"}, "7402415882": {"Name": "Peters M.J.", "AuthorID": "7402415882", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "9534200900": {"Name": "Brierley J.", "AuthorID": "9534200900", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "55090169700": {"Name": "Alhazzani W.", "AuthorID": "55090169700", "AffiliationID": "60031828", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Research Methods and Impact, McMaster University"}, "7004666002": {"Name": "Choong K.", "AuthorID": "7004666002", "AffiliationID": "60031828", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Research Methods and Impact, McMaster University"}, "6603740415": {"Name": "Agus M.S.D.", "AuthorID": "6603740415", "AffiliationID": "60030521, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Boston Children\u2019s Hospital and Harvard Medical School"}, "7102106496": {"Name": "Tasker R.C.", "AuthorID": "7102106496", "AffiliationID": "60030521, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Boston Children\u2019s Hospital and Harvard Medical School"}, "6506271976": {"Name": "Flori H.R.", "AuthorID": "6506271976", "AffiliationID": "60008966", "AffiliationName": "C.S.
