Fault offsets have been dated using a combination of 234U/230Th coral dates and in situ 36Cl cosmogenic exposure ages for sediments and wave-cut platforms deformed by the faults. Our results show that deformation in the tip zone is distributed across as many as eight faults arranged within ~700 m across strike, each of which deforms deposits and landforms associated with the 125 ka marine terrace of Marine Isotope Stage 5e. Summed throw-rates across strike achieve values as high as 0.3\u20131.6 mm/yr, values that are comparable to those at the centre of the crustal-scale fault (2\u20133 mm/yr from Holocene palaeoseismology and 3\u20134 mm/yr from GPS geodesy). The relatively high deformation rate and distributed deformation in the tip zone are discussed in terms of stress enhancement from rupture of neighbouring crustal-scale faults and in terms of how this should be considered during fault-based seismic hazard assessment.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cosmogenic exposure", "Deformation rates", "Distributed deformation", "Gulf of Corinth , Greece", "Marine isotope stages", "Palaeoseismology", "Seismic hazard assessment", "Stress enhancement"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084941581", "SubjectAreas": [["Geology", "EART", "1907"]], "AuthorData": {"57199327845": {"Name": "Robertson J.", "AuthorID": "57199327845", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "7403399232": {"Name": "Roberts G.P.", "AuthorID": "7403399232", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "56419852600": {"Name": "Iezzi F.", "AuthorID": "56419852600", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "55851125700": {"Name": "Meschis M.", "AuthorID": "55851125700", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "55184146900": {"Name": "Gheorghiu D.M.", "AuthorID": "55184146900", "AffiliationID": "60017641", "AffiliationName": "Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre"}, "35790583000": {"Name": "Sahy D.", "AuthorID": "35790583000", "AffiliationID": "60022706", "AffiliationName": "British Geological Survey"}, "7005846622": {"Name": "Bristow C.", "AuthorID": "7005846622", "AffiliationID": "121489964", "AffiliationName": "Arcadis Consulting Ltd"}, "57211959472": {"Name": "Sgambato C.", "AuthorID": "57211959472", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, University College London"}}}
