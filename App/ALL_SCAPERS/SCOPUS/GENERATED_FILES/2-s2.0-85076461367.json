All rights reserved.Background: support garments are commonly worn by people with a urostomy but there are no published data about their experiences of doing so. Aims: to identify the views of people living with a urostomy on the role of support garments. Methods: a cross-sectional survey of the stoma population's experiences of support garments was conducted in 2018. Recruitment was by social media. The free-text responses provided by a sub-sample of 58 people out of 103 respondents with a urostomy, were analysed. Findings: thematic analysis revealed four themes: physical self-management; psychosocial self-management; lifestyle; and healthcare advice and support. There were mixed feelings about the value of support garments. Many cited a sense of reassurance and confidence and being able to be more sociable and active; others reported discomfort and uncertainty about their value. Conclusion: these findings add new understanding of experiences of support garments and provide novel theoretical insights about life with a urostomy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Patient experience", "Stoma care", "Support garments", "Urostomy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Clothing", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Ostomy", "Qualitative Research", "Urinary Diversion", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076461367", "SubjectAreas": [["Nursing (all)", "NURS", "2900"]], "AuthorData": {"57192268622": {"Name": "Taylor C.", "AuthorID": "57192268622", "AffiliationID": "60105470", "AffiliationName": "London North West Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "55962806800": {"Name": "Munro J.", "AuthorID": "55962806800", "AffiliationID": "60105228", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nursing and Midwifery, Centre for Health Science, University of the Highlands and Islands"}, "15076862900": {"Name": "Hubbard G.", "AuthorID": "15076862900", "AffiliationID": "60105228", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nursing and Midwifery, Centre for Health Science, University of the Highlands and Islands"}, "57204050004": {"Name": "Goodman W.", "AuthorID": "57204050004", "AffiliationID": "60023959, 60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Health Sciences, University of Leeds"}, "36196242700": {"Name": "Beeken R.J.", "AuthorID": "36196242700", "AffiliationID": "60023959, 60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Health Sciences, University of Leeds"}, "57208837726": {"Name": "Dames N.", "AuthorID": "57208837726", "AffiliationID": "122557862", "AffiliationName": "Vanilla Blush"}, "34572633400": {"Name": "Oliphant R.", "AuthorID": "34572633400", "AffiliationID": "60004450, 60000866", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Raigmore Hospital, NHS Highland"}, "7403383307": {"Name": "Watson A.J.M.", "AuthorID": "7403383307", "AffiliationID": "60004450, 60000866", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Raigmore Hospital, NHS Highland"}}}
