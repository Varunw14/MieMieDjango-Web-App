Lower SES groups may hold both fewer positive and more negative cancer beliefs that discourage these behaviors. We examined SES differences in positive and negative cancer beliefs in US adults. Methods: We conducted telephone interviews with a population-representative sample, aged 50+, using the Awareness and Beliefs about Cancer instrument (N = 1425). Cancer beliefs were measured using three positively and three negatively framed items. We used multivariable logistic regression models to examine associations between beliefs and education, which served as a marker of individual-level SES. Results: Agreement with positive statements was high (>80%) and did not vary with education, while agreement with negative statements varied. Relative to adults with a bachelor's degree, adults with a high school degree or less were more likely to agree that \u201ctreatment is worse than cancer\u201d (45.2% vs. 68.2%; adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2.43, 99% CI = 1.50\u20133.94), cancer is \u201ca death sentence\u201d (17.4% vs. 33.2%; aOR = 2.51, 99% CI = 1.45\u20134.37), and they \u201cwould not want to know if I have cancer\u201d (15.7% vs. 31.6%; aOR = 2.88, 99% CI = 1.54\u20135.36). Conclusions: Positive cancer statements were generally endorsed, but negative statements were more frequently endorsed by lower SES groups. Additional work is needed to understand how negative beliefs develop and coexist alongside positive beliefs. Interventions to improve detection behaviors targeting lower SES groups may benefit from focusing on reducing negative beliefs, rather than increasing positive beliefs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["attitude", "belief", "cancer", "education", "oncology", "psycho-oncology", "social class"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85093984613", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55341391800": {"Name": "Sarma E.A.", "AuthorID": "55341391800", "AffiliationID": "60013409", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Prevention Fellowship Program, Division of Cancer Prevention, National Cancer Institute"}, "7004666455": {"Name": "Kobrin S.C.", "AuthorID": "7004666455", "AffiliationID": "60013409", "AffiliationName": "Healthcare Delivery Research Program, Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, National Cancer Institute"}, "55908894400": {"Name": "Quaife S.L.", "AuthorID": "55908894400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioral Science and Health, University College London"}, "55255735100": {"Name": "Rendle K.A.", "AuthorID": "55255735100", "AffiliationID": "60003711, 60006297", "AffiliationName": "Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania"}}}
