However, its expansion into nonlinear regimes has remained elusive due to the inherent linear properties of the Green-function approach. This work presents a novel frequency-domain Green function method to describe and model nonlinear wave interactions in isotropic hyperelastic media. As an example of the capabilities of the method, we detail the generation of sum frequency waves when initial quasi-monochromatic waves are emitted in a fluid by finite sources. The method is supported by both numerical and experimental results using immersion ultrasonic techniques.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Green functions", "nonlinear ultrasonics", "wave mixing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Function decomposition", "Linear wave propagation", "Non-linear ultrasonics", "Non-linear wave interactions", "Nonlinear interactions", "Quasi-monochromatic", "Ultrasonic techniques", "Wave mixing"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077592032", "SubjectAreas": [["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"]], "AuthorData": {"8264333100": {"Name": "Demcenko A.", "AuthorID": "8264333100", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "University of Glasgow, Division of Biomedical Engineering"}, "25825387900": {"Name": "Reboud J.", "AuthorID": "25825387900", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "University of Glasgow, Division of Biomedical Engineering"}, "55154841200": {"Name": "Cooper J.M.", "AuthorID": "55154841200", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "University of Glasgow, Division of Biomedical Engineering"}, "7004037324": {"Name": "Mazilu M.", "AuthorID": "7004037324", "AffiliationID": "60022132", "AffiliationName": "University of St. Andrews, SUPA, School of Physics and Astronomy"}}}
