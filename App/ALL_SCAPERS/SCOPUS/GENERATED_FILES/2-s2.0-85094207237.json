Methods Current and former smokers (n=787, aged 60-75) within a real-world screening demonstration pilot completed measures of lung cancer worry at three time points (T 0: appointment, T 1: next day, T 2: 3 months) and anxiety and depression at two time points (T 0 and T 2). A 'screening unaware' community sample (n=383) with the same age and smoking characteristics completed these measures once (T 0). Mean scores were compared by sample type and LDCT result. Results Compared with the community sample (T 0), mean scores were higher in the screening sample, and statistically significantly increased in adjusted analyses, for lung cancer worry at T 0 and T 2 (mean (M): 9.32; 95% CI 8.96 to 9.69 vs M: 11.34; 11.09 to 11.59 and M: 11.88; 11.49 to 12.27), for anxiety at T 0 and T 2 (M: 3.32; 2.94 to 3.70 vs M: 4.73; 4.42 to 5.04 and M: 5.78; 5.33 to 6.23) and depression at T 2 (M: 3.85; 3.44 to 4.27 vs M: 4.15; 3.76 to 4.55). Scores were highest for those with indeterminate (eg, T 2 anxiety M: 6.93; 5.65 to 8.21) and incidental findings (primary care follow-up M: 5.34; 4.67 to 6.02) and those ineligible for screening (M: 6.51; 5.25 to 7.77). Being female, younger, not in paid employment, not married/cohabiting with a partner and lower education predicted poorer psychological outcomes at T 0, but not T 2 after adjusting for baseline scores. Mean scores remained within 'normal' clinical ranges. Conclusion Psychological distress was raised among high-risk individuals undergoing LDCT screening in a real-world setting, but overall differences were unlikely to be clinically meaningful. It will be critical to monitor the psychological impact of services longitudinally across diverse settings, including subgroups vulnerable to clinically elevated distress.
