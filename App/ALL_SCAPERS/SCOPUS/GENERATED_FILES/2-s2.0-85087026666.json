Hydrological models vary in their spatial distribution and process representations of unsaturated and saturated zones. Very good performance is achieved for 1975\u20131999 (NSE: 0.65\u20130.8; r: 0.79\u20130.93). GCM-related uncertainty dominates variability in projections of high and mean discharges (mean: \u201334% to +55% for RCP4.5,\u20132% to +195% for RCP8.5). Although GCMs dominate uncertainty in projected low flows, inter-hydrological model uncertainty is considerable (RCP4.5: \u201360% to +228%, RCP8.5: \u201386% to +337%). Analysis of variance uncertainty attribution reveals that GCM-related uncertainty occupies, on average, 68% of total uncertainty for median and high flows and hydrological models no more than 1%. For low flows, hydrological model uncertainty occupies, on average, 18% of total uncertainty; GCM-related uncertainty remains substantial (average: 28%).", "AuthorKeywords": ["climate change", "hydrological modelling", "uncertainty", "Upper Awash Basin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Climate change impact", "General circulation model", "Hydrological modeling", "Hydrological models", "Process representation", "River discharge", "Total uncertainties", "Uncertainty assessment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087026666", "SubjectAreas": [["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"]], "AuthorData": {"57217291683": {"Name": "Chan W.C.H.", "AuthorID": "57217291683", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}, "55551610200": {"Name": "Thompson J.R.", "AuthorID": "55551610200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}, "8106351700": {"Name": "Taylor R.G.", "AuthorID": "8106351700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}, "57217288146": {"Name": "Nay A.E.", "AuthorID": "57217288146", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}, "6506587234": {"Name": "Ayenew T.", "AuthorID": "6506587234", "AffiliationID": "60071181", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth Sciences, University of Addis Ababa"}, "7401581383": {"Name": "MacDonald A.M.", "AuthorID": "7401581383", "AffiliationID": "60171663, 60022706", "AffiliationName": "British Geological Survey, Lyell Centre, Research Avenue South"}, "7202803069": {"Name": "Todd M.C.", "AuthorID": "7202803069", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University of Sussex"}}}
