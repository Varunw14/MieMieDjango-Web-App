Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdThe assignment of an HLA allele name to a sequence requires a comparison between the generated target sequence and a reference sequence on the IPD-IMGT/HLA database. Absence of a full-length reference sequence can result in the inability of HLA typing software to accurately compare and assign the sequence. We sequenced the most frequently seen HLA class I alleles on the Anthony Nolan register present in the database with only a partial genomic sequence, with the aim of increasing the number of complete reference sequences. We successfully extended 95 full-length HLA class I sequences and identified 13 novel variants. Increasing the number of full-length HLA class I reference sequences in the database has aided accuracy of HLA analysis tools for all histocompatibility and immunogenetics laboratories.", "AuthorKeywords": ["full-length sequences", "HLA class I"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85078779410", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"57214444091": {"Name": "Hassall K.B.", "AuthorID": "57214444091", "AffiliationID": "60020641", "AffiliationName": "Anthony Nolan Research Institute"}, "7005765002": {"Name": "Latham K.", "AuthorID": "7005765002", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, Royal Free Campus"}, "57198433717": {"Name": "Robinson J.", "AuthorID": "57198433717", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, Royal Free Campus"}, "57202363510": {"Name": "Gymer A.", "AuthorID": "57202363510", "AffiliationID": "60020641", "AffiliationName": "Anthony Nolan Research Institute"}, "57214457266": {"Name": "Goodall R.", "AuthorID": "57214457266", "AffiliationID": "60020641", "AffiliationName": "Anthony Nolan Research Institute"}, "57214473665": {"Name": "Merlo D.", "AuthorID": "57214473665", "AffiliationID": "60020641", "AffiliationName": "Anthony Nolan Research Institute"}, "55942654100": {"Name": "Marsh S.G.E.", "AuthorID": "55942654100", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, Royal Free Campus"}, "6603144775": {"Name": "Mayor N.P.", "AuthorID": "6603144775", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, Royal Free Campus"}}}
