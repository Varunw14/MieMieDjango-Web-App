The protein sequence of XynA was found to be similar to those of other Thermomyces lanuginosus derived xylanases and, as a result, could be used as a model enzyme for understanding the protein structure\u2013activity relationship and facilitating protein engineering to design enzyme variants with desirable properties. Therefore, this xylanase will be an attractive candidate for applications in the biofuel and fine chemical industries for the degradation of xylans in steam pre-treated biomass.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Endo-1,4-\u03b2-xylanase", "Protein sequence", "Thermomyces lanuginosus", "Tryptic mapping", "Xylanase structure"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084482269", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"]], "AuthorData": {"57216742928": {"Name": "Mathibe B.N.", "AuthorID": "57216742928", "AffiliationID": "60026548", "AffiliationName": "Enzyme Science Programme (ESP), Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, Rhodes University"}, "56480694900": {"Name": "Malgas S.", "AuthorID": "56480694900", "AffiliationID": "60026548", "AffiliationName": "Enzyme Science Programme (ESP), Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, Rhodes University"}, "57216756804": {"Name": "Radosavljevic L.", "AuthorID": "57216756804", "AffiliationID": "60026548", "AffiliationName": "Enzyme Science Programme (ESP), Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, Rhodes University"}, "15745818500": {"Name": "Pletschke B.I.", "AuthorID": "15745818500", "AffiliationID": "60026548", "AffiliationName": "Enzyme Science Programme (ESP), Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, Rhodes University"}, "57202530521": {"Name": "Kumar V.", "AuthorID": "57202530521", "AffiliationID": "60004880", "AffiliationName": "Enzyme Technology and Protein Bioinformatics Laboratory, Department of Microbiology, Maharshi Dayanand University"}, "7202961636": {"Name": "Shukla P.", "AuthorID": "7202961636", "AffiliationID": "60004880", "AffiliationName": "Enzyme Technology and Protein Bioinformatics Laboratory, Department of Microbiology, Maharshi Dayanand University"}}}
