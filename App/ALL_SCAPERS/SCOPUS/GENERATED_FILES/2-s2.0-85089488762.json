To date, only two treatments, remdesivir and dexamethasone, have demonstrated clinical efficacy through randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in seriously ill patients. The search for new or repurposed drugs for treatment of COVID-19 continues. We have witnessed anecdotal use of herbal medicines, including Artemisia spp. extracts, in low-income countries, and exaggerated claims of their efficacies that are not evidence based, with subsequent political controversy. These events highlight the urgent need for further research on herbal compounds to evaluate efficacy through RCTs, and, when efficacious compounds are identified, to establish the active ingredients, develop formulations and dosing, and define pharmacokinetics, toxicology, and safety to enable drug development. Derivatives from the herb Artemisia annua have been used as traditional medicine over centuries for the treatment of fevers, malaria, and respiratory tract infections. We review the bioactive compounds, pharmacological and immunological effects, and traditional uses for Artemisia spp. derivatives, and discuss the challenges and controversies surrounding current efforts and the scientific road map to advance them to prevent or treat COVID-19.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Artemisia", "Betacoronavirus", "Coronavirus Infections", "Humans", "Pandemics", "Plant Extracts", "Pneumonia, Viral", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089488762", "SubjectAreas": [["Parasitology", "IMMU", "2405"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57189898523": {"Name": "Kapepula P.M.", "AuthorID": "57189898523", "AffiliationID": "60072820", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Centre d\u2019Etudes des Substances Naturelles d\u2019Origine V\u00e9g\u00e9tale (CESNOV), University of Kinshasa"}, "57218865307": {"Name": "Kabengele J.K.", "AuthorID": "57218865307", "AffiliationID": "60072820", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Centre d\u2019Etudes des Substances Naturelles d\u2019Origine V\u00e9g\u00e9tale (CESNOV), University of Kinshasa"}, "57218865323": {"Name": "Kingombe M.", "AuthorID": "57218865323", "AffiliationID": "105845158", "AffiliationName": "National Program for the Promotion of Traditional Medicine and Medicinal Plants (PNMT-PM), Ministry of PublicHealth"}, "57202420703": {"Name": "van Bambeke F.", "AuthorID": "57202420703", "AffiliationID": "60000874", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacologie Cellulaire et Mol\u00e9culaire, Louvain Drug Research Institute, Universit\u00e9Catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain)"}, "24497463300": {"Name": "Tulkens P.M.", "AuthorID": "24497463300", "AffiliationID": "60000874", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacologie Cellulaire et Mol\u00e9culaire, Louvain Drug Research Institute, Universit\u00e9Catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain)"}, "55917034400": {"Name": "Kishabongo A.S.", "AuthorID": "55917034400", "AffiliationID": "60139069", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Biology, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Bukavu (UCB)"}, "31967539400": {"Name": "Decloedt E.", "AuthorID": "31967539400", "AffiliationID": "60001565", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Stellenbosch University"}, "57218866037": {"Name": "Zumla A.", "AuthorID": "57218866037", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57218613585": {"Name": "Tiberi S.", "AuthorID": "57218613585", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "56986030500": {"Name": "Suleman F.", "AuthorID": "56986030500", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of KwaZulu Natal"}, "56434593900": {"Name": "Tshilolo L.", "AuthorID": "56434593900", "AffiliationID": "125092796", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Official University of Mbuji-Mayi (UOM)"}, "6603743560": {"Name": "Muyembe-TamFum J.J.", "AuthorID": "6603743560", "AffiliationID": "60072820", "AffiliationName": "Department ofMedical Microbiology and Virology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Kinshasa"}, "57216109256": {"Name": "Zumla A.", "AuthorID": "57216109256", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "NationalInstitute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, University College London, Hospitals"}, "6701544088": {"Name": "Nachega J.B.", "AuthorID": "6701544088", "AffiliationID": "60003742", "AffiliationName": "Center for Global Health, University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health"}}}
