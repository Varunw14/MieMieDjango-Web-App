Following audit 1 (A1), a number of preventable themes emerged on the basis of which recommendations were made to improve quality and co-ordination of care and a network approach was developed to improve awareness and education amongst patients and non-expert professionals. Audit 2 (A2) was undertaken to determine the effect of these measures. The central NHS IT database identified emergency NMD admissions. Case notes were reviewed and audited against pre-agreed criteria. A1 included 576 admissions (395 patients) A2 included 361 admissions (314 patients). Preventable admissions (where an NMD was known) accounted for 63% in A1 and 33% in A2, with more patients followed up at a specialised neuromuscular centre in A2. There were fewer re-admissions in A2 (12%) compared with A1 (25%) and lower mortality (A1: 4.5%, A2: 0.3%). A2 showed a significant rise in patients admitted under the care of neuroscience during the acute admission and fewer preventable ITU admissions. These audits demonstrate a significant impact for both patient care and potential for financial savings following the implementation of recommendations made after A1.", "AuthorKeywords": ["A&E", "Emergency admissions", "Neuromuscular diseases", "NHS", "Public Health"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Emergency Medical Services", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Medical Audit", "Middle Aged", "National Health Programs", "Neuromuscular Diseases", "Patient Admission", "Patient Education as Topic", "Process Assessment, Health Care", "Public Health", "Quality Improvement", "Retrospective Studies", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85080025146", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"55343433000": {"Name": "Scalco R.S.", "AuthorID": "55343433000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57208851936": {"Name": "Quinlivan R.M.", "AuthorID": "57208851936", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7801520840": {"Name": "Nastasi L.", "AuthorID": "7801520840", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "56872646000": {"Name": "Jaffer F.", "AuthorID": "56872646000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "15075798500": {"Name": "Hanna M.G.", "AuthorID": "15075798500", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
