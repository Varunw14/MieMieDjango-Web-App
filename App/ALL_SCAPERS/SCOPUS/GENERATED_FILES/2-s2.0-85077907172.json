This paper presents extensions to the Jansen and Rit neural mass model (JRNMM) to replicate paroxysmal transitions in intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) recordings. First, the Duffing NMM (DNMM) is introduced to emulate stochastic generators of seizures. The DNMM is constructed by applying perturbations to linear models of synaptic transmission in each neural population of the JRNMM. Then, the slow-fast DNMM is introduced by considering slow dynamics (relative to membrane potential and firing rate) of some internal parameters of the DNMM to replicate pathological evolution of ion currents. Through simulation, it is illustrated that the slow-fast DNMM exhibits transitions to and from seizures with etiologies that are linked either to random input fluctuations or pathological evolution of slow states. Estimation and optimization of a log likelihood function (LLF) using a continuous-discrete unscented Kalman filter (CD-UKF) and a genetic algorithm (GA) are performed to capture dynamics of iEEG data with paroxysmal transitions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Continuous-discrete unscented kalman filters", "Estimation and optimization", "Internal parameters", "Log-likelihood functions", "Membrane potentials", "Neural mass models", "Regulatory dynamics", "Synaptic transmission", "Electroencephalography", "Epilepsy", "Humans", "Models, Neurological", "Neurons", "Seizures"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077907172", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"57209365153": {"Name": "Jafarian A.", "AuthorID": "57209365153", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Center for Human Neuroimaging, University Collage London"}, "35408997900": {"Name": "Freestone D.R.", "AuthorID": "35408997900", "AffiliationID": "120315616", "AffiliationName": "Seer Medical"}, "6507031713": {"Name": "Grayden D.B.", "AuthorID": "6507031713", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Dept.
