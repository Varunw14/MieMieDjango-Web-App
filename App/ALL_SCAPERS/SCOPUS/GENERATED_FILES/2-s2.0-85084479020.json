Efforts to explain this puzzle have focused on constraints at the domestic level, but have not engaged with the cultural sources of bargaining style highlighted by constructivist scholars. Drawing on a series of interviews, this article suggests a number of cultural factors have influenced the UK's decision to adopt a hard bargaining strategy, including the country's majoritarian institutional culture, its weak socialization into the EU, overstated perceptions of its own capabilities, the prevailing conservative political ideology, and a longstanding preference for \u2018divide and rule\u2019 diplomatic strategies. Our findings suggest not only that the UK's choice of negotiating strategy is sub-optimal but also that theories of bargaining need to pay attention to cultural factors predisposing actors to particular strategies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bargaining theory", "Brexit", "constructivism", "ideology", "negotiations", "United Kingdom"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084479020", "SubjectAreas": [["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"57194681324": {"Name": "Martill B.", "AuthorID": "57194681324", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Politics and International Relations, School of Social and Political Science, University of Edinburgh"}, "32668066900": {"Name": "Staiger U.", "AuthorID": "32668066900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL European Institute, University College London"}}}
