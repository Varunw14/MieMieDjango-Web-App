The Indian population is underrepresented or its information with respect to clinically relevant variants is sparse in public data sets. The aim of this study was to estimate the burden of monogenic disease-causing variants in Indian populations. Toward this, we have assessed the frequency profile of monogenic phenotype-associated ClinVar variants. The study utilized a genotype data set (global screening array, Illumina) from 2795 individuals (multiple in-house genomics cohorts) representing diverse ethnic and geographically distinct Indian populations. Of the analyzed variants from Global Screening Array, ~9% were found to be informative and were either not known earlier or underrepresented in public databases in terms of their frequencies. These variants were linked to disorders, namely inborn errors of metabolism, monogenic diabetes, hereditary cancers, and various other hereditary conditions. We have also shown that our study cohort is genetically a better representative of the Indian population than its representation in the 1000 Genome Project (South Asians). We have created a database, ClinIndb, linked to the Leiden Open Variation Database, to help clinicians and researchers in diagnosis, counseling, and development of appropriate genetic screening tools relevant to the Indian populations and Indians living abroad.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ClinVar variants", "database", "high-throughput genotyping", "Indian populations", "monogenic diseases"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090445753", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"37000814800": {"Name": "Narang A.", "AuthorID": "37000814800", "AffiliationID": "60004009, 60019199", "AffiliationName": "Genomics and Molecular Medicine, CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology"}, "57211142662": {"Name": "Uppilli B.", "AuthorID": "57211142662", "AffiliationID": "60121522", "AffiliationName": "Academy of Scientific & Innovative Research (AcSIR)"}, "57218851852": {"Name": "Vivekanand A.", "AuthorID": "57218851852", "AffiliationID": "60121522", "AffiliationName": "Academy of Scientific & Innovative Research (AcSIR)"}, "57218855090": {"Name": "Naushin S.", "AuthorID": "57218855090", "AffiliationID": "60121522", "AffiliationName": "Academy of Scientific & Innovative Research (AcSIR)"}, "57218855187": {"Name": "Singhal K.", "AuthorID": "57218855187", "AffiliationID": "60121522", "AffiliationName": "Academy of Scientific & Innovative Research (AcSIR)"}, "57201301374": {"Name": "Shamim U.", "AuthorID": "57201301374", "AffiliationID": "60004009, 60019199", "AffiliationName": "Genomics and Molecular Medicine, CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology"}, "57211139110": {"Name": "Sharma P.", "AuthorID": "57211139110", "AffiliationID": "60121522", "AffiliationName": "Academy of Scientific & Innovative Research (AcSIR)"}, "57211140427": {"Name": "Zahra S.", "AuthorID": "57211140427", "AffiliationID": "60121522", "AffiliationName": "Academy of Scientific & Innovative Research (AcSIR)"}, "57217555804": {"Name": "Mathur A.", "AuthorID": "57217555804", "AffiliationID": "60004009, 60019199", "AffiliationName": "Genomics and Molecular Medicine, CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology"}, "57212706998": {"Name": "Seth M.", "AuthorID": "57212706998", "AffiliationID": "60004009, 60019199", "AffiliationName": "Genomics and Molecular Medicine, CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology"}, "57209095210": {"Name": "Parveen S.", "AuthorID": "57209095210", "AffiliationID": "60004009, 60019199", "AffiliationName": "Genomics and Molecular Medicine, CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology"}, "36640433500": {"Name": "Vats A.", "AuthorID": "36640433500", "AffiliationID": "60004009, 60019199", "AffiliationName": "Genomics and Molecular Medicine, CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology"}, "25226093200": {"Name": "Prasher B.", "AuthorID": "25226093200", "AffiliationID": "60004009, 60019199", "AffiliationName": "CSIR Ayurgenomics Unit-TRISUTRA, CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology"}, "7402546468": {"Name": "Sengupta S.", "AuthorID": "7402546468", "AffiliationID": "60121522", "AffiliationName": "Academy of Scientific & Innovative Research (AcSIR)"}, "6602114276": {"Name": "Mukerji M.", "AuthorID": "6602114276", "AffiliationID": "60004009, 60019199", "AffiliationName": "CSIR Ayurgenomics Unit-TRISUTRA, CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology"}, "35078329700": {"Name": "Faruq M.", "AuthorID": "35078329700", "AffiliationID": "60121522", "AffiliationName": "Academy of Scientific & Innovative Research (AcSIR)"}, "57218852697": {"Name": "Yadav A.", "AuthorID": "57218852697", "AffiliationID": "60004009, 60019199", "AffiliationName": "CSIR Ayurgenomics Unit-TRISUTRA, CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology"}, "36026129800": {"Name": "Varma B.", "AuthorID": "36026129800", "AffiliationID": "60004009, 60019199", "AffiliationName": "CSIR Ayurgenomics Unit-TRISUTRA, CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology"}, "56542968900": {"Name": "Hillman S.", "AuthorID": "56542968900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR UCL Clinical Lecturer and Subspecialty Trainee Maternal and Fetal Medicine, UCL Institute for Women's Health"}, "57218851234": {"Name": "Dolma P.", "AuthorID": "57218851234", "AffiliationID": "124938157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Sonam Norboo Memorial Hospital"}, "57193588775": {"Name": "Jain V.", "AuthorID": "57193588775", "AffiliationID": "60009790", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
