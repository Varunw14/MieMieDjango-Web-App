They are housed in the cochlea and convey sound information to the brain via synapses with the auditory nerve. IHCs have been thought to be electrically and metabolically independent from each other. We report that, upon developmental maturation, in mice 30% of the IHCs are electrochemically coupled in \u2018mini-syncytia\u2019. This coupling permits transfer of fluorescently-labeled metabolites and macromolecular tracers. The membrane capacitance, Ca2+-current, and resting current increase with the number of dye-coupled IHCs. Dual voltage-clamp experiments substantiate low resistance electrical coupling. Pharmacology and tracer permeability rule out coupling by gap junctions and purinoceptors. 3D electron microscopy indicates instead that IHCs are coupled by membrane fusion sites. Consequently, depolarization of one IHC triggers presynaptic Ca2+-influx at active zones in the entire mini-syncytium. Based on our findings and modeling, we propose that IHC-mini-syncytia enhance sensitivity and reliability of cochlear sound encoding.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Calcium Signaling", "Cochlea", "Cochlear Nerve", "Electron Microscope Tomography", "Giant Cells", "Hair Cells, Auditory, Inner", "Hearing", "Mice", "Patch-Clamp Techniques", "Rodentia", "Synapses"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086852880", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57200317681": {"Name": "Jean P.", "AuthorID": "57200317681", "AffiliationID": "60031514", "AffiliationName": "G\u00f6ttingen Graduate School for Neurosciences and Molecular Biosciences, University of G\u00f6ttingen"}, "57219821524": {"Name": "Anttonen T.", "AuthorID": "57219821524", "AffiliationID": "60032895", "AffiliationName": "Synaptic Nanophysiology Group, Max Planck Institute of Biophysical Chemistry"}, "7007050113": {"Name": "Moser T.", "AuthorID": "7007050113", "AffiliationID": "60031514", "AffiliationName": "Multiscale Bioimaging Cluster of Excellence (MBExC), University of G\u00f6ttingen"}, "56105227300": {"Name": "Michanski S.", "AuthorID": "56105227300", "AffiliationID": "120427854", "AffiliationName": "Center for Biostructural Imaging of Neurodegeneration"}, "57205720272": {"Name": "Kroll J.", "AuthorID": "57205720272", "AffiliationID": "120427854", "AffiliationName": "Center for Biostructural Imaging of Neurodegeneration"}, "6508049278": {"Name": "Pangr\u0161i\u010d T.", "AuthorID": "6508049278", "AffiliationID": "60021110", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Otology Group, Institute for Auditory Neuroscience, InnerEarLab, and Department of Otolaryngology, University Medical Center G\u00f6ttingen"}, "12775533400": {"Name": "Wichmann C.", "AuthorID": "12775533400", "AffiliationID": "60031514", "AffiliationName": "Multiscale Bioimaging Cluster of Excellence (MBExC), University of G\u00f6ttingen"}, "57217237350": {"Name": "de Diego A.M.G.", "AuthorID": "57217237350", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Ear Institute and Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7006771960": {"Name": "Ashmore J.", "AuthorID": "7006771960", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Ear Institute and Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "55988547000": {"Name": "Steyer A.M.", "AuthorID": "55988547000", "AffiliationID": "60031514", "AffiliationName": "Center for Nanoscale Microscopy and Molecular Physiology of the Brain, University of G\u00f6ttingen"}, "57208570319": {"Name": "Nardis C.", "AuthorID": "57208570319", "AffiliationID": "60031514", "AffiliationName": "Center for Nanoscale Microscopy and Molecular Physiology of the Brain, University of G\u00f6ttingen"}, "7004620433": {"Name": "M\u00f6bius W.", "AuthorID": "7004620433", "AffiliationID": "60031514", "AffiliationName": "Center for Nanoscale Microscopy and Molecular Physiology of the Brain, University of G\u00f6ttingen"}, "6701446598": {"Name": "Neef A.", "AuthorID": "6701446598", "AffiliationID": "60031514", "AffiliationName": "Neurophysics laboratory, Campus Institute for Dynamics of Biological Networks, University of G\u00f6ttingen"}, "57208147650": {"Name": "Oestreicher D.", "AuthorID": "57208147650", "AffiliationID": "60021110", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Otology Group, Institute for Auditory Neuroscience, InnerEarLab, and Department of Otolaryngology, University Medical Center G\u00f6ttingen"}}}
