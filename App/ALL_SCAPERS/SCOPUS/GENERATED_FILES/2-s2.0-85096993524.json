Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Renewable technologies, and in particular the electric vehicle revolution, have generated tremendous pressure for the improvement of lithium ion battery performance. To meet the increasingly high market demand, challenges include improving the energy density, extending cycle life and enhancing safety. In order to address these issues, a deep understanding of both the physical and chemical changes of battery materials under working conditions is crucial for linking degradation processes to their origins in material properties and their electrochemical signatures. In situ and operando synchrotron-based X-ray techniques provide powerful tools for battery materials research, allowing a deep understanding of structural evolution, redox processes and transport properties during cycling. In this review, in situ synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction methods are discussed in detail with an emphasis on recent advancements in improving the spatial and temporal resolution. The experimental approaches reviewed here include cell designs and materials, as well as beamline experimental setup details. Finally, future challenges and opportunities for battery technologies are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Battery technology", "In-situ XRD", "Lithium-ion batteries", "Operando analysis", "Synchrotron X-ray characterization"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096993524", "SubjectAreas": [["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"]], "AuthorData": {"57216583894": {"Name": "Llewellyn A.V.", "AuthorID": "57216583894", "AffiliationID": "60172680", "AffiliationName": "The Faraday Institution, Quad One, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "57034251300": {"Name": "Matruglio A.", "AuthorID": "57034251300", "AffiliationID": "60172680", "AffiliationName": "The Faraday Institution, Quad One, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.J.L.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60172680", "AffiliationName": "The Faraday Institution, Quad One, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "56110123700": {"Name": "Jervis R.", "AuthorID": "56110123700", "AffiliationID": "60172680", "AffiliationName": "The Faraday Institution, Quad One, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.R.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60172680", "AffiliationName": "The Faraday Institution, Quad One, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}}}
