The king of Poland, Stephen Bathory (1533-86), suffered from CKD due to polycystic kidney disease and depression [2]. Similarly, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was also thought to have had CKD [3] and depression [4]. A list of 'Famous People Who Have Died from Kidney Disease' [5] includes many who suffered from both CKD and depression or other signs of mental illness. Is this a coincidence or actually evidence of a link between kidney disease and brain dysfunction? This is not merely an academic question because all forms of mental illness can seriously impair an individual's quality of life, and are frequently associated with progression of diseases and premature mortality, so it is worth the effort of trying to answer it. Europe and much of the industrialized countries are experiencing growing numbers of patients with CKD within their ageing populations [6]. CKD is complex and potentially fatal: (i) all organs are affected, sooner or later; (ii) the balance of plasma volume, electrolytes, acid-base and minerals, metabolites, hormones and proteins is disturbed; and (iii) patients often need a multidisciplinary team approach managing complex comorbidities, drug regimens and special diets. Although the prognosis of patients with CKD remains poor, their increasing life expectancy has shifted medical attention from life-threatening emergencies to long-term complications and sequelae, and how to improve quality of life [7]. Indeed, kidney failure has detrimental effects on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), reaching levels similar to those seen in patients with metastatic cancer [8]. This might be due to psychological factors, both kidney disease and cancer being chronic diseases with a bad prognosis. However, although the effect of CKD on quality of life is more evident in advanced stages (stage G4P) and in older patients [9, 10], a large study has shown a significant decrease in HRQoL as early as CKD stage G2 [11]. Notably, neurological and cognitive impairments [12], and depression [13] are among the most debilitating consequences of CKD contributing to the significantly reduced HRQoL [14].", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077949023", "SubjectAreas": [["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"55944068400": {"Name": "Viggiano D.", "AuthorID": "55944068400", "AffiliationID": "60026777", "AffiliationName": "Department of Translational Medical Sciences, University of Campania 'Luigi Vanvitelli'"}, "9276633500": {"Name": "Trepiccione F.", "AuthorID": "9276633500", "AffiliationID": "60117464", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetic and Translational Medicine"}, "35599101500": {"Name": "Capasso G.", "AuthorID": "35599101500", "AffiliationID": "60117464", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetic and Translational Medicine"}, "7402148810": {"Name": "Wagner C.A.", "AuthorID": "7402148810", "AffiliationID": "60012614, 60019619", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physiology, University of Zurich"}, "7006397092": {"Name": "Blankestijn P.J.", "AuthorID": "7006397092", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, University Medical Center"}, "6602659946": {"Name": "Bruchfeld A.", "AuthorID": "6602659946", "AffiliationID": "60019295, 60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Renal Medicine, CLINTEC, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital"}, "7005165997": {"Name": "Fliser D.", "AuthorID": "7005165997", "AffiliationID": "60023686", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine IV-Nephrology and Hypertension, Saarland University Medical Centre"}, "7005189618": {"Name": "Fouque D.", "AuthorID": "7005189618", "AffiliationID": "60102126, 60001780", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology Dialysis, Nutrition, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon"}, "6603308740": {"Name": "Frische S.", "AuthorID": "6603308740", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedicine, University of Aarhus"}, "54938105400": {"Name": "Gesualdo L.", "AuthorID": "54938105400", "AffiliationID": "60170549, 60022778", "AffiliationName": "Division of Nephrology, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Policlinico, Bari and University 'Aldo Moro' of Bari"}, "55824326600": {"Name": "Pesce F.", "AuthorID": "55824326600", "AffiliationID": "60170549, 60022778", "AffiliationName": "Division of Nephrology, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Policlinico, Bari and University 'Aldo Moro' of Bari"}, "57215297324": {"Name": "Guti\u00e9rrez E.", "AuthorID": "57215297324", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Medicine, Center of Functionally Integrative Neuroscience, University of Aarhus"}, "6603709366": {"Name": "Goumenos D.", "AuthorID": "6603709366", "AffiliationID": "60024484", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, University Hospital of Patras"}, "6508158988": {"Name": "Hoorn E.J.", "AuthorID": "6508158988", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Nephrology and Transplantation, Erasmus Medical Center, University Medical Center Rotterdam"}, "57217193173": {"Name": "Eckardt K.U.", "AuthorID": "57217193173", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology and Medical Intensive Care, Charit\u00e9-Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin"}, "57193457273": {"Name": "K\u00f6nig M.", "AuthorID": "57193457273", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology and Medical Intensive Care, Charit\u00e9-Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin"}, "55191395200": {"Name": "Knau\u00df S.", "AuthorID": "55191395200", "AffiliationID": "60026245, 60106629, 60000762, 60030718, 60126120", "AffiliationName": "Klinik f\u00fcr Neurologie Mit Experimenteller Neurologie, Charit\u00e9 -
