Objective: To review the association between maternal thyroid dysfunction and the risk of adverse outcomes in offspring. Data Sources: PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library. Study Selections: Eligible studies reported the association between maternal thyroid hormone function and the risk of adverse outcomes in their children. Data Extraction: Reviewers extracted data on study characteristics and results independently. Data Synthesis: Estimates were pooled and reported as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). I2 tests were applied to assess the heterogeneity across studies. Results: We identified 29 eligible articles and found an association between maternal hyperthyroidism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.04-1.34, I2 = 0%) and epilepsy (OR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.08-1.31, I2 = 0%) in offspring; as well as an association of maternal hypothyroidism with increased risk of ADHD (OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.03-1.26, I2 = 25%), autism spectrum disorder (OR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.05-1.90, I2 = 63%), and epilepsy (OR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.06-1.39, I2 = 0%) in offspring. Conclusion: Routine measurement and timely treatment on thyroid function should be considered for pregnant women.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Child development", "Gestation", "Neurodevelopmental disorders", "Offspring", "Pregnancy", "Thyroid"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092332251", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Biochemistry (medical)", "MEDI", "2704"]], "AuthorData": {"57217181441": {"Name": "Ge G.M.", "AuthorID": "57217181441", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong"}, "57199738698": {"Name": "Leung M.T.Y.", "AuthorID": "57199738698", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong"}, "55883514900": {"Name": "Man K.K.C.", "AuthorID": "55883514900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Practice and Policy, UCL, School of Pharmacy"}, "35080710200": {"Name": "Li G.H.Y.", "AuthorID": "35080710200", "AffiliationID": "60008928", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Technology and Informatics, Hong Kong Polytechnic University"}, "7102513915": {"Name": "Wong I.C.K.", "AuthorID": "7102513915", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Practice and Policy, UCL, School of Pharmacy"}, "14520953400": {"Name": "Cheung C.L.", "AuthorID": "14520953400", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong"}, "7201504435": {"Name": "Leung W.C.", "AuthorID": "7201504435", "AffiliationID": "60024384", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Kwong Wah Hospital"}, "7003622681": {"Name": "Ip P.", "AuthorID": "7003622681", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong"}, "57052347500": {"Name": "Kung A.W.C.", "AuthorID": "57052347500", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong"}}}
