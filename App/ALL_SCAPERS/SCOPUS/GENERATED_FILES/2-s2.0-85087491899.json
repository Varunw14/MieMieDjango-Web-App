Instead, I will show how opera (both the form and the repertoire) served as a means of creating cultural and intellectual connections between peoples, and how it participated in the emergence of a European public. Claims that particular operas played a role in rousing nationalist sentiment are often methodologically unsound, due to the limitations of related sources of reception; or they are based on myths that were constructed long after these works\u2019 original production. Moreover, even works written or described at the time as explicitly \u2018national\u2019 operas often relied on musical techniques amalgamated from different national contexts, raising questions over their classification in terms of national culture. Instead, Italian opera in particular assumed a central role in building cultural bridges between and within nations and polities. This was especially the case for the Habsburg monarchy, where opera was understood as a reference to Italy\u2019s humanist legacy, based on a long tradition of reading opera as the reinvention of Greek drama. After 1815 and throughout the 1820s, the triumph of Rossini\u2019s works on almost every stage in Europe shows how opera transcended barriers between peoples, states and nations. A mere \u2018national\u2019 reading of such works risks missing the point of why opera became a European art form of a truly global appeal.", "AuthorKeywords": ["German history", "Habsburg Empire", "Italian history", "Nationalism", "Opera", "Transnationalism"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087491899", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"36003205600": {"Name": "K\u00f6rner A.", "AuthorID": "36003205600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
