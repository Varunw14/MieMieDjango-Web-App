As MaaS continues to gain traction globally in the customer-led economy, more attention is needed on the role of customers in MaaS enablement. This paper thus serves as a starting point for future research on customer-led mobility. After MaaS is briefly defined and explored using a short case study, this paper proceeds to lay out a research agenda for MaaS enablement, thereby setting the stage for future work on evolving customer behaviors and preferences in MaaS ecosystems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Customers", "Integrated mobility", "Intelligent transport systems", "Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS)"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095873146", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"57207251734": {"Name": "Casady C.B.", "AuthorID": "57207251734", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London"}}}
