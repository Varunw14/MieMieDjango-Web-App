Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is increasing in incidence worldwide and requires new approaches to therapy. The combination of anti-angiogenic drug therapy and radiotherapy is one promising new approach. The anti-angiogenic drug vandetanib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and RET proto-oncogene with radio-enhancement potential. To explore the benefit of combined vandetanib and radiotherapy treatment for HCC, we studied outcomes following combined treatment in pre-clinical models. Methods: Vandetanib and radiation treatment were combined in HCC cell lines grown in vitro and in vivo. In addition to 2D migration and clonogenic assays, the combination was studied in 3D spheroids and a syngeneic mouse model of HCC. Results: Vandetanib IC50 s were measured in 20 cell lines and the drug was found to significantly enhance radiation cell kill and to inhibit both cell migration and invasion in vitro. In vivo, combination therapy significantly reduced cancer growth and improved overall survival, an effect that persisted for the duration of vandetanib treatment. Conclusion: In 2D and 3D studies in vitro and in a syngeneic model in vivo, the combination of vandetanib plus radiotherapy was more efficacious than either treatment alone. This new combination therapy for HCC merits evaluation in clinical trials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D models", "Angiogenesis", "Animal model", "Hepatocellular carcinoma", "Immunocompetent", "Radiosensitiser", "Radiotherapy", "Syngeneic", "Vandetanib", "Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087892716", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"57211242130": {"Name": "Znati S.", "AuthorID": "57211242130", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57198722693": {"Name": "Carter R.", "AuthorID": "57198722693", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57218099071": {"Name": "Vasquez M.", "AuthorID": "57218099071", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57115402200": {"Name": "Westhorpe A.", "AuthorID": "57115402200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57220250265": {"Name": "Shahbakhti H.", "AuthorID": "57220250265", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57215045221": {"Name": "Vlckova P.", "AuthorID": "57215045221", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57218096292": {"Name": "De Vellis C.", "AuthorID": "57218096292", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Scuola di Scienze Matematiche, Fisiche e Naturali, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Firenze"}, "7407243601": {"Name": "Sharma R.A.", "AuthorID": "7407243601", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57218109700": {"Name": "Prince J.", "AuthorID": "57218109700", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, University of Oxford"}, "57190176568": {"Name": "Bascal Z.", "AuthorID": "57190176568", "AffiliationID": "122725687", "AffiliationName": "Biocompatibles UK Ltd.
