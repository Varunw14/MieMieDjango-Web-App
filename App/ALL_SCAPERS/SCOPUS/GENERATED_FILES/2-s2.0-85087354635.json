An important aspect of healthy aging is preserved cognitive function (CF). The relationship of age-related changes in CF with the status of economic activity during aging in the Russian population has not been systematically studied. Aim of study \u2014 to study the relationship of age-dependent dynamics of indicators of CF with the status of economic activity in 2-series measurements over 9 years in the Russian population sample from middle to senile age. Material and methods. The study was conducted on the data of random population sample of Novosibirsk residents 45\u201469 years old, examined initially in 2003\u20142005. (HAPIEE project, 9360 participants). Repeated two-time examinations (2nd and 3rd screenings) were conducted in a random subsample (1587 participants), which was included in this analysis. The mean follow-up was 8.9 years. Testing of CF was performed by standard methods, including the direct and delayed reproduction of \u201c10 words,\u201d semantic speech activity, and concentration. Standardized questionnaires were used to determine the status of economic activity. Results. In the studied population subsample, which included 1587 participants (63% were women), the average age at the 2nd screening was 61.0\u00b16.8 years, and at the 3rd screening it was 69.9\u00b16.9 years. Over 9 years of follow-up, dynamic regression was revealed in all cognitive domains in the group of men (p<0.001) and in the test of delayed reproduction and categorical verbal activity in women (p<0.001) regardless of the status of economic activity. In men, cessation of labor activity was associated with a higher rate of decline in direct (p=0.044) and delayed (p=0.037) reproduction compared to economically active participants, regardless of age and level of education. Conclusions. In the Novosibirsk population sample, persisting economically active status in elderly people was associated with slower rate of cognitive decline. Results suggest a potential protective effect of stimulating employment-related activities on cognitive regression in the elderly population.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aging", "Cognitive decline", "Cognitive functions", "Economic activity", "Population"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087354635", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57207032758": {"Name": "Titarenko A.V.", "AuthorID": "57207032758", "AffiliationID": "60068684, 60017604", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute of Internal and Preventive Medicine \u2014 Branch of Federal Research Center Institute of Cytology and Genetics, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "56221217700": {"Name": "Shishkin S.V.", "AuthorID": "56221217700", "AffiliationID": "60068684, 60017604", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute of Internal and Preventive Medicine \u2014 Branch of Federal Research Center Institute of Cytology and Genetics, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "15030341800": {"Name": "Shcherbakova L.V.", "AuthorID": "15030341800", "AffiliationID": "60068684, 60017604", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute of Internal and Preventive Medicine \u2014 Branch of Federal Research Center Institute of Cytology and Genetics, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "21735150600": {"Name": "Verevkin E.G.", "AuthorID": "21735150600", "AffiliationID": "60068684, 60017604", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute of Internal and Preventive Medicine \u2014 Branch of Federal Research Center Institute of Cytology and Genetics, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "6603876724": {"Name": "Malyutina S.K.", "AuthorID": "6603876724", "AffiliationID": "60068684, 60017604", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute of Internal and Preventive Medicine \u2014 Branch of Federal Research Center Institute of Cytology and Genetics, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "7102613233": {"Name": "Hubacek J.", "AuthorID": "7102613233", "AffiliationID": "60020529", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical and Experimental Medicine"}, "7005266289": {"Name": "Bobak M.", "AuthorID": "7005266289", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College of London"}}}
