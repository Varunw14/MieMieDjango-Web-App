ONSF is a currently invasive ophthalmic surgical approach that can reduce potentially blinding elevated hydrostatic intracranial pressure on the optic disc via an incision on the optic nerve. The prototype is a multi-arm system capable of dexterous manipulation and visualization of the optic nerve area, allowing for a minimally invasive approach. Each arm is an independently controlled concentric tube robot collimated by a bespoke guide that is secured on the eye sclera via sutures. In this article, we consider the robot's end-effector design in order to reach/navigate the optic nerve according to the clinical requirements of ONSF. A prototype of the robot was engineered, and its ability to penetrate the optic nerve was analysed by conducting ex vivo experiments on porcine optic nerves and comparing their stiffness to human ones. The robot was successfully deployed in a custom-made realistic eye phantom. Our simulation studies and experimental results demonstrate that the robot can successfully navigate to the operation site and carry out the intervention.", "AuthorKeywords": ["mechanism design", "medical robots and systems", "steerable catheters/needles", "Surgical robotics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Concentric tube", "Continuum robot", "Dexterous manipulation", "Intra-cranial pressure", "Minimally invasive", "Robot's end effectors", "Robotic systems", "Simulation studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088110703", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"57191056520": {"Name": "Mitros Z.", "AuthorID": "57191056520", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, Robotics and Vision in Medicine (RViM) Lab, King's College London"}, "57188663416": {"Name": "Sadati S.", "AuthorID": "57188663416", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, Robotics and Vision in Medicine (RViM) Lab, King's College London"}, "55808126500": {"Name": "Seneci C.", "AuthorID": "55808126500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, Robotics and Vision in Medicine (RViM) Lab, King's College London"}, "26422797000": {"Name": "Bergeles C.", "AuthorID": "26422797000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, Robotics and Vision in Medicine (RViM) Lab, King's College London"}, "54402255500": {"Name": "Bloch E.", "AuthorID": "54402255500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences, University College London"}, "56001386300": {"Name": "Leibrandt K.", "AuthorID": "56001386300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences, University College London"}, "57215558582": {"Name": "Cruz L.D.", "AuthorID": "57215558582", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences, University College London"}, "56743015600": {"Name": "Khadem M.", "AuthorID": "56743015600", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh"}}}
