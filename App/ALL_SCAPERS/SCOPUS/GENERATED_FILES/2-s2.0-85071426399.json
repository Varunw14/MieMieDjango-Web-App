Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Drought in Australia has widespread impacts on agriculture and ecosystems. Satellite-based Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) has great potential to monitor and assess drought impacts on vegetation greenness and health. Various FAPAR products based on satellite observations have been generated and made available to the public. However, differences remain among these datasets due to different retrieval methodologies and assumptions. The Quality Assurance for Essential Climate Variables (QA4ECV) project recently developed a quality assurance framework to provide understandable and traceable quality information for Essential ClimateVariables (ECVs). The QA4ECV FAPAR is one of these ECVs. The aim of this study is to investigate the capability of QA4ECV FAPAR for drought monitoring in Australia. Through spatial and temporal comparison and correlation analysis with widely used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Satellite Pour l\u2019Observation de la Terre (SPOT)/PROBA-V FAPAR generated by Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS), and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) drought index, as well as the European Space Agency\u2019s Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) soil moisture, the study shows that theQA4ECVFAPARcan support agricultural drought monitoring and assessment in Australia. The traceable and reliable uncertainties associated with the QA4ECV FAPAR provide valuable information for applications that use the QA4ECV FAPAR dataset in the future.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Australia", "CGLS", "Drought", "FAPAR", "MODIS", "QA4ECV"], "IndexKeywords": ["Australia", "CGLS", "FAPAR", "MODIS", "QA4ECV"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071426399", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57205067933": {"Name": "Peng J.", "AuthorID": "57205067933", "AffiliationID": "60033100", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Climate and Global Change Research, School of Atmospheric Sciences, Nanjing University"}, "6507351719": {"Name": "Dadson S.", "AuthorID": "6507351719", "AffiliationID": "60175816", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography and the Environment, University of Oxford"}, "57221316608": {"Name": "Ludwig R.", "AuthorID": "57221316608", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University of Munich (LMU)"}, "57191170893": {"Name": "M\u00fcller B.", "AuthorID": "57191170893", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University of Munich (LMU)"}, "7404871794": {"Name": "Muller J.P.", "AuthorID": "7404871794", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Imaging Group, Mullard Space Sciences Laboratory, University College London, Department of Space and Climate Physics"}, "24477084600": {"Name": "Kharbouche S.", "AuthorID": "24477084600", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Imaging Group, Mullard Space Sciences Laboratory, University College London, Department of Space and Climate Physics"}, "23666206000": {"Name": "Blessing S.", "AuthorID": "23666206000", "AffiliationID": "60077439", "AffiliationName": "FastOpt GmbH"}, "55911428100": {"Name": "Giering R.", "AuthorID": "55911428100", "AffiliationID": "60077439", "AffiliationName": "FastOpt GmbH"}, "26430815000": {"Name": "Danne O.", "AuthorID": "26430815000", "AffiliationID": "60120137", "AffiliationName": "Brockmann Consult GmbH"}, "6701592812": {"Name": "Gobron N.", "AuthorID": "6701592812", "AffiliationID": "60103695", "AffiliationName": "European Commission, Joint Research Centre"}, "55073323400": {"Name": "Leng G.", "AuthorID": "55073323400", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Institute, University of Oxford"}, "22982141200": {"Name": "You Q.", "AuthorID": "22982141200", "AffiliationID": "60009860", "AffiliationName": "Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences & Institute of Atmospheric Sciences, Fudan University"}, "35181109400": {"Name": "Duan Z.", "AuthorID": "35181109400", "AffiliationID": "60117630, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "Lancaster Environment Centre, Lancaster University"}}}
