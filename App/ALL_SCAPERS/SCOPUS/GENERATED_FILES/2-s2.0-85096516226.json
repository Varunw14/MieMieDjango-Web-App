All rights reserved.Introduction: low levels of contraceptive use in Western Africa are responsible for high fertility rates, which limits economic development. The cost of modern contraceptives is a significant constraint, then the government of Burkina Faso has implemented free family planning. Given this new policy, we provided rural women with a healthcare voucher giving free access to modern contraceptives. We conducted an analysis of the determinants of good free voucher use in order to implement adequate government policy. Methods: six months after the distribution of vouchers to women living in 30 villages in the Houet Province, we conducted a focus-group study based on individual in-depth health care provider interviews in partner healthcare centers. Results: the benefits of family planning, free contraceptive use, husband\u2019s approval and moral obligation were factors facilitating voucher use. The desire to become pregnant, husband\u2019s opposition, women\u2019s reluctance, women\u2019s lack of knowledge of contraceptives and factors associated with the intervention were the leading reasons for not using the vouchers. Conclusion: the promotion of modern contraceptive use among married women or concubines requires a holistic approach combining free access to modern contraceptives, effective policies involving men in family planning and the reduction of fertility preferences among the couples.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Burkina Faso", "Family planning", "Vouchers"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Burkina Faso", "Contraception Behavior", "Contraceptive Agents", "Family Planning Services", "Female", "Focus Groups", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Health Services Accessibility", "Humans", "Marriage", "Rural Population", "Spouses", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096516226", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57204959931": {"Name": "Bakyono R.", "AuthorID": "57204959931", "AffiliationID": "60072110", "AffiliationName": "Centre MURAZ"}, "57209467369": {"Name": "Tapsoba L.D.G.", "AuthorID": "57209467369", "AffiliationID": "60072110", "AffiliationName": "Centre MURAZ"}, "22956866700": {"Name": "Berth\u00e9 A.", "AuthorID": "22956866700", "AffiliationID": "120897112", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de D\u00e9dougou"}, "55537012400": {"Name": "L\u00e9pine A.", "AuthorID": "55537012400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56001606200": {"Name": "Ilboudo P.G.", "AuthorID": "56001606200", "AffiliationID": "119636909", "AffiliationName": "Independent Researcher"}, "57159730600": {"Name": "Diallo C.O.", "AuthorID": "57159730600", "AffiliationID": "112759079", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Recherche en Sciences de la Sant\u00e9"}, "7005323005": {"Name": "M\u00e9da N.", "AuthorID": "7005323005", "AffiliationID": "123226328", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Joseph Ki-Zerbo"}, "57200179541": {"Name": "D\u2019exelle B.", "AuthorID": "57200179541", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "University of East Anglia"}}}
