{"Title": "Does modularity of metal-on-metal hip implants increase cobalt: chromium ratio?", "Year": 2021, "Source": "HIP Int.", "Volume": "31", "Issue": 1, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 109, "PageEnd": 114, "CitedBy": 0, "DOI": "10.1177/1120700019873637", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85099173050&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2019.Background: Blood metal ion levels are used in the surveillance of metal-on-metal (MoM) hip implants. Modular implants contain an extra source of metal debris that may affect the ratio of metal ions in the blood. Methods: This was a retrospective study of 503 patients with hip replacements made by a single manufacturer (Smith & Nephew, Warwick, UK) with the same bearing surface. There were 54 total hip arthroplasties, 35 Birmingham Mid-Head Resections and 414 hip resurfacings. Whole blood metal ion levels and their ratios were analysed to investigate the effect of a modular junction. Results: The cobalt:chromium ratios were greater in the total hip arthroplasty group (mean 2.3:1) when compared to the resurfacings group (mean 1.3:1, p = <0.05) and Birmingham Mid-Head Resection group (mean 1.1:1, p = 0.11). Conclusions: This study demonstrated a trend for a higher cobalt:chromium ratio in patients with MoM total hip replacement that may be due to metal debris from the modular stem-head junction. Further work is required to correlate clinical data with retrieval analysis to confirm the effect of taper material loss on the cobalt:chromium ratio.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Arthroplasty", "blood metal ions", "hip", "modular"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85099173050", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"6506667612": {"Name": "Ilo K.C.", "AuthorID": "6506667612", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics, Musculoskeletal Science (University College London), Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "57220310710": {"Name": "Aboelmagd K.", "AuthorID": "57220310710", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics, Musculoskeletal Science (University College London), Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "6506962865": {"Name": "Hothi H.S.", "AuthorID": "6506962865", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics, Musculoskeletal Science (University College London), Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "56416257200": {"Name": "Asaad A.", "AuthorID": "56416257200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics, Musculoskeletal Science (University College London), Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "57221463135": {"Name": "Skinner J.A.", "AuthorID": "57221463135", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics, Musculoskeletal Science (University College London), Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "57217429146": {"Name": "Hart A.J.", "AuthorID": "57217429146", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics, Musculoskeletal Science (University College London), Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}}}
