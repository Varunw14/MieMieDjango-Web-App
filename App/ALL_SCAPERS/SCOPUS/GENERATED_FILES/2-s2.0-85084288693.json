A combination of lux measurements inside and outside a historic showroom and recording of sunshine hours have been used together with a log of the room blind operation to understand the daylight characteristics of the room under different weather conditions, blinds settings and season. Average lux, daily lux hour dose, time below 30 lux and daylight factor metrics have been derived to assess daylight conditions over a 10-month period for both conservation of light-sensitive collections and the viewing experience of visitors. Recommendations are made on how to improve daylight management for conservation and visitor experience.", "AuthorKeywords": ["collections", "Daylight", "historic building", "illuminance", "interiors", "light sensitive"], "IndexKeywords": ["Blind operation", "Daylight factors", "Historic house", "In-Situ Study", "Sunshine Hour", "Visitor experiences"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084288693", "SubjectAreas": [["Conservation", "ARTS", "1206"]], "AuthorData": {"6506436366": {"Name": "Blades N.", "AuthorID": "6506436366", "AffiliationID": "60108950", "AffiliationName": "National Trust"}, "57216688719": {"Name": "O\u2019Hagan L.", "AuthorID": "57216688719", "AffiliationID": "60108950", "AffiliationName": "National Trust"}, "6603346292": {"Name": "Mardaljevic J.", "AuthorID": "6603346292", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, Building & Civil Engineering, Loughborough University"}, "20434262600": {"Name": "Lithgow K.", "AuthorID": "20434262600", "AffiliationID": "60108950", "AffiliationName": "Formerly National Trust"}, "6508144304": {"Name": "Cannon-Brookes S.", "AuthorID": "6508144304", "AffiliationID": "117559702", "AffiliationName": "Cannon-Brookes Lighting & Design"}, "57216694541": {"Name": "McGrady S.", "AuthorID": "57216694541", "AffiliationID": "60108950", "AffiliationName": "National Trust, Ham House"}}}
