Such displays incorporate their own integrated photometer, so could potentially be used \u2018straight out of the box\u2019, without the need for time-consuming and costly luminance calibration by skilled experts. Concerns remain, however, due to the fact that the internal calibration of such devices is imperfect, and lingering doubts regarding the accuracy of screen-based perimetry in general. To evaluate such a system, automated static threshold perimetry was performed in thirty-two normal-sighted adults. In one condition, participants performed a novel screen-based perimetry test, for which the screen was calibrated extensively using traditional photometric techniques/equipment. In a second condition, the same test was performed, but the display was calibrated using only the screen's integrated photometer (and assuming uniformity across the display). For reference, participants also completed a traditional visual-field assessment using a Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA). All three tests were performed twice to assess test-retest repeatability (six tests total). The results showed no differences when comparing screen-based perimetric measurements made with internal self-calibration vs full manual calibration (either in terms of mean sensitivity, pointwise sensitivity, test-retest repeatability, or test duration). Furthermore, the accuracy and precision of both were indistinguishable from the current gold standard (HFA), although the HFA was approximately two minutes (~30%) faster. These results indicate that self-calibrating commercial monitors can be used to perform screen-based perimetry almost as well as current clinical devices, and without the need for any specialized knowledge or equipment to setup or maintain. This could facilitate perimetric testing in currently hard-to-reach settings, such as community centers, stroke wards, homes, rural locations, or developing countries.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Contrast sensitivity", "Eye-movements", "Perimetry", "Photometry", "Screen calibration", "Visual fields"], "IndexKeywords": ["Accuracy and precision", "Contrast sensitivity", "Internal calibration", "Perimetry", "Photometric - techniques", "Screen calibrations", "Specialized knowledge", "Visual fields"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073032362", "SubjectAreas": [["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57211215876": {"Name": "Han H.K.", "AuthorID": "57211215876", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London (UCL)"}, "57079316000": {"Name": "Jones P.R.", "AuthorID": "57079316000", "AffiliationID": "112586584", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Moorfields Biomedical Research Centre"}}}
