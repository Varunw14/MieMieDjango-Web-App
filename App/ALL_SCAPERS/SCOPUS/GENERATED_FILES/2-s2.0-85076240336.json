Water column observations reveal an \u223c200 m thick plume head \u223c650 m above the seafloor, which corresponds to a hydrothermal heat output of \u223c200 \u00b1 100 MW at the ridge axis. Assuming a hydrothermal vent temperature of 350 \u00b0C and a discharge area between 104 and 105 m2, this heat output implies a mean crustal permeability within the discharge zone of between 2\u00d710\u221214 and 6\u00d710\u221213 m2, and a conductive thermal boundary layer thickness of \u223c20 m. The volume of magma required to maintain the current hydrothermal heat output over the past two decades should result in an across-axis axial magma lens (AML) width between 270 and 1300 m, depending on the amount of cooling and crystallization. However, seismic reflection images, acquired in 1994 and 2015, while showing an apparent along-axis growth of the AML from 2.4 to 6.0 km between surveys, also suggest that, as of 2015, the AML has an apparent across-axis width of no more than 300 m, and that magma delivery at the intermediate spreading rate CRR may be episodic on time scales of tens of years. The data on magma-hydrothermal interactions at the CRR collected in 1994 and 2015 suggest that the hydrothermal system may have significantly cooled and crystallized the AML, primarily in the across-axis direction, and that this hydrothermal system may also episodically turn on and off. The current pattern of microseismicity supports this conclusion, with events not only mirroring the AML depth and location beneath the ridge axis, but also having a temporally varying focus.", "AuthorKeywords": ["axial magma lens", "Costa Rica Rift", "hydrothermal processes", "multichannel seismic data"], "IndexKeywords": ["Costa Rica", "Crustal permeability", "Hydrothermal process", "Hydrothermal system", "Multi-channel seismic", "Multi-channel seismic datum", "Seismic reflections", "Thermal boundary layer"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85076240336", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"7005928572": {"Name": "Lowell R.P.", "AuthorID": "7005928572", "AffiliationID": "60027090", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geosciences, Virginia Tech"}, "57193848895": {"Name": "Kolandaivelu K.", "AuthorID": "57193848895", "AffiliationID": "60027090", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geosciences, Virginia Tech"}, "57212219459": {"Name": "Maqueda M.A.M.", "AuthorID": "57212219459", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "School of Natural and Environmental Sciences, Newcastle University"}, "55367125400": {"Name": "Banyte D.", "AuthorID": "55367125400", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "School of Natural and Environmental Sciences, Newcastle University"}, "57212218356": {"Name": "Zhang L.", "AuthorID": "57212218356", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College"}, "55514881300": {"Name": "Tong V.C.H.", "AuthorID": "55514881300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College"}, "7405694451": {"Name": "Harris R.N.", "AuthorID": "7405694451", "AffiliationID": "60013402", "AffiliationName": "College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences, Oregon State University"}, "55804203700": {"Name": "Johnston R.E.R.", "AuthorID": "55804203700", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Durham University"}, "7202266452": {"Name": "Hobbs R.W.", "AuthorID": "7202266452", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Durham University"}, "6602175860": {"Name": "Peirce C.", "AuthorID": "6602175860", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Durham University"}, "57198789548": {"Name": "Robinson A.H.", "AuthorID": "57198789548", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Durham University"}}}
