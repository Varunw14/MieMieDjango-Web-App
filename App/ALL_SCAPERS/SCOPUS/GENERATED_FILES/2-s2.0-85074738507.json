Accordingly, numerous lipid biosynthesis enzymes are localized in the ER membrane. However, it is now evident that lipid metabolism is sub-compartmentalized within the ER and that lipid biosynthetic enzymes engage with lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) to rapidly shuttle newly synthesized lipids from the ER to other organelles. As such, intimate relationships between lipid metabolism and lipid transfer pathways exist within the ER network. Notably, certain LTPs enhance the activities of lipid metabolizing enzymes; likewise, lipid metabolism can ensure the specificity of LTP transfer/exchange reactions. Yet, our understanding of these mutual relationships is still emerging. Here, we highlight past and recent key findings on specialized ER membrane domains involved in efficient lipid metabolism and transport and consider unresolved issues in the field.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Endoplasmic reticulum", "Lipid transfer protein", "Membrane contact sites", "Phospholipid biosynthesizing enzyme", "Plasma membrane"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biological Transport", "Biosynthetic Pathways", "Carrier Proteins", "Endoplasmic Reticulum", "Humans", "Lipid Metabolism", "Phospholipids"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074738507", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"8674063400": {"Name": "Nishimura T.", "AuthorID": "8674063400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "7004369690": {"Name": "Stefan C.J.", "AuthorID": "7004369690", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}}}
