It is a nonlinear system and is sensitive to both external disturbances and system uncertainty. Given these challenges, a nonsingular terminal sliding mode observer is proposed to estimate any external disturbance. Then, a continuous adaptive sliding mode control method is combined with the proposed disturbance observer. This is found to reduce chattering and improve control accuracy when compared with other methods. A full Lyapunov stability proof of the resulting closed-loop system is performed and the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by simulation experiments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adaptive sliding mode control", "CSTR", "Disturbance observer"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074386979", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"]], "AuthorData": {"57211561286": {"Name": "Ye Z.", "AuthorID": "57211561286", "AffiliationID": "60105111", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemical Engineering, China University of Petroleum"}, "35203196500": {"Name": "Dongya Z.", "AuthorID": "35203196500", "AffiliationID": "60105111", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemical Engineering, China University of Petroleum"}, "57211561584": {"Name": "Spurgeon Sarah K.", "AuthorID": "57211561584", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
