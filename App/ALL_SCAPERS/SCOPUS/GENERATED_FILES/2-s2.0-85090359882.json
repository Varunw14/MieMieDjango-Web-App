The collected examples were used to devise an approximate taxonomy of criminal applications for the purpose of assessing their relative threat levels. The exercise culminated in a 2-day workshop on 'AI & Future Crime' with representatives from academia, police, defence, government and the private sector. The workshop remit was (i) to catalogue potential criminal and terror threats arising from increasing adoption and power of artificial intelligence, and (ii) to rank these threats in terms of expected victim harm, criminal profit, criminal achievability and difficulty of defeat. Eighteen categories of threat were identified and rated. Five of the six highest-rated had a broad societal impact, such as those involving AI-generated fake content, or could operate at scale through use of AI automation; the sixth was abuse of driverless vehicle technology for terrorist attack.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090359882", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"], ["Safety Research", "SOCI", "3311"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"57199844042": {"Name": "Caldwell M.", "AuthorID": "57199844042", "AffiliationID": "60011022, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Compass Group, Computer Science, Ucl"}, "57195068529": {"Name": "Andrews J.T.A.", "AuthorID": "57195068529", "AffiliationID": "60011022, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Compass Group, Computer Science, Ucl"}, "57218707899": {"Name": "Tanay T.", "AuthorID": "57218707899", "AffiliationID": "60011022, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Compass Group, Computer Science, Ucl"}, "7102753156": {"Name": "Griffin L.D.", "AuthorID": "7102753156", "AffiliationID": "60011022, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Compass Group, Computer Science, Ucl"}}}
