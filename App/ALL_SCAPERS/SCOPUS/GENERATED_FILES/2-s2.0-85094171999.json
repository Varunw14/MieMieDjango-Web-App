Published by Cambridge University Press.The value of services for those with the 'At Risk Mental State for Psychosis' (ARMS) continues to be disputed. ARMS services have provided a valuable stimulus to academic research into the transition into psychosis. Furthermore, there is currently a welcome trend to transform such clinics into youth mental health services catering for the broader clientele of young people suffering from anxiety and depression, who already constitute the bulk of those seen at ARMS clinics. However, such services are never likely to make major inroads into preventing psychosis because they only reach a small proportion of those at risk. Evidence from medicine shows that avoiding exposure to factors which increase the risk of disease (e.g. poor nutrition, transmission of infection, tobacco smoking), produces greater public benefit than focussing efforts on individuals with, or about to develop, disease. We consider that the most productive approach for psychosis prevention is avoiding exposure to risk-increasing factors. The best-established risk factors for psychosis are obstetric events, childhood abuse, migration, city living, adverse life events and cannabis use. Some as city living, are likely proxies for an unknown causal factor(s) while preventing others such as childhood abuse is currently beyond our powers. The risk factor for psychosis which is most readily open to this approach is the use of cannabis. Therefore, as an initial step towards a strategy for universal primary prevention, we advocate public health campaigns to educate young people about the harms of regular use of high potency cannabis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["At-risk mental state", "pathways to care", "prevention", "psychosis", "schizophrenia", "transition"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85094171999", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57219715244": {"Name": "Murray R.M.", "AuthorID": "57219715244", "AffiliationID": "60017697", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Experimental Biomedicine and Clinical Neuroscience, University of Palermo"}, "57208765987": {"Name": "David A.S.", "AuthorID": "57208765987", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Mental Health, University College London"}, "56080212900": {"Name": "Ajnakina O.", "AuthorID": "56080212900", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60033387", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics and Health Informatics, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, University of London"}}}
