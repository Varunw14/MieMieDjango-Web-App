Tuberculosis (TB) is the major killer of people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) globally, with suboptimal diagnostics and management contributing to high case-fatality rates. Methods. A prospective cohort of patients with confirmed TB (Xpert MTB/RIF and/or Determine TB-LAM Ag positive) identified through screening HIV-positive inpatients with sputum and urine diagnostics in Malawi and South Africa (Rapid urine-based Screening for Tuberculosis to reduce AIDS Related Mortality in hospitalized Patients in Africa [STAMP] trial). Urine was tested prospectively (intervention) or retrospectively (standard of care arm). We defined baseline clinical phenotypes using hierarchical cluster analysis, and also used Cox regression analysis to identify associations with early mortality (\u226456 days). Results. Of 322 patients with TB confirmed between October 2015 and September 2018, 78.0% had \u22651 positive urine test. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage was 80.2% among those not newly diagnosed, but with median CD4 count 75 cells/\u00b5L and high HIV viral loads. Early mortality was 30.7% (99/322), despite near-universal prompt TB treatment. Older age, male sex, ART before admission, poor nutritional status, lower hemoglobin, and positive urine tests (TB-LAM and/or Xpert MTB/RIF) were associated with increased mortality in multivariate analyses. Cluster analysis (on baseline variables) defined 4 patient subgroups with early mortality ranging from 9.8% to 52.5%. Although unadjusted mortality was 9.3% lower in South Africa than Malawi, in adjusted models mortality was similar in both countries (hazard ratio, 0.9; P = .729). Conclusions. Mortality following prompt inpatient diagnosis of HIV-associated TB remained unacceptably high, even in South Africa. Intensified management strategies are urgently needed, for which prognostic indicators could potentially guide both development and subsequent use.", "AuthorKeywords": ["HIV", "Hospital inpatients", "Mortality", "TB", "Urine LAM"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85100217423", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"55786804400": {"Name": "Gupta-Wright A.", "AuthorID": "55786804400", "AffiliationID": "60072664, 60072678", "AffiliationName": "Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, University of Malawi College of Medicine"}, "35493200400": {"Name": "Fielding K.", "AuthorID": "35493200400", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "University of the Witwatersrand"}, "57203249048": {"Name": "Grint D.", "AuthorID": "57203249048", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7006905471": {"Name": "Lawn S.D.", "AuthorID": "7006905471", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research Department, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7006955721": {"Name": "Corbett E.L.", "AuthorID": "7006955721", "AffiliationID": "60072664, 60072678", "AffiliationName": "Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, University of Malawi College of Medicine"}, "56535819000": {"Name": "Peters J.A.", "AuthorID": "56535819000", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research Department, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "6602543006": {"Name": "Mwandumba H.C.", "AuthorID": "6602543006", "AffiliationID": "60020934", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Sciences, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"}, "57203950574": {"Name": "Chiume L.", "AuthorID": "57203950574", "AffiliationID": "60072664, 60072678", "AffiliationName": "Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, University of Malawi College of Medicine"}, "22136817500": {"Name": "Wilson D.", "AuthorID": "22136817500", "AffiliationID": "60010499, 60028197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Edendale Hospital, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "8650506700": {"Name": "van Oosterhout J.J.", "AuthorID": "8650506700", "AffiliationID": "60072664, 60072660", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Malawi"}, "57191657549": {"Name": "Alufandika-Moyo M.", "AuthorID": "57191657549", "AffiliationID": "60111561", "AffiliationName": "Dignitas International"}}}
