In order to simplify the source localization problem, many techniques introduce the assumption that current sources lie on the cortical surface. Another common assumption is that this current flow is orthogonal to the cortical surface, thereby approximating the orientation of cortical columns. However, it is not clear which cortical surface to use to define the current source locations, and normal vectors computed from a single cortical surface may not be the best approximation to the orientation of cortical columns. We compared three different surface location priors and five different approaches for estimating dipole vector orientation, both in simulations and visual and motor evoked MEG responses. We show that models with source locations on the white matter surface and using methods based on establishing correspondences between white matter and pial cortical surfaces dramatically outperform models with source locations on the pial or combined pial/white surfaces and which use methods based on the geometry of a single cortical surface in fitting evoked visual and motor responses. These methods can be easily implemented and adopted in most M/EEG analysis pipelines, with the potential to significantly improve source localization of evoked responses.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cortical columns", "Cortical surface", "Dipole orientation", "High precision MEG", "Source inversion"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083814348", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"15841520600": {"Name": "Bonaiuto J.J.", "AuthorID": "15841520600", "AffiliationID": "60023578, 60102126", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon"}, "55027268500": {"Name": "Afdideh F.", "AuthorID": "55027268500", "AffiliationID": "60108296, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Lyon Neuroscience Research Center, CRNL, Brain Dynamics and Cognition Team, INSERM U1028, CNRS UMR5292"}, "57216538344": {"Name": "Ferez M.", "AuthorID": "57216538344", "AffiliationID": "60108296, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Lyon Neuroscience Research Center, CRNL, Brain Dynamics and Cognition Team, INSERM U1028, CNRS UMR5292"}, "6602268913": {"Name": "Mattout J.", "AuthorID": "6602268913", "AffiliationID": "60108296, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Lyon Neuroscience Research Center, CRNL, Brain Dynamics and Cognition Team, INSERM U1028, CNRS UMR5292"}, "26649709300": {"Name": "Bonnefond M.", "AuthorID": "26649709300", "AffiliationID": "60108296, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Lyon Neuroscience Research Center, CRNL, Brain Dynamics and Cognition Team, INSERM U1028, CNRS UMR5292"}, "56538706700": {"Name": "Wagstyl K.", "AuthorID": "56538706700", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London (UCL)"}, "7202142345": {"Name": "Barnes G.R.", "AuthorID": "7202142345", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London (UCL)"}, "57218666851": {"Name": "Bestmann S.", "AuthorID": "57218666851", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Clinical and Movement Neuroscience, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London (UCL)"}}}
