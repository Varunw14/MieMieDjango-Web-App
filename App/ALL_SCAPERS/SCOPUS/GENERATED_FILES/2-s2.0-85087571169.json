Biotechnology and Bioengineering published by Wiley Periodicals LLCAdoptive T-cell therapy (ACT) has emerged as a promising new way to treat systemic cancers such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, the robustness and reproducibility of the manufacturing process remains a challenge. Here, a single-use 24-well microbioreactor (micro-Matrix) was assessed for its use as a high-throughput screening tool to investigate the effect and the interaction of different shaking speeds, dissolved oxygen (DO), and pH levels on the growth and differentiation of primary T cells in a perfusion-mimic process. The full factorial design allowed for the generation of predictive models, which were used to find optimal culture conditions. Agitation was shown to play a fundamental role in the proliferation of T cells. A shaking speed of 200 rpm drastically improved the final viable cell concentration (VCC), while the viability was maintained above 90% throughout the cultivation. VCCs reached a maximum of 9.22 \u00d7 106 cells/ml. The distribution of CD8+ central memory T cells (TCM), was found to be largely unaffected by the shaking speed. A clear interaction between pH and DO (p <.001) was established for the cell growth and the optimal culture conditions were identified for a combination of 200 rpm, 25% DO, and pH of 7.4. The combination of microbioreactor technology and Design of Experiment methodology provides a powerful tool to rapidly gain an understanding of the design space of the T-cell manufacturing process.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bioprocessing", "immunotherapy", "microbioreactor", "perfusion mimic", "T cell"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acute lymphoblastic leukemia", "Cell manufacturing", "Culture conditions", "Full factorial design", "High throughput screening tools", "Manufacturing process", "Predictive models", "Technology and designs"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087571169", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology", "IMMU", "2402"]], "AuthorData": {"57210894616": {"Name": "Amini A.", "AuthorID": "57210894616", "AffiliationID": "124735216", "AffiliationName": "Oribiotech Ltd."}, "57201730848": {"Name": "Wiegmann V.", "AuthorID": "57201730848", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, The Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57217735348": {"Name": "Patel H.", "AuthorID": "57217735348", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, The Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "10439111100": {"Name": "Veraitch F.", "AuthorID": "10439111100", "AffiliationID": "124735216", "AffiliationName": "Oribiotech Ltd."}, "6603502108": {"Name": "Baganz F.", "AuthorID": "6603502108", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, The Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
