All rights reserved.We present benchmark integrated and differential cross-sections for electron collisions with H2 using two different theoretical approaches, namely, the R-matrix and molecular convergent close-coupling. This is similar to comparative studies conducted on electron atom collisions for H, He and Mg. Electron impact excitation to the b3+u , a3+g , B1+u , c 3u, EF 1+g, C1u, e3+u , h3+g , B1+u and d 3u excited electronic states are considered. Calculations are presented in both the fixed nuclei and adiabatic nuclei approximations, where the latter is shown only for the b3+u state. Good agreement is found for all transitions presented.Where available, we compare with existing experimental and recommended data.", "AuthorKeywords": ["convergent close coupling", "differential cross sections", "electron molecule collisions", "electronic excitation", "R-matrix"], "IndexKeywords": ["Benchmark calculations", "Convergent close couplings", "Differential cross section", "Electron atom collisions", "Electron-impact excitation", "Electronic excitation", "Excited electronic state", "Theoretical approach"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086989548", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57193528398": {"Name": "Meltzer T.", "AuthorID": "57193528398", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57201812219": {"Name": "Tennyson J.", "AuthorID": "57201812219", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "53880108900": {"Name": "Ma\u0161\u00edn Z.", "AuthorID": "53880108900", "AffiliationID": "60016605", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Theoretical Physics, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics"}, "36652254500": {"Name": "Zammit M.C.", "AuthorID": "36652254500", "AffiliationID": "60006099, 60006164", "AffiliationName": "Theoretical Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory"}, "57195531806": {"Name": "Scarlett L.H.", "AuthorID": "57195531806", "AffiliationID": "60031226", "AffiliationName": "Curtin Institute for Computation and Department of Physics and Astronomy, Curtin University"}, "56230458100": {"Name": "Fursa D.V.", "AuthorID": "56230458100", "AffiliationID": "60031226", "AffiliationName": "Curtin Institute for Computation and Department of Physics and Astronomy, Curtin University"}, "7005142683": {"Name": "Bray I.", "AuthorID": "7005142683", "AffiliationID": "60031226", "AffiliationName": "Curtin Institute for Computation and Department of Physics and Astronomy, Curtin University"}}}
