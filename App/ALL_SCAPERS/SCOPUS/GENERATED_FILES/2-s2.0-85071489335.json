The European Union Innovative Medicines Initiative Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse-Central Nervous System (RADAR-CNS) program is an exemplary project with the requirements to support the collection of high-resolution data at scale; as such, the Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse (RADAR)-base platform is designed to meet these needs and additionally facilitate a new generation of mHealth projects in this nascent field. Objective: Wide-bandwidth networks, smartphone penetrance, and wearable sensors offer new possibilities for collecting near-real-time high-resolution datasets from large numbers of participants. The aim of this study was to build a platform that would cater for large-scale data collection for remote monitoring initiatives. Key criteria are around scalability, extensibility, security, and privacy. Methods: RADAR-base is developed as a modular application; the backend is built on a backbone of the highly successful Confluent/Apache Kafka framework for streaming data. To facilitate scaling and ease of deployment, we use Docker containers to package the components of the platform. RADAR-base provides 2 main mobile apps for data collection, a Passive App and an Active App. Other third-Party Apps and sensors are easily integrated into the platform. Management user interfaces to support data collection and enrolment are also provided. Results: General principles of the platform components and design of RADAR-base are presented here, with examples of the types of data currently being collected from devices used in RADAR-CNS projects: Multiple Sclerosis, Epilepsy, and Depression cohorts. Conclusions: RADAR-base is a fully functional, remote data collection platform built around Confluent/Apache Kafka and provides off-the-shelf components for projects interested in collecting mHealth datasets at scale.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Mental health", "Mobile applications", "Remote sensing technology", "Telemedicine"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071489335", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"57205028192": {"Name": "Ranjan Y.", "AuthorID": "57205028192", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), Department of Biostatistics and Health Informatics, King's College London"}, "57208873135": {"Name": "Rashid Z.", "AuthorID": "57208873135", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), Department of Biostatistics and Health Informatics, King's College London"}, "57205023094": {"Name": "Stewart C.", "AuthorID": "57205023094", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), Department of Biostatistics and Health Informatics, King's College London"}, "57210795333": {"Name": "Conde P.", "AuthorID": "57210795333", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), Department of Biostatistics and Health Informatics, King's College London"}, "8931612400": {"Name": "Dobson R.", "AuthorID": "8931612400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}, "35766461900": {"Name": "Folarin A.", "AuthorID": "35766461900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}, "36766824700": {"Name": "Begale M.", "AuthorID": "36766824700", "AffiliationID": "122494144", "AffiliationName": "Vibrent Health"}, "57199857471": {"Name": "Verbeeck D.", "AuthorID": "57199857471", "AffiliationID": "60068574", "AffiliationName": "Janssen Pharmaceutica NV"}, "57210805593": {"Name": "Boettcher S.", "AuthorID": "57210805593", "AffiliationID": "60024805", "AffiliationName": "Epilepsy Center, Department of Neurosurgery, University of Hospital Freiburg"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
