When asked to reflect on questions concerning the Philosophy of Education in a New Key in May 2020, it was unsurprising that the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on society and on education were foremost in our minds. We wanted to consider important philosophical and educational questions raised by the pandemic, while acknowledging that, first and foremost, it is a human tragedy. With nearly a million deaths reported worldwide to date, and with everyone effected in one way or another by Covid-19, there is a degree of discomfort, and a responsibility to be sensitive, in reflecting and writing about it academically. Members of this \u2018Covid Collective\u2019 come from various countries, with perspectives from Great Britain and Ireland well represented, and we see academic practice as a globally connected enterprise, especially since the digital revolution in academic publishing. The concerns raised in this article relate to but move beyond Covid-19, reflecting the impact of neoliberalism [and other political developments] on geopolitics with educational concerns as central to our focus.", "AuthorKeywords": ["collective writing", "COVID-19", "geopolitics", "neoliberalism", "philosophy of education"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095722782", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["History and Philosophy of Science", "ARTS", "1207"]], "AuthorData": {"57220470955": {"Name": "Orchard J.", "AuthorID": "57220470955", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Education, University of Bristol"}, "57195598151": {"Name": "Gaydon P.", "AuthorID": "57195598151", "AffiliationID": "100556145", "AffiliationName": "Department of Theology and Philosophy, St Paul\u2019s School"}, "7404142231": {"Name": "Williams K.", "AuthorID": "7404142231", "AffiliationID": "60025059", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, Dublin City University"}, "57219853664": {"Name": "Bennett P.", "AuthorID": "57219853664", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Longitudinal Studies, UCL Institute of Education"}, "57189990342": {"Name": "D\u2019Olimpio L.", "AuthorID": "57189990342", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Education, University of Birmingham"}, "56625852800": {"Name": "\u00c7elik R.", "AuthorID": "56625852800", "AffiliationID": "60012603", "AffiliationName": "School of Education, Ankara University"}, "57206262390": {"Name": "Shah Q.", "AuthorID": "57206262390", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, Practice and Society, UCL Institute of Education"}, "57203671809": {"Name": "Suissa J.", "AuthorID": "57203671809", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, Practice and Society, UCL Institute of Education"}, "57191196199": {"Name": "Neusiedl C.", "AuthorID": "57191196199", "AffiliationID": "125336038", "AffiliationName": "Project DEFY"}, "35325340800": {"Name": "Peters M.A.", "AuthorID": "35325340800", "AffiliationID": "60023237", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Education, Beijing Normal University"}, "55680983500": {"Name": "Tesar M.", "AuthorID": "55680983500", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Education and Social Work, The University of Auckland"}}}
