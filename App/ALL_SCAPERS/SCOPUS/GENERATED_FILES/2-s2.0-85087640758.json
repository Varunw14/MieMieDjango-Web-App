The NCDS (1958 British birth cohort) follows those born in Britain in a single week in March 1958 (n=18,558); and the ONS Longitudinal Study (LS) contains linked census data and life events for a 1% sample of the population of England and Wales (> 1 million records; allowing for sub-samples by age, ethnicity, or other socio-demographic factors). Common country-and age-matched socio-demographic variables were extracted from the closest corresponding time-points, NCDS 55-year survey in 2013 (n=8107) and LS respondents aged 55 in 2011 (n=7052). Longitudinal associations between socio-demographic exposures (from the NCDS 46-survey in 2004 and LS respondents aged 45 in 2001) and long-term limiting illness (from NCDS 2013 and LS respondents 2011, aged 55) were assessed using logistic regression. The NCDS 55-year sample had similar characteristics to LS respondents aged 55 for sex and marital status, but the NCDS sample had lower levels of long-term limiting illness (19.7% vs 22.8%), non-white ethnicity (2.1% vs 11.7%) and living in South England (46.9% vs 50.1%), and higher levels of full-time employment (61.2% vs 55.2%), working in professional/higher managerial occupations (35.7% vs 29.2%), and living with a spouse (69.1% vs 64.9%), all p<0.001. Nevertheless, longitudinal associations between socio-demographic exposures and long-term limiting illness were similar in the NCDS and LS samples (all tests of between-study heterogeneity in mutually adjusted models p>0.09) suggesting these NCDS findings are largely generalisable to the population of England and Wales.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attrition", "Census", "Cohort study", "Loss to follow-up", "Representativeness"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087640758", "SubjectAreas": [["Life-span and Life-course Studies", "SOCI", "3319"]], "AuthorData": {"57188843161": {"Name": "Archer G.", "AuthorID": "57188843161", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "University College London, King\u2019s College London"}, "57209362498": {"Name": "Xun W.W.", "AuthorID": "57209362498", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6504330140": {"Name": "Stuchbury R.", "AuthorID": "6504330140", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "41461757300": {"Name": "Nicholas O.", "AuthorID": "41461757300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6601962405": {"Name": "Shelton N.", "AuthorID": "6601962405", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
