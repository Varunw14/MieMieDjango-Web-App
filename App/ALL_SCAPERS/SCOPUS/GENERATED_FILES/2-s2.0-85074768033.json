Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Background: Dried bloodspots are easy to collect and to transport to assess various metabolites, such as amino acids. Dried bloodspots are routinely used for diagnosis and monitoring of some inherited metabolic diseases. Methods: Measurement of amino acids from dried blood spots by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Results: We describe a novel rapid method to measure underivatised urea cycle related amino acids. Application of this method enabled accurate monitoring of these amino acids to assess the efficacy of therapies in argininosuccinate lyase deficient mice and monitoring of these metabolites in patients with urea cycle defects. Conclusion: Measuring urea cycle related amino acids in urea cycle defects from dried blood spots is a reliable tool in animal research and will be of benefit in the clinic, facilitating optimisation of protein-restricted diet and preventing amino acid deprivation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amino acids", "Argininosuccinate lyase", "Dried blood spots", "Tandem mass spectrometry", "Urea cycle"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074768033", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"26430341400": {"Name": "Baruteau J.", "AuthorID": "26430341400", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Health Research Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre"}, "57211660266": {"Name": "Khalil Y.", "AuthorID": "57211660266", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "6602308059": {"Name": "Gissen P.", "AuthorID": "6602308059", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "57202556029": {"Name": "Mills P.", "AuthorID": "57202556029", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7003698645": {"Name": "Waddington S.N.", "AuthorID": "7003698645", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "Wits/SAMRC Antiviral Gene Therapy Research Unit, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand"}, "7005299518": {"Name": "Grunewald S.", "AuthorID": "7005299518", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Metabolic Medicine Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57205589935": {"Name": "Chakrapani A.", "AuthorID": "57205589935", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Metabolic Medicine Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7202006123": {"Name": "Cleary M.", "AuthorID": "7202006123", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Metabolic Medicine Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36503791000": {"Name": "Davison J.", "AuthorID": "36503791000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Metabolic Medicine Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24066333000": {"Name": "Footitt E.", "AuthorID": "24066333000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Metabolic Medicine Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57220228821": {"Name": "Zancolli M.", "AuthorID": "57220228821", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Health Research Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre"}}}
