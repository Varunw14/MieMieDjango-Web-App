Design Cross-sectional self-administered survey. Setting All children and young people eating disorder services (CYP EDS) in England during a national training programme. Participants 44 CAED psychiatrists practising in CYP EDS in England. Primary and secondary outcome measures CAED psychiatrists completed a questionnaire regarding the pattern of psychopharmacological care in AN that they provide and the medication treatment pattern at their CYP EDS. Secondary outcome measures included the process of continuing pharmacotherapy from secondary care to primary care. Results Of the 77 CYP EDS representing every team in England, 44 teams represented by a CAED psychiatrist responded, despite 13 having no psychiatrists in post at the time of the study (response rate 69%). Most (40%) respondents estimated that <10% of patients with AN were prescribed psychotropic medications. Olanzapine was reported as the most commonly prescribed medication for AN by 38% of the respondents, followed by fluoxetine (29%) and sertraline (10%). The most common minimum olanzapine initiation dose in this study was at 2.5 mg/day for a duration of 2-4 weeks, reaching a maximum dose of 5 mg/day. Most (68%) reviewed medications every week (30%) or every 2 weeks (38%). Over 50% of the respondents reported continuation of olanzapine prescribing within the CYP EDS teams. Conclusions This nationally representative survey showed that despite a lack of evidence, psychotropic medications are commonly prescribed to a minority of patients, most frequently, olanzapine. Further evidence is needed on which patients may potentially benefit from pharmacotherapy as an adjunct to psychological interventions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Child & adolescent psychiatry", "Eating disorders", "EPIDEMIOLOGY"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anorexia Nervosa", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Drug Prescriptions", "Humans", "Practice Patterns, Physicians'", "Psychiatry", "Psychotropic Drugs", "Self Report"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072580649", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57204778402": {"Name": "Beykloo M.Y.", "AuthorID": "57204778402", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Practice and Policy, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "54384760200": {"Name": "Brauer R.", "AuthorID": "54384760200", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Practice and Policy, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57217659841": {"Name": "Mills E.", "AuthorID": "57217659841", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Practice and Policy, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7102513915": {"Name": "Wong I.C.K.", "AuthorID": "7102513915", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, University of Hong Kong"}, "7202972172": {"Name": "Nicholls D.", "AuthorID": "7202972172", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Department of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London"}, "8231741300": {"Name": "Simic M.", "AuthorID": "8231741300", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "Michael Rutter Centre, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
