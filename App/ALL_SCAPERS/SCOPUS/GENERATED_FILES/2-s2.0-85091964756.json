Such open data can shed light on the causes of disease and effects of treatment, including adverse reactions side-effects of treatments, while also facilitating analyses tailored to an individual\u2019s characteristics, known as personalized or \u201cstratified medicine.\u201d Developments, such as crowdsourcing, participatory surveillance, and individuals pledging to become \u201cdata donors\u201d and the \u201cquantified self\u201d movement (where citizens share data through mobile device-connected technologies), have great potential to contribute to our knowledge of disease, improving diagnostics, and delivery of \u00adhealthcare and treatment. There is not only a great potential but also major concerns over privacy, confidentiality, and control of data about individuals once it is shared. Issues, such as user trust, data privacy, transparency over the control of data ownership, and the implications of data analytics for personal privacy with potentially intrusive inferences, are becoming increasingly scrutinized at national and international levels. This can be seen in the recent backlash over the proposed implementation of care.data, which enables individuals\u2019 NHS data to be linked, retained, and shared for other uses, such as research and, more controversially, with businesses for commercial exploitation. By way of contrast, through increasing popularity of social media, GPS-enabled mobile apps and tracking/wearable devices, the IT industry and MedTech giants are pursuing new projects without clear public and policy discussion about ownership and responsibility for user-generated data. In the absence of transparent regulation, this paper addresses the opportunities of Big Data in healthcare together with issues of responsibility and accountability. It also aims to pave the way for public policy to support a balanced agenda that safeguards personal information while enabling the use of data to improve public health.", "AuthorKeywords": ["data ownership", "data policy", "healthcare EPR", "open data", "privacy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091964756", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"6506790018": {"Name": "Kostkova P.", "AuthorID": "6506790018", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London (UCL)"}, "7003530277": {"Name": "Sasse A.", "AuthorID": "7003530277", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London (UCL)"}, "57219268711": {"Name": "Brewer H.", "AuthorID": "57219268711", "AffiliationID": "112936115", "AffiliationName": "Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology"}, "7003334937": {"Name": "de Lusignan S.", "AuthorID": "7003334937", "AffiliationID": "60021097, 60113753", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Surrey, Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre"}, "57203032777": {"Name": "Goldacre B.", "AuthorID": "57203032777", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Population Health Sciences, University College London (UCL)"}, "16021923800": {"Name": "Fottrell E.", "AuthorID": "16021923800", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}, "57219267044": {"Name": "Hart G.", "AuthorID": "57219267044", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}, "20433934100": {"Name": "Koczan P.", "AuthorID": "20433934100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Partners (UCLP)"}, "57220661311": {"Name": "Knight P.", "AuthorID": "57220661311", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Health"}, "57219270166": {"Name": "Marsolier C.", "AuthorID": "57219270166", "AffiliationID": "124030505", "AffiliationName": "Cisco Consulting Services, Life Sciences, Health and Care"}, "7006090296": {"Name": "McKendry R.A.", "AuthorID": "7006090296", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "The London Centre for Nanotechnology and Division of Medicine, University College London (UCL)"}, "57219268502": {"Name": "Ross E.", "AuthorID": "57219268502", "AffiliationID": "60020875", "AffiliationName": "Chatham House Centre on Global Health Security"}, "57220716389": {"Name": "Sullivan R.", "AuthorID": "57220716389", "AffiliationID": "60113753", "AffiliationName": "Health Informatics Group, Royal College of General Practitioners"}, "55618984800": {"Name": "Chaytor S.", "AuthorID": "55618984800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Public Policy, UCL"}, "36785569300": {"Name": "Stevenson O.", "AuthorID": "36785569300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Public Policy, UCL"}, "57189594874": {"Name": "Velho R.", "AuthorID": "57189594874", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Science and Technology Studies, UCL"}, "57213022616": {"Name": "Tooke J.", "AuthorID": "57213022616", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Life and Medical Sciences, UCL"}}}
