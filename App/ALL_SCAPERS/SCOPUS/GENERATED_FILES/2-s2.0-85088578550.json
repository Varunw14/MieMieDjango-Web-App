A popular reconstruction approach called discrete tomography confines the atom locations to a coarse spatial grid, which is inspired by the physical a priori knowledge that atoms in a crystalline solid tend to form regular lattices. Although this constraint has proven to be powerful for solving this very under-determined inverse problem in many cases, its key limitation is that, in practice, defects may occur that cause atoms to deviate from regular lattice positions. Here we propose a grid-free discrete tomography algorithm that allows for continuous deviations of the atom locations similar to super-resolution approaches for microscopy. The new formulation allows us to define atomic interaction potentials explicitly, which results in a both meaningful and powerful incorporation of the available physical a priori knowledge about the crystal\u2019s properties. In computational experiments, we compare the proposed grid-free method to established grid-based approaches and show that our approach can indeed recover the atom positions more accurately for common lattice defects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Crystallographic defects", "Discrete tomography", "Electron tomography", "Mathematical super-resolution", "Molecular dynamics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Atomic interactions", "Atomic resolution", "Computational experiment", "Crystalline solids", "Discrete tomography", "Electron microscopy images", "Grid-based approach", "Under-determined"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088578550", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57218281604": {"Name": "Ganguly P.S.", "AuthorID": "57218281604", "AffiliationID": "60019816", "AffiliationName": "The Mathematical Institute, Leiden University"}, "52364146500": {"Name": "Lucka F.", "AuthorID": "52364146500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "55879451400": {"Name": "Batenburg K.J.", "AuthorID": "55879451400", "AffiliationID": "60019816", "AffiliationName": "The Mathematical Institute, Leiden University"}, "8721307200": {"Name": "Hupkes H.J.", "AuthorID": "8721307200", "AffiliationID": "60019816", "AffiliationName": "The Mathematical Institute, Leiden University"}}}
