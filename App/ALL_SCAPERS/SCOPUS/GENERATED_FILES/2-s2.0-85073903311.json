Many different robotic architectures have been proposed over recent years, each with benefits and shortfalls. In this work, we propose a Polyurethane Foam depositing system, which can be applied to any such platform and increase its ability to overcome obstacles significantly. The system proposed is inexpensive, and the way in which it overcomes obstacles allows very simple control systems for autonomy. The deposited foam has a potential expansion ratio of over 33 \u00d7 its constituent parts and a final compressive strength exceeding 2 MPa, final mechanical properties can be tuned on board. The system has been implemented on a two-tracked rover and its autonomous responses tested against significant objects and chasms. The results show that the amount of foam deposited can be well controlled and multiple layers can be stacked on top of each other to significantly increase altitude.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Disaster scenario", "Overcoming obstacles", "Polyurethane Foam", "Robotics", "Search and rescue"], "IndexKeywords": ["Autonomous response", "Disaster scenario", "Irregular terrain", "Overcoming obstacles", "Polyurethane Foam", "Robotic architectures", "Robotic platforms", "Search and rescue"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073903311", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"56312420000": {"Name": "Burns A.", "AuthorID": "56312420000", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "University of Liverpool"}, "55804942600": {"Name": "Fichera S.", "AuthorID": "55804942600", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "University of Liverpool"}, "7103195033": {"Name": "Paoletti P.", "AuthorID": "7103195033", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "University of Liverpool"}}}
