The role of alcohol-induced loss of consciousness is uncertain. Objective: To examine the risk of future dementia associated with overall alcohol consumption and alcohol-induced loss of consciousness in a population of current drinkers. Design, Setting, and Participants: Seven cohort studies from the UK, France, Sweden, and Finland (IPD-Work consortium) including 131\u202f415 participants were examined. At baseline (1986-2012), participants were aged 18 to 77 years, reported alcohol consumption, and were free of diagnosed dementia. Dementia was examined during a mean follow-up of 14.4 years (range, 12.3-30.1). Data analysis was conducted from November 17, 2019, to May 23, 2020. Exposures: Self-reported overall consumption and loss of consciousness due to alcohol consumption were assessed at baseline. Two thresholds were used to define heavy overall consumption: greater than 14 units (U) (UK definition) and greater than 21 U (US definition) per week. Main Outcomes and Measures: Dementia and alcohol-related disorders to 2016 were ascertained from linked electronic health records. Results: Of the 131\u202f415 participants (mean [SD] age, 43.0 [10.4] years; 80\u202f344 [61.1%] women), 1081 individuals (0.8%) developed dementia. After adjustment for potential confounders, the hazard ratio (HR) was 1.16 (95% CI, 0.98-1.37) for consuming greater than 14 vs 1 to 14 U of alcohol per week and 1.22 (95% CI, 1.01-1.48) for greater than 21 vs 1 to 21 U/wk. Of the 96\u202f591 participants with data on loss of consciousness, 10\u202f004 individuals (10.4%) reported having lost consciousness due to alcohol consumption in the past 12 months. The association between loss of consciousness and dementia was observed in men (HR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.77-4.63) and women (HR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.34-3.25) during the first 10 years of follow-up (HR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.78-4.15), after excluding the first 10 years of follow-up (HR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.16-2.99), and for early-onset (<65 y: HR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.46-3.34) and late-onset (\u226565 y: HR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.38-3.66) dementia, Alzheimer disease (HR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.28-3.07), and dementia with features of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (HR, 4.18; 95% CI, 1.86-9.37). The association with dementia was not explained by 14 other alcohol-related conditions. With moderate drinkers (1-14 U/wk) who had not lost consciousness as the reference group, the HR for dementia was twice as high in participants who reported having lost consciousness, whether their mean weekly consumption was moderate (HR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.42-3.37) or heavy (HR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.57-3.54). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this study suggest that alcohol-induced loss of consciousness, irrespective of overall alcohol consumption, is associated with a subsequent increase in the risk of dementia.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85090727143", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57218590862": {"Name": "Kivim\u00e4ki M.", "AuthorID": "57218590862", "AffiliationID": "60002952, 60029080", "AffiliationName": "Clinicum, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki"}, "9734197200": {"Name": "Singh-Manoux A.", "AuthorID": "9734197200", "AffiliationID": "60112042, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Epidemiology of Ageing and Neurodegenerative Diseases, INSERM U1153, Universit\u00e9 de Paris"}, "7003988354": {"Name": "Batty G.D.", "AuthorID": "7003988354", "AffiliationID": "60013402", "AffiliationName": "Oregon State University School of Biological and Population Health Sciences"}, "55045633300": {"Name": "Ferrie J.E.", "AuthorID": "55045633300", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Medical School, Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "16835278700": {"Name": "Nyberg S.T.", "AuthorID": "16835278700", "AffiliationID": "60010493", "AffiliationName": "Finnish Institute of Occupational Health"}, "53881929900": {"Name": "Sipil\u00e4 P.N.", "AuthorID": "53881929900", "AffiliationID": "60002952, 60029080", "AffiliationName": "Clinicum, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki"}, "57190136283": {"Name": "Lindbohm J.V.", "AuthorID": "57190136283", "AffiliationID": "60002952, 60029080", "AffiliationName": "Clinicum, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki"}, "7003843149": {"Name": "Pentti J.", "AuthorID": "7003843149", "AffiliationID": "60010493", "AffiliationName": "Finnish Institute of Occupational Health"}, "57202566229": {"Name": "Strandberg T.", "AuthorID": "57202566229", "AffiliationID": "60012954", "AffiliationName": "Center for Life Course Health Research, University of Oulu"}, "24339408800": {"Name": "Sabia S.", "AuthorID": "24339408800", "AffiliationID": "60112042, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Epidemiology of Ageing and Neurodegenerative Diseases, INSERM U1153, Universit\u00e9 de Paris"}, "56107100900": {"Name": "Sommerlad A.", "AuthorID": "56107100900", "AffiliationID": "60161451", "AffiliationName": "Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7006347341": {"Name": "Livingston G.", "AuthorID": "7006347341", "AffiliationID": "60161451", "AffiliationName": "Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust"}, "39761304200": {"Name": "Floud S.", "AuthorID": "39761304200", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford"}, "16030844400": {"Name": "Jokela M.", "AuthorID": "16030844400", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Logopedics, University of Helsinki"}, "7003922524": {"Name": "Vahtera J.", "AuthorID": "7003922524", "AffiliationID": "60025765, 60006876", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Population Health Research, Turku University Hospital, University of Turku"}, "7003565265": {"Name": "Suominen S.B.", "AuthorID": "7003565265", "AffiliationID": "60010345", "AffiliationName": "University of Sk\u00f6vde School of Health and Education"}, "57218548948": {"Name": "Beydoun M.A.", "AuthorID": "57218548948", "AffiliationID": "60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Epidemiology and Population Sciences, Intramural Research Program, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health"}, "23980401200": {"Name": "Koskinen A.", "AuthorID": "23980401200", "AffiliationID": "60010493", "AffiliationName": "Finnish Institute of Occupational Health"}, "10640968900": {"Name": "V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen A.", "AuthorID": "10640968900", "AffiliationID": "60010493", "AffiliationName": "Finnish Institute of Occupational Health"}, "7404395870": {"Name": "Goldberg M.", "AuthorID": "7404395870", "AffiliationID": "60106188", "AffiliationName": "Population-Based Epidemiological Cohorts Unit, INSERM UMS 011"}, "7005528594": {"Name": "Zins M.", "AuthorID": "7005528594", "AffiliationID": "60106188", "AffiliationName": "Population-Based Epidemiological Cohorts Unit, INSERM UMS 011"}, "7007140234": {"Name": "Alfredsson L.", "AuthorID": "7007140234", "AffiliationID": "116269156", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Region Stockholm"}, "57216110571": {"Name": "Westerholm P.J.M.", "AuthorID": "57216110571", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University"}, "55162047000": {"Name": "Knutsson A.", "AuthorID": "55162047000", "AffiliationID": "60106597", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, Mid Sweden University"}}}
