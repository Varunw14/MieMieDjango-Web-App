We compared S-ICD patients with TV-ICD patients on QoL, depression, and anxiety up to 12 months\u2019 follow-up. Methods: A matched cohort of S-ICD (N = 167) and TV-ICD patients (N = 167) completed measures on QoL, depression, anxiety, and personality at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months post implant. Data were analyzed using multivariable modeling with repeated measures. Results: In adjusted analyses, we found no statistically significant differences between cohorts on physical and mental QoL and depression (all Ps >.05), while S-ICD patients reported lower anxiety than TV-ICD patients (P = 0.0007). Both cohorts experienced improvements in physical and mental QoL and symptoms of depression and anxiety over time (all Ps <.001), primarily between implant and 3 months. These improvements were similar for both cohorts with respect to physical and mental QoL and anxiety (Ps >.05), while S-ICD patients experienced greater reductions in depressive symptoms (P =.0317). Conclusion: The QoL and depression levels were similar in patients with an S-ICD and a TV-ICD up to 12 months\u2019 follow-up, while S-ICD patients reported lower anxiety levels and a greater reduction in depression over time as compared to TV-ICD patients. This knowledge may be important for patients and clinicians, if the indication for implantation allows both the S-ICD and the TV-ICD, making a choice possible.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anxiety", "depression", "implantable cardioverter defibrillator", "quality of life"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85075311914", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57215112185": {"Name": "Pedersen S.S.", "AuthorID": "57215112185", "AffiliationID": "60019160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Southern Denmark"}, "57210706856": {"Name": "Johansen J.B.", "AuthorID": "57210706856", "AffiliationID": "60015591", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Odense University Hospital"}, "56163295100": {"Name": "Carter N.", "AuthorID": "56163295100", "AffiliationID": "60031281", "AffiliationName": "Boston Scientific Corporation"}, "7101663676": {"Name": "Barr C.", "AuthorID": "7101663676", "AffiliationID": "60026570", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Russels Hall Hospital"}, "7006805807": {"Name": "Scholten M.", "AuthorID": "7006805807", "AffiliationID": "60005675", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Thorax Center Twente, Medisch Spectrum Twente"}, "6603130488": {"Name": "Lambiase P.D.", "AuthorID": "6603130488", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60004093", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London & Barts Heart Centre"}, "7004921270": {"Name": "Boersma L.", "AuthorID": "7004921270", "AffiliationID": "60025865", "AffiliationName": "St Antonius Ziekenhuis"}, "6603638449": {"Name": "Theuns D.A.M.J.", "AuthorID": "6603638449", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Erasmus Medical Center"}}}
