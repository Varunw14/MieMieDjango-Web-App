However, the variety of alternatives makes it difficult to choose which condition to employ, and how to compose them when using objects specified by different conditions. In this work, we propose a uniform alternative in the form of Hoare logic, which can explicitly capture - in the auxiliary state - the interference of environment threads. We demonstrate the expressiveness of our method by verifying a number of concurrent objects and their clients, which have so far been specified only by non-standard conditions of concurrency-aware linearizability, quiescent, and quantitative quiescent consistency. We report on the implementation of the ideas in an existing Coq-based tool, providing the first mechanized proofs for all the examples in the paper.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Concurrency", "counting networks", "Hoare logic", "linearizability", "mechanized proofs", "quies- cent consistency"], "IndexKeywords": ["Concurrent objects", "Correctness conditions", "Hoare Logic", "Linearizability", "Mechanized proofs", "Standard conditions", "Standard specifications"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85084550691", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"35114020100": {"Name": "Sergey I.", "AuthorID": "35114020100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "15047125400": {"Name": "Nanevski A.", "AuthorID": "15047125400", "AffiliationID": "60121727", "AffiliationName": "IMDEA Software Institute"}, "8558971000": {"Name": "Banerjee A.", "AuthorID": "8558971000", "AffiliationID": "60121727", "AffiliationName": "IMDEA Software Institute"}, "55918827000": {"Name": "Delbianco G.A.", "AuthorID": "55918827000", "AffiliationID": "60121727", "AffiliationName": "IMDEA Software Institute"}}}
