Participants reported their daily news consumption activities over a period of two weeks through a snippet-based diary and experience sampling study, followed by semi-structured exit interviews. Wunderlist, a commercially available task management application and note-taking software, was appropriated for data collection. Findings highlighted a range of contextual factors that are not accounted for in current \u2018contextually-aware\u2019 news delivery technologies, and could be developed to better adapt such technologies in the future. These contextual factors were segmented to four areas: triggers, positive/conducive factors, negative/distracting factors and barriers to use.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Context awareness", "Contextual factors", "Mobile", "News consumption", "Snippet technique"], "IndexKeywords": ["Context- awareness", "Contextual factors", "Mobile", "News consumption", "Snippet technique"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85072952492", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57211206585": {"Name": "Cohen Y.", "AuthorID": "57211206585", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Interaction Centre, UCL"}, "55515206300": {"Name": "Constantinides M.", "AuthorID": "55515206300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, UCL"}, "57191485447": {"Name": "Marshall P.", "AuthorID": "57191485447", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Bristol"}}}
