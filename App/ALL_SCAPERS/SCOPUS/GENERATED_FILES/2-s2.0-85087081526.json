Currently, there is no effective treatment available. COL6-CMDs are caused by recessive or dominant mutations in one of the three genes encoding for the \u03b1 chains of collagen type VI (COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3). One of the most common mutations in COL6-CMD patients is a de novo deep intronic c.930+189C > T mutation in COL6A1 gene. This mutation creates a cryptic donor splice site and induces incorporation of a novel in-frame pseudo-exon in the mature transcripts. In this study, we systematically evaluated the splice switching approach using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to correct this mutation. Fifteen ASOs were designed using the RNA-tiling approach to target the misspliced pseudo-exon and its flanking sequences. The efficiency of ASOs was evaluated at RNA, protein, and structural levels in skin fibroblasts established from four patients carrying the c.930+189C > T mutation. We identified two additional lead ASO candidates that efficiently induce pseudo-exon exclusion from the mature transcripts, thus allowing for the restoration of a functional collagen VI microfibrillar matrix. Our findings provide further evidence for ASO exon skipping as a therapeutic approach for COL6-CMD patients carrying this common intronic mutation.\u00a9 2020 The Author(s)COL6-related congenital muscular dystrophies are caused by mutations in COL6A genes leading to the reduction of collagen VI protein in extracellular matrix. Zhou and colleagues report an exon-skipping antisense approach to successfully correct a common deep intronic mutation and restore functional collagen VI protein in cultured skin fibroblasts from patients.
