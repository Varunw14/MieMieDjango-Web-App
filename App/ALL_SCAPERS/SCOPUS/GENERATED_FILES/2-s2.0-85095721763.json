All rights reserved.Albanerpetontids are tiny, enigmatic fossil amphibians with a distinctive suite of characteristics, including scales and specialized jaw and neck joints. Here we describe a new genus and species of albanerpetontid, represented by fully articulated and three-dimensional specimens preserved in amber. These specimens preserve skeletal and soft tissues, including an elongated median hyoid element, the tip of which remains embedded in a distal tongue pad. This arrangement is very similar to the long, rapidly projecting tongue of chameleons. Our results thus suggest that albanerpetontids were sit-and-wait ballistic tongue feeders, extending the record of this specialized feeding mode by around 100 million years.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amber", "Amphibians", "Animals", "Extinction, Biological", "Fossils", "Myanmar", "Phylogeny", "Skull"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85095721763", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"6602179307": {"Name": "Daza J.D.", "AuthorID": "6602179307", "AffiliationID": "60025157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, Sam Houston State University"}, "36509326300": {"Name": "Stanley E.L.", "AuthorID": "36509326300", "AffiliationID": "60027033", "AffiliationName": "Department of Herpetology, Florida Museum of Natural History"}, "15046423500": {"Name": "Bolet A.", "AuthorID": "15046423500", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "7202698988": {"Name": "Bauer A.M.", "AuthorID": "7202698988", "AffiliationID": "60000009", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Center for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Stewardship, Villanova University"}, "6504102843": {"Name": "Salvador Arias J.", "AuthorID": "6504102843", "AffiliationID": "60004518", "AffiliationName": "Unidad Ejecutora Lillo, CONICET - FML"}, "57219703063": {"Name": "\u010cer\u0148ansk\u00fd A.", "AuthorID": "57219703063", "AffiliationID": "60001987", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ecology, Laboratory of Evolutionary Biology, Faculty of Natural Sciences, Comenius University in Bratislava"}, "57209387362": {"Name": "Bevitt J.J.", "AuthorID": "57209387362", "AffiliationID": "60023748", "AffiliationName": "Australian Centre for Neutron Scattering, Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation"}, "24345759800": {"Name": "Wagner P.", "AuthorID": "24345759800", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Research and Conservation, Allwetterzoo M\u00fcnster"}, "57203513332": {"Name": "Evans S.E.", "AuthorID": "57203513332", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}}}
