If bisacodyl does not induce high-amplitude propagating contractions (HAPCs), this can be an indication for surgical intervention. A detailed characterization of the colonic response to intraluminal bisacodyl in children with constipation may help to inform clinical interpretation of colonic manometry studies. Methods: Studies were performed in five pediatric hospitals. Analysis included identification of HAPCs, reporting HAPCs characteristics, and an area under the curve (AUC) analysis. Comparisons were performed between hospitals, catheter type, placement techniques, and site of bisacodyl infusion. Results: One hundred and sixty-five children were included (median age 10, range 1-17 years; n = 96 girls). One thousand eight hundred and ninety-three HAPCs were identified in 154 children (12.3 \u00b1 8.8 HAPCs per child, 0.32 \u00b1 0.21 HAPCs per min; amplitude 113.6 \u00b1 31.5 mm Hg; velocity 8.6 \u00b1 3.8 mm/s, propagation length 368 \u00b1 175 mm). The mean time to first HAPC following bisacodyl was 553 \u00b1 669 s. Prior to the first HAPC, there was no change in AUC when comparing pre- vs post-bisacodyl (Z = \u22120.53, P =.60). The majority of HAPCs terminated in a synchronous pressurization in the rectosigmoid. Defecation was associated with HAPCs (\u03c72(1)=7.04, P <.01). Site of bisacodyl administration, catheter type, and hospital location did not alter the response. Conclusions and Inferences: Intraluminal bisacodyl induced HAPCs in 93% of children with treatment-refractory constipation. The bisacodyl response is characterized by \u22651 HAPC within 12 minutes of infusion. The majority of HAPCs terminate in a synchronous pressurization in the rectosigmoid. Optimal clinical management based upon colonic manometry findings is yet to be determined.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bisacodyl", "children", "constipation", "manometry"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083240538", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Endocrine and Autonomic Systems", "NEUR", "2807"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"57203863390": {"Name": "Heitmann P.T.", "AuthorID": "57203863390", "AffiliationID": "60020828", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine and Public Health & Centre for Neuroscience, Flinders University"}, "16481598500": {"Name": "Wiklendt L.", "AuthorID": "16481598500", "AffiliationID": "60020828", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine and Public Health & Centre for Neuroscience, Flinders University"}, "7003694047": {"Name": "Wattchow D.A.", "AuthorID": "7003694047", "AffiliationID": "60020828", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine and Public Health & Centre for Neuroscience, Flinders University"}, "7101703862": {"Name": "Brookes S.J.H.", "AuthorID": "7101703862", "AffiliationID": "60020828", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine and Public Health & Centre for Neuroscience, Flinders University"}, "6602928946": {"Name": "Dinning P.G.", "AuthorID": "6602928946", "AffiliationID": "60020828", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine and Public Health & Centre for Neuroscience, Flinders University"}, "8337607800": {"Name": "Thapar N.", "AuthorID": "8337607800", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurogastroenterology & Motility, Department of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Great Ormond Street Hospital, and Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "6602467294": {"Name": "Borrelli O.", "AuthorID": "6602467294", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurogastroenterology & Motility, Department of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Great Ormond Street Hospital, and Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7006326158": {"Name": "Di Lorenzo C.", "AuthorID": "7006326158", "AffiliationID": "60080012", "AffiliationName": "Nationwide Children's Hospital"}, "56134324000": {"Name": "Yacob D.T.", "AuthorID": "56134324000", "AffiliationID": "60080012", "AffiliationName": "Nationwide Children's Hospital"}, "57202865659": {"Name": "Baaleman D.F.", "AuthorID": "57202865659", "AffiliationID": "60080012", "AffiliationName": "Nationwide Children's Hospital"}, "57195584323": {"Name": "Vriesman M.H.", "AuthorID": "57195584323", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam"}, "7003532912": {"Name": "Benninga M.A.", "AuthorID": "7003532912", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam"}, "35798448600": {"Name": "Koppen I.J.N.", "AuthorID": "35798448600", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam"}, "7003348777": {"Name": "Nurko S.", "AuthorID": "7003348777", "AffiliationID": "60030521", "AffiliationName": "Center for Motility and Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders, Boston Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "38361467200": {"Name": "El-Chammas K.", "AuthorID": "38361467200", "AffiliationID": "60030440", "AffiliationName": "Neurogastroenterology and Motility Disorders Center, Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center"}, "7101973672": {"Name": "Kaul A.", "AuthorID": "7101973672", "AffiliationID": "60030440", "AffiliationName": "Neurogastroenterology and Motility Disorders Center, Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center"}}}
