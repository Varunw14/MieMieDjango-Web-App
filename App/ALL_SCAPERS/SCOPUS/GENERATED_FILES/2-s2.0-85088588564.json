(See [3, Theorem 3.5] for an early result in this direction.) In the case of an elliptic system of first order, the existence of two-term asymptotics was also established quite early and as in the scalar case Fourier integral operators have been the crucial tool. The complete computation of the coefficient of the second term was obtained only in the 2013 paper [2]. In the present paper we simplify that calculation. The main observation is that with the existence of two-term asymptotics already established, it suffices to study the resolvent as a pseudodifferential operator in order to identify and compute the second coefficient.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues", "Spectral theory"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088588564", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"]], "AuthorData": {"55793782600": {"Name": "Avetisyan Z.", "AuthorID": "55793782600", "AffiliationID": "60029241", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University of California, Santa Barbara"}, "7006709199": {"Name": "Sj\u00f6strand J.", "AuthorID": "7006709199", "AffiliationID": "60031810, 60138536", "AffiliationName": "IMB, Universit\u00e9 de Bourgogne"}, "6603201024": {"Name": "Vassiliev D.", "AuthorID": "6603201024", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
