Herein, we aim to investigate the link between load-induced osteogenesis and the blood supply (bone perfusion and vascular porosity) using an established osteogenic noninvasive model of axial loading. Accordingly, 12 N mechanical loads were applied to the right tibiae of six male C57BL6 mice at 10 -12 wk of age, 3 times/wk for 2 wk. Skeletal perfusion was measured acutely (postloading) and chronically in loaded and contralateral, nonloaded hindlimbs by laser-Doppler imaging. Vascular and lacunar porosity of the cortical bone and tibia load-related changes in trabecular and cortical bone was measured by nanoCT and micro-CT, respectively. We found that the mean skeletal perfusion (loaded: nonloaded limb ratio) increased by 56% immediately following the first loading episode (vs. baseline, P < 0.01), and a similar increase was observed after all loading episodes, demonstrating that these acute responses were conserved for 2 wk of loading. Loading failed, however, to engender any significant chronic changes in mean perfusion between the beginning and the end of the experiment. In contrast, 2 wk of loading engendered an increased vascular canal number in the tibial cortical compartment (midshaft) and, as expected, also increased trabecular and cortical bone volumes and modified tibial architecture in the loaded limb. Our results indicate that each episode of loading both generates acute enhancement in skeletal blood perfusion and also stimulates chronic vascular architectural changes in the bone cortices, which coincide with load-induced increases in bone mass.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083079623", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"36459508600": {"Name": "Gohin S.", "AuthorID": "36459508600", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Comparative Biomedical Sciences, Royal Veterinary College"}, "26025973600": {"Name": "Javaheri B.", "AuthorID": "26025973600", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Comparative Biomedical Sciences, Royal Veterinary College"}, "56583696500": {"Name": "Hopkinson M.", "AuthorID": "56583696500", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Comparative Biomedical Sciences, Royal Veterinary College"}, "57206490569": {"Name": "Pitsillides A.A.", "AuthorID": "57206490569", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Comparative Biomedical Sciences, Royal Veterinary College"}, "57203200421": {"Name": "Chenu C.", "AuthorID": "57203200421", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Comparative Biomedical Sciences, Royal Veterinary College"}, "7003686898": {"Name": "Arnett T.R.", "AuthorID": "7003686898", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}}}
