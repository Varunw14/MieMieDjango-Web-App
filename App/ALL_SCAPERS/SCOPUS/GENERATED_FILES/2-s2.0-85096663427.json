Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The Wnt signalling system is essential for both the developing and adult central nervous system. It regulates numerous cellular functions ranging from neurogenesis to blood brain barrier biology. Dysregulated Wnt signalling can thus have significant consequences for normal brain function, which is becoming increasingly clear in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), an age\u2010related neurodegenerative disorder that is the most prevalent form of dementia. AD exhibits a range of pathophysiological manifestations including aberrant amyloid precursor protein processing, tau pathology, synapse loss, neuroinflammation and blood brain barrier breakdown, which have been associated to a greater or lesser degree with abnormal Wnt signalling. Here we provide a comprehensive overview of the role of Wnt signalling in the CNS, and the research that implicates dysregulated Wnt signalling in the ageing brain and in AD pathogenesis. We also discuss the opportunities for therapeutic intervention in AD via modulation of the Wnt signalling pathway, and highlight some of the challenges and the gaps in our current understanding that need to be met to enable that goal.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "APP processing", "Blood brain barrier", "Neurodegeneration", "Neuroinflammation", "Synapse degeneration", "Tau pathology", "Wnt signalling"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85096663427", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"57191409186": {"Name": "Aghaizu N.D.", "AuthorID": "57191409186", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute, University College London"}, "57220051468": {"Name": "Jin H.", "AuthorID": "57220051468", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute, University College London"}, "7202412883": {"Name": "Whiting P.J.", "AuthorID": "7202412883", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "ARUK Drug Discovery Institute (DDI), University College London"}}}
