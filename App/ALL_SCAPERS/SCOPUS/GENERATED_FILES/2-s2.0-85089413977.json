Methods: Data from 164 mothers with healthy term infants recruited for a randomized trial comparing breast pumps from the UK (n = 68), Russia (n = 51), and China (n = 45) were included in this analysis. Feeding practices were assessed using questionnaires at 3 and 6 months. Maternal attitudes toward infant feeding and infant eating behaviors were measured by Iowa Infant Feeding Attitudes Scale (IIFAS) and Baby Eating Behavior Questionnaire (BEBQ) at 5-6 weeks postpartum; scores were compared between countries and associations with infant feeding at 3 and 6 months were examined. Results: IIFAS score was significantly different between countries; mean scores in Chinese and Russian mothers (China 64.6 \u00b1 4.88 and Russia 61.5 \u00b1 6.15) lay in the range of \"neutral breastfeeding attitudes,\"while British mothers had more positive attitudes (70.6 \u00b1 6.47, post hoc p < 0.001). Russian infants had higher scores for \"general appetite\"(mean = 4.8 \u00b1 0.41, p < 0.05) and \"satiety responsiveness\"(mean = 8.7 \u00b1 1.08, p < 0.01) than Chinese or British infants. Longer duration of full-time education was associated with more positive attitudes toward breastfeeding in the whole sample (p < 0.001) and in the United Kingdom (p < 0.05). The majority of mothers were exclusively breastfeeding (EBF) at 3 months. Total IIFAS and BEBQ scores were not significant predictors of EBF at 3 and 6 months (p > 0.05), although greater agreement with the IIFAS statement \"Formula feeding is more convenient than breastfeeding\"was associated with lower EBF at 3 months (OR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.29-0.78, p < 0.01). Conclusions: Maternal attitudes toward infant feeding and perceptions of infant eating behavior differed between countries, but were not associated with EBF at 6 months. Mothers with a greater baseline perception that formula feeding is more convenient than breastfeeding were less likely to EBF at 3 months; this could be a potential target for education.", "AuthorKeywords": ["breastfeeding", "eating behavior", "infant feeding", "maternal attitude"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089413977", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics", "NURS", "2919"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"], ["Maternity and Midwifery", "NURS", "2913"]], "AuthorData": {"57221098935": {"Name": "Yu J.", "AuthorID": "57221098935", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Childhood Nutrition Research, Population Policy and Practice Research and Teaching Department, Ucl Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7004016103": {"Name": "Fewtrell M.S.", "AuthorID": "7004016103", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Childhood Nutrition Research, Population Policy and Practice Research and Teaching Department, Ucl Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57205465233": {"Name": "Wei Z.", "AuthorID": "57205465233", "AffiliationID": "60073433", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Children's Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical University"}, "6506171809": {"Name": "Lukoyanova O.", "AuthorID": "6506171809", "AffiliationID": "60069625", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nutrition for Sick and Healthy Children, \"national Medical Research Center of Children's Health\", Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation"}, "6603355536": {"Name": "Borovik T.", "AuthorID": "6603355536", "AffiliationID": "60069625", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nutrition for Sick and Healthy Children, \"national Medical Research Center of Children's Health\", Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation"}}}
