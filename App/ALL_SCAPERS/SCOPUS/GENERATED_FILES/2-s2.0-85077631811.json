This study was conducted to psychometrically assess meaningful change in bowel movement frequency among carcinoid syndrome patients using data from the TELESTAR clinical study. Methods: An anchor-based approach for deriving meaningful change thresholds consisted of mapping change from baseline bowel movement frequency to other patient-reported assessments of change. These included the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire - Core Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) Diarrhea Symptom responders, the EORTC Gastrointestinal NET questionnaire (GI.NET21) GI Symptom responders, and reported adequate relief at Week 12 (\u2265 10-point score decrease from Day 1 to Week 12). Parameters included within-group mean change from baseline to Week 12, t-tests of the change (Wilcoxon rank sum for adequate relief), and effect size. Results: There were 135 carcinoid syndrome patients with a mean baseline frequency of 5.7 bowel movements a day. A distribution-based method yielded meaningful change estimates of 0.62 bowel movements a day for overall frequency and 0.83 bowel movements a day at Week 12. Anchor-based analysis indicated a large effect size among patients who reported adequate relief at Week 12 (\u2212 1.58; n = 18; P = 0.014), the QLQ-C30 Diarrhea domain responders (\u2212 1.24; n = 40; P < 0.001), and the GI.NET21 GI Symptoms Domain responders (\u2212 1.49; n = 25; P = 0.005). Exit interview data for meaningful change yielded effect size estimates of \u2212 1.57 for overall change during the Double-blind Treatment Period and \u2212 1.97 for change between Baseline and Week 12. Conclusions: Meaningful change derivation is critical to interpret patient outcomes for evaluating treatment efficacy. In this study, carcinoid syndrome patients experienced clinically meaningful reductions in bowel movement frequency of \u226530% over 12 weeks with telotristat ethyl treatment.
