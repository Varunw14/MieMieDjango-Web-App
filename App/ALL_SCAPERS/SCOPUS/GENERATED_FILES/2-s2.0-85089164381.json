All rights reserved.South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative (SATVI), Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, Department of Pathology, Division of Immunology, University of Cape Town, 7925 Observatory, South Africa,V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells are a major human blood \u03b3\u03b4 T cell population that respond in a T cell receptor (TCR)-dependent manner to phosphoantigens which are generated by a variety of microorganisms. It is not clear how V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells react toward the sudden microbial exposure early after birth. We found that human V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells with a public/shared fetal-derived TCR repertoire expanded within 10 wk postpartum. Such an expansion was not observed in non-V\u03b39V\u03b42 \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, which possessed a private TCR repertoire. Furthermore, only the V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells differentiated into potent cytotoxic effector cells by 10 wk of age, despite their fetal origin. Both the expansion of public fetal V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells and their functional differentiation were not affected by newborn vaccination with the phosphoantigen-containing bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine. These findings suggest a strong and early priming of the public fetal-derived V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells promptly after birth, likely upon environmental phosphoantigen exposure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gammadelta", "Infant", "Newborn", "Tcr repertoire", "VI9vI2"], "IndexKeywords": ["BCG Vaccine", "Cells, Cultured", "Cytokines", "Female", "Fetus", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Pregnancy", "Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta", "T-Lymphocyte Subsets", "T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089164381", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57117519400": {"Name": "Papadopoulou M.", "AuthorID": "57117519400", "AffiliationID": "124934575", "AffiliationName": "U-CRI"}, "6602903958": {"Name": "Vermijlen D.", "AuthorID": "6602903958", "AffiliationID": "124934575", "AffiliationName": "U-CRI"}, "7004676572": {"Name": "Dimova T.", "AuthorID": "7004676572", "AffiliationID": "60000145", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Medical Immunology, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles (ULB)"}, "10138820000": {"Name": "Shey M.", "AuthorID": "10138820000", "AffiliationID": "60095279, 60000356", "AffiliationName": "South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative (SATVI), Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, Department of Pathology, Division of Immunology, University of Cape Town"}, "57218423940": {"Name": "Briel L.", "AuthorID": "57218423940", "AffiliationID": "60095279, 60000356", "AffiliationName": "South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative (SATVI), Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, Department of Pathology, Division of Immunology, University of Cape Town"}, "57218423120": {"Name": "Veldtsman H.", "AuthorID": "57218423120", "AffiliationID": "60095279, 60000356", "AffiliationName": "South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative (SATVI), Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, Department of Pathology, Division of Immunology, University of Cape Town"}, "57210816751": {"Name": "Khomba N.", "AuthorID": "57210816751", "AffiliationID": "60095279, 60000356", "AffiliationName": "South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative (SATVI), Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, Department of Pathology, Division of Immunology, University of Cape Town"}, "56176848900": {"Name": "Africa H.", "AuthorID": "56176848900", "AffiliationID": "60095279, 60000356", "AffiliationName": "South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative (SATVI), Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, Department of Pathology, Division of Immunology, University of Cape Town"}, "57218513725": {"Name": "Steyne M.", "AuthorID": "57218513725", "AffiliationID": "60095279, 60000356", "AffiliationName": "South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative (SATVI), Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, Department of Pathology, Division of Immunology, University of Cape Town"}, "57203977065": {"Name": "Hanekom W.A.", "AuthorID": "57203977065", "AffiliationID": "60095279, 60000356", "AffiliationName": "South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative (SATVI), Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, Department of Pathology, Division of Immunology, University of Cape Town"}, "57216067512": {"Name": "Scriba T.J.", "AuthorID": "57216067512", "AffiliationID": "60095279, 60000356", "AffiliationName": "South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative (SATVI), Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, Department of Pathology, Division of Immunology, University of Cape Town"}, "9234176700": {"Name": "Nemes E.", "AuthorID": "9234176700", "AffiliationID": "60095279, 60000356", "AffiliationName": "South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative (SATVI), Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, Department of Pathology, Division of Immunology, University of Cape Town"}}}
