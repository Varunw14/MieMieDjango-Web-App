To date, there have been few studies of immune function in healthy older people in sub-Saharan Africa. We assessed T cell and B cell phenotypes and immune responses to CMV, EBV, and influenza virus in Malawians aged 20-69 y. Notably, the proportion of naive (CCR7+CD45RA+) CD4 and CD8 T cells was only 14% of the lymphoid repertoire even in donors aged under 30 y but did not decrease further with age. A small increase in the late differentiated (CD27-CD28-) CD8 T cell subpopulation was observed in older donors but the CD4/CD8 T cell ratio remained stable in all age groups. Interestingly, the regulatory (CD25hiFOXP3hi) T cell subpopulation was small in all age groups, and we observed no age-associated accumulation of cells expressing the senescence- and exhaustion-associated markers CD57 and PD-1. We assessed functional T cell responses to mitogenic and viral antigenic stimulation by the expression of CD154, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, and IL-17 and proliferation. All responses were robust across the life course, although we observed an age-associated shift from IFN-\u03b3 to TNF-\u03b1 in the response to EBV. In summary, we found the naive T cell subpopulation of young adult Malawians was smaller than in their contemporaries in high-income settings but remains stable thereafter and that lymphocyte function is retained across the life course. These observations indicate that studies of the genetic and environmental factors influencing immune function in different environments may provide insights into minimizing immune ageing.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Cell Differentiation", "Cytomegalovirus", "Female", "Herpesvirus 4, Human", "Humans", "Immunologic Memory", "Influenza, Human", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Male", "Middle Aged", "T-Lymphocyte Subsets"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071469753", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"16417513600": {"Name": "Miles D.J.C.", "AuthorID": "16417513600", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, Birmingham Health Partners, University of Birmingham"}, "57210809865": {"Name": "Shumba F.", "AuthorID": "57210809865", "AffiliationID": "60072678", "AffiliationName": "Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"}, "7006955721": {"Name": "Corbett E.L.", "AuthorID": "7006955721", "AffiliationID": "60072678", "AffiliationName": "Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"}, "7005251165": {"Name": "Heyderman R.S.", "AuthorID": "7005251165", "AffiliationID": "60072678", "AffiliationName": "Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"}, "50462067400": {"Name": "Pachnio A.", "AuthorID": "50462067400", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, Birmingham Health Partners, University of Birmingham"}, "36176841900": {"Name": "Begum J.", "AuthorID": "36176841900", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, Birmingham Health Partners, University of Birmingham"}, "7103406164": {"Name": "Moss P.", "AuthorID": "7103406164", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, Birmingham Health Partners, University of Birmingham"}}}
