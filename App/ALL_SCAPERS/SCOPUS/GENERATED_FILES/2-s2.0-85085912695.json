Aim: the aim of this study was to conduct a preliminary evaluation of how Italian clinicians (psychologists and pediatricians) perceive gender variant children and adolescents, evaluating their approach to clinical practice. Methods: An online questionnaire directed to clinicians regarding their experience with, and perceptions of, gender variant children and adolescents was used for the first part of the research. In the second part of this study, Consensual Qualitative Research (CQR) methodology was applied to semi-structured interviews aimed at investigating clinicians\u2019 approach to clinical practice. Results: Professionals reported 374 cases, including 200 children (aged 2\u201311 years) and 174 adolescents (aged 12\u201319 years); a total of 10 interviews were conducted with professionals. Conclusion: This study highlights the increase of gender variant children and adolescents seen by professionals, but also the poor awareness of Italian professionals about gender diversity and their care, as well as an absence of a network model of intervention.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adolescence", "childhood", "Gender diverse youth", "transgender care", "transgender youth"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85085912695", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57193341361": {"Name": "Fortunato A.", "AuthorID": "57193341361", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dynamic and Clinical Psychology, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "57193340887": {"Name": "Giovanardi G.", "AuthorID": "57193340887", "AffiliationID": "60026777", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Campania \u201cLuigi Vanvitelli"}, "57212958052": {"Name": "Mirabella M.", "AuthorID": "57212958052", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dynamic and Clinical Psychology, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "7005367969": {"Name": "Speranza A.M.", "AuthorID": "7005367969", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dynamic and Clinical Psychology, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "6603429203": {"Name": "Lingiardi V.", "AuthorID": "6603429203", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dynamic and Clinical Psychology, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "7003418428": {"Name": "Caviglia G.", "AuthorID": "7003418428", "AffiliationID": "60026777", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Campania \u201cLuigi Vanvitelli"}, "6508024959": {"Name": "Di Ceglie D.", "AuthorID": "6508024959", "AffiliationID": "60020150", "AffiliationName": "Gender Identity Development Service, Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
