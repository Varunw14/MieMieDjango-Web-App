We aim to establish an unsupervised deep learning pipeline for vertebral segmentation of MR images. We integrate the sub-optimal segmentation results produced by a rule-based method with a unique voting mechanism to provide supervision in the training process for the deep learning model. Preliminary validation shows a high segmentation accuracy achieved by our method without relying on any manual labelling.The clinical relevance of this study is that it provides an efficient vertebral segmentation method with high accuracy. Potential applications are in automated pathology detection and vertebral 3D reconstructions for biomechanical simulations and 3D printing, facilitating clinical decision making, surgical planning and tissue engineering.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["3D reconstruction", "Biomechanical simulation", "Clinical decision making", "Optimal segmentation", "Rule-based method", "Segmentation accuracy", "Surgical planning", "Vertebral segmentation"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091022089", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"57219007314": {"Name": "Kuang X.", "AuthorID": "57219007314", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "University of Hong Kong, Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology"}, "24554121300": {"Name": "Cheung J.P.Y.", "AuthorID": "24554121300", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "University of Hong Kong, Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology"}, "34874014100": {"Name": "Wu H.", "AuthorID": "34874014100", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "University of Hong Kong, Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology"}, "6701773594": {"Name": "Dokos S.", "AuthorID": "6701773594", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "University of Hong Kong, Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology"}, "57213164472": {"Name": "Zhang T.", "AuthorID": "57213164472", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "University of Hong Kong, Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology"}}}
