Through analysis of semi-structured interviews, we explored the experiences of home care workers (n = 30) and managers of home care services (n = 13) in England (2016\u201317). Both groups sought to collaboratively establish formal and informal practices of teamwork. Beyond the home care agency, experiences of interacting with the wider health and care workforce differed. More explicit encouragement of support for home care workers is needed by other professionals and their employers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dementia", "End of life", "Health professionals", "Home care", "Teamwork"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089688487", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"7006601649": {"Name": "Manthorpe J.", "AuthorID": "7006601649", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King\u2019s College London"}, "24779032000": {"Name": "Samsi K.", "AuthorID": "24779032000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King\u2019s College London"}, "12244092500": {"Name": "Vandrevala T.", "AuthorID": "12244092500", "AffiliationID": "60033359", "AffiliationName": "Kingston University"}, "57204650923": {"Name": "Abrams R.", "AuthorID": "57204650923", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
