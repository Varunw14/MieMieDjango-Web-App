Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.This paper seeks to address the question how people go about intercultural differences in an institutional setting which aims to mediate between the socio-legal system and the \u2018outsiders\u2019 of the system, i.e. ordinary citizens, through an investigation of professional interactions between a legal advisor and her clients of Eastern European backgrounds in London. Drawing data from a linguistic ethnography, the analysis foregrounds the practice of resemiotisation and calibration. The second aim is to extend the notion of \u2018intercultural moments\u2019 and to explore its analytical benefits in understanding fleeting and seemingly mundane moments in encounters.", "AuthorKeywords": ["calibration", "ethnography", "institutional interaction", "Intercultural moments", "resemiotisation", "socio-legal advice"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074006677", "SubjectAreas": [["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"23990554100": {"Name": "Hua Z.", "AuthorID": "23990554100", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Linguistics and Communication, Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "57208568408": {"Name": "Jankowicz-Pytel D.", "AuthorID": "57208568408", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Linguistics and Communication, Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "7402951126": {"Name": "Wei L.", "AuthorID": "7402951126", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
