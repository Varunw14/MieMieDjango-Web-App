Most patients are diagnosed with advanced disease which carries significant mortality. Improvements in treatment have only resulted in modest increases in survival. This has driven efforts to reduce mortality through screening. Multimodal ovarian cancer screening using a longitudinal CA125 algorithm has resulted in diagnosis at an earlier stage, both in average and high risk women in two large UK trials. However, no randomised controlled trial has demonstrated a definitive mortality benefit. Extended follow up is underway in the largest trial to date, UKCTOCS, to explore the delayed reduction in mortality that was noted. Meanwhile, screening is not currently recommended in the general population Some countries offer surveillance of high risk women. Novel screening modalities and longitudinal biomarker algorithms offer potential improvements to future screening strategies as does the development of better risk stratification tools.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Early detection", "Ovarian cancer", "Screening"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomarkers, Tumor", "CA-125 Antigen", "Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial", "Early Detection of Cancer", "Female", "Humans", "Mass Screening", "Ovarian Neoplasms", "Ovariectomy", "Prognosis", "Risk Factors", "Sensitivity and Specificity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082863956", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"57193795799": {"Name": "Nash Z.", "AuthorID": "57193795799", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL, Institute of Clinical Trials & Methodology, University College London"}, "57205054428": {"Name": "Menon U.", "AuthorID": "57205054428", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL, Institute of Clinical Trials & Methodology, University College London"}}}
