The reaction process operates under benchtop conditions without the requirement for a (dry) solvent, an inert atmosphere, or catalyst preactivation. The reaction is finished within 3 h. The reaction is demonstrated across a broad range of substrates; the inclusion of zinc metal has been found to be critical in some instances, especially for coupling of alkyl thiols.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85092057698", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"57210447240": {"Name": "Jones A.C.", "AuthorID": "57210447240", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff Catalysis Institute, School of Chemistry, Cardiff University, Main Building"}, "57195756684": {"Name": "Nicholson W.I.", "AuthorID": "57195756684", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff Catalysis Institute, School of Chemistry, Cardiff University, Main Building"}, "57217136464": {"Name": "Smallman H.R.", "AuthorID": "57217136464", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, UCL"}, "23018311500": {"Name": "Browne D.L.", "AuthorID": "23018311500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, UCL"}}}
