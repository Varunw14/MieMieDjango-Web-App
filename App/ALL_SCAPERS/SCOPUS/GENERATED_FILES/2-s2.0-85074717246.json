We derive the limiting null distribution of the test statistic as an integrated squared Gaussian process, obtain the corresponding covariance operator and oscillation properties of its eigenfunctions, show that the eigenvalues of the operator satisfy an interlacing property, and make applications to two data sets. We prove consistency of the test, provide numerical power comparisons with alternative tests, study the test statistic under several contiguous alternatives, and obtain the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic for gamma alternatives with varying rate or shape parameters and for certain contaminated gamma models. We investigate the approximate Bahadur slope of the test statistic under local alternatives, and we establish the validity of the Wieand condition under which approaches through the approximate Bahadur and the Pitman efficiencies are in accord.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bahadur slope", "Contaminated model", "Contiguous alternative", "Gaussian process", "Generalized Laguerre polynomial", "Goodness-of-fit testing", "Hankel transform", "Hilbert\u2013Schmidt operator", "Lipschitz continuity", "Modified Bessel function", "Pitman efficiency"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85074717246", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"]], "AuthorData": {"57193409989": {"Name": "Hadjicosta E.", "AuthorID": "57193409989", "AffiliationID": "60001439", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, Pennsylvania State University"}, "7401578938": {"Name": "Richards D.", "AuthorID": "7401578938", "AffiliationID": "60001439", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, Pennsylvania State University"}}}
