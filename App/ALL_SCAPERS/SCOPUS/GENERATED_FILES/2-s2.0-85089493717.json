We have previously demonstrated reduction in a specific subpopulation of Treg in AA, which predicts response to immunosuppression. The aims of the present study were to define mechanisms of Treg subpopulation imbalance and identify potential for therapeutic intervention. We have identified 2 mechanisms that lead to skewed Treg composition in AA: first, FasL-mediated apoptosis on ligand interaction; and, second, relative interleukin-2 (IL-2) deprivation. We have shown that IL-2 augmentation can overcome these mechanisms. Interestingly, when high concentrations of IL-2 were used for in vitro Treg expansion cultures, AA Tregs were able to expand. The expanded populations expressed a high level of p-BCL-2, which makes them resistant to apoptosis. Using a xenograft mouse model, the function and stability of expanded AA Tregs were tested. We have shown that these Tregs were able to suppress the macroscopic clinical features and tissue manifestations of T-cell-mediated graft-versus-host disease. These Tregs maintained their suppressive properties as well as their phenotype in a highly inflammatory environment. Our findings provide an insight into the mechanisms of Treg reduction in AA. We have identified novel targets with potential for therapeutic interventions. Supplementation of ex vivo expansion cultures of Tregs with high concentrations of IL-2 or delivery of IL-2 directly to patients could improve clinical outcomes in addition to standard immunosuppressive therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089493717", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57201558873": {"Name": "Lim S.P.", "AuthorID": "57201558873", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London"}, "36479917200": {"Name": "Costantini B.", "AuthorID": "36479917200", "AffiliationID": "60085015", "AffiliationName": "AOU Ospedali Riuniti Umberto I - Lancisi - Salesi, Clinica di Ematologia"}, "34973260700": {"Name": "Mian S.A.", "AuthorID": "34973260700", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Haematopoietic Stem Cell Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute"}, "55277890500": {"Name": "Abellan P.P.", "AuthorID": "55277890500", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Haematological Medicine, King's College Hospital"}, "7401946581": {"Name": "Marsh J.C.W.", "AuthorID": "7401946581", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Haematological Medicine, King's College Hospital"}, "55950581200": {"Name": "Mufti G.J.", "AuthorID": "55950581200", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Haematological Medicine, King's College Hospital"}, "24491769100": {"Name": "Abarrategi A.", "AuthorID": "24491769100", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Haematopoietic Stem Cell Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute"}, "6601980638": {"Name": "Ariza-McNaughton L.", "AuthorID": "6601980638", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Haematopoietic Stem Cell Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute"}, "57203532582": {"Name": "Bonnet D.", "AuthorID": "57203532582", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Haematopoietic Stem Cell Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute"}, "21733336600": {"Name": "Gandhi S.", "AuthorID": "21733336600", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Haematological Medicine, King's College Hospital"}, "57194138956": {"Name": "Llordella M.M.", "AuthorID": "57194138956", "AffiliationID": "60177635, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Inflammation Biology and Cancer Immunology, King's College London"}, "55821932700": {"Name": "Povoleri G.A.M.", "AuthorID": "55821932700", "AffiliationID": "60177635, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Inflammation Biology and Cancer Immunology, King's College London"}, "7103062769": {"Name": "Lozano J.J.", "AuthorID": "7103062769", "AffiliationID": "60078879", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red de Enfermedades Hep\u00e1ticas y Digestivas (CIBERehd) Bioinformatics Platform"}, "57219671690": {"Name": "dos Reis R.A.", "AuthorID": "57219671690", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Systems Cancer Immunology Laboratory, CRUK-KHP Cancer Centre, School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London"}, "18836332400": {"Name": "Kordasti S.", "AuthorID": "18836332400", "AffiliationID": "60009797", "AffiliationName": "Haematology Department, Guy's Hospital"}, "57188986549": {"Name": "Mourikis T.P.", "AuthorID": "57188986549", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Systems Biology Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute"}, "16942428600": {"Name": "Heck S.", "AuthorID": "16942428600", "AffiliationID": "60005518, 60172674", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, BRC Flow Core, Guy's and St Thomas Hospital"}, "7101847425": {"Name": "Irish J.M.", "AuthorID": "7101847425", "AffiliationID": "60003915", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt University"}, "7202583024": {"Name": "Lombardi G.", "AuthorID": "7202583024", "AffiliationID": "60177635, 60011520, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Transplantation, Peter Gorer Department of Immunobiology, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London"}}}
