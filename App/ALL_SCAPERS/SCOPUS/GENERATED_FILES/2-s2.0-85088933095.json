Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Comparative assessment of the relative information content of different independent spatial data types is necessary to evaluate whether they provide congruent biogeographic signals for predicting species ranges. Opportunistic occurrence records and systematically collected survey data are available from the Dominican Republic for Hispaniola\u2019s surviving endemic non-volant mammals, the Hispaniolan solenodon (Solenodon paradoxus) and Hispaniolan hutia (Plagiodontia aedium); opportunistic records (archaeological, historical and recent) exist from across the entire country, and systematic survey data have been collected from seven protected areas. Species distribution models were developed in maxent for solenodons and hutias using both data types, with species habitat suitability and potential country-level distribution predicted using seven biotic and abiotic environmental variables. Three different models were produced and compared for each species: (a) opportunistic model, with starting model incorporating abiotic-only predictors; (b) total survey model, with starting model incorporating biotic and abiotic predictors; and (c) reduced survey model, with starting model incorporating abiotic-only predictors to allow further comparison with the opportunistic model. All models predict suitable environmental conditions for both solenodons and hutias across a broadly congruent, relatively large area of the Dominican Republic, providing a spatial baseline of conservation-priority landscapes that might support native mammals. Correlation between total and reduced survey models is high for both species, indicating the substantial explanatory power of abiotic variables for predicting Hispaniolan mammal distributions. However, correlation between survey models and opportunistic models is only moderately positive. Species distribution models derived from different data types can provide different predictions about habitat suitability and conservation-priority landscapes for threatened species, likely reflecting incompleteness and bias in spatial sampling associated with both data types. Models derived using both opportunistic and systematic data must therefore be applied critically and cautiously.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dominican Republic", "historical records", "hutia", "maxent", "solenodon", "species distribution model"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088933095", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Nature and Landscape Conservation", "ENVI", "2309"]], "AuthorData": {"8608216100": {"Name": "Turvey S.T.", "AuthorID": "8608216100", "AffiliationID": "60009498, 60005453", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "55656978900": {"Name": "Hudson M.A.", "AuthorID": "55656978900", "AffiliationID": "60030656", "AffiliationName": "Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust"}, "56690322300": {"Name": "Kennerley R.J.", "AuthorID": "56690322300", "AffiliationID": "60030656", "AffiliationName": "Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust"}, "24477979600": {"Name": "Nu\u00f1ez-Mi\u00f1o J.M.", "AuthorID": "24477979600", "AffiliationID": "60030656", "AffiliationName": "Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust"}, "14720492700": {"Name": "Young R.P.", "AuthorID": "14720492700", "AffiliationID": "60030656", "AffiliationName": "Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust"}}}
