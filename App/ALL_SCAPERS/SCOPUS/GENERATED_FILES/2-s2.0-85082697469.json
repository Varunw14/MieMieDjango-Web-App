Many ciliary proteins are essential for normal photoreceptor function and cilium dysfunction often results in retinal degeneration leading to impaired vision. Herein, we investigate the function and localization of the ciliary G-protein RAB28 in zebrafish cone photoreceptors. CRISPR-Cas9 generated rab28 mutant zebrafish display significantly reduced shed outer segment material/phagosomes in the RPE at 1 month post fertilization (mpf), but otherwise normal visual function up to 21 dpf and retinal structure up to 12 mpf. Cone photoreceptor-specific transgenic reporter lines show Rab28 localizes almost exclusively to outer segments, independently of GTP/GDP nucleotide binding. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrates tagged Rab28 interacts with components of the phototransduction cascade, including opsins, phosphodiesterase 6C and guanylate cyclase 2D. Our data shed light on RAB28 function in cones and provide a model for RAB28-associated cone-rod dystrophy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cilia", "outer segment", "photoreceptor", "retinal degeneration", "small G protein", "visual function", "zebrafish"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85082697469", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57191526002": {"Name": "Carter S.P.", "AuthorID": "57191526002", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "57212679609": {"Name": "Moran A.L.", "AuthorID": "57212679609", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "UCD Conway Institute, University College Dublin"}, "57201560247": {"Name": "Blacque O.E.", "AuthorID": "57201560247", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "UCD Conway Institute, University College Dublin"}, "55427388400": {"Name": "Kennedy B.N.", "AuthorID": "55427388400", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "UCD Conway Institute, University College Dublin"}, "6603299089": {"Name": "Matallanas D.", "AuthorID": "6603299089", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "Systems Biology Ireland, University College Dublin"}, "36739432100": {"Name": "McManus G.J.", "AuthorID": "36739432100", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Microscopy Facility, Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute, Trinity College Dublin"}}}
